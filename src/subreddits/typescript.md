Hi,

I wonder what's the best way of sharing the same data types between the client (React) and the server (Express + Socket.IO).

In my game I have different rooms, each room saves the current status, something like:

```js
class GameRoom {
    players: Player[];
    started: boolean;
    currentPlayerTurn; Player;
    dices: [number, number];

    constructor({players = [], started = false, currentPlayerTurn = null, dices = [1,1]) {
        this.players = players;
        this.started = started;
        this.currentPlayerTurn = currentPlayerTurn;
        this.dices = dices;
    }

    startGame() {
        this.currentPlayerTurn = this.players[0];
        this.started = true;
    }
    
    // etc..
}
```

The room is being generated in the server, being sent to the client as JSON, and then rebuilt in the client. I sync the data with socket events, and everything's perfect.

But there's a problem with the React side of the story: changing `GameRoom` properties won't cause a rerender. That means I have to `forceRerender()` each time something is edited, or listen to class changes. Both options are a mess and I [described it deeply on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61142978/make-a-react-component-rerender-when-data-class-property-change/).

This mess made me think maybe classes are not the best way to go. Using interface will solve this problem entirely, but I do lose instance functions like `GameRoom.startGame()`, that will have to be turned into utility functions, like:

```js
export function startGame(gameRoom: GameRoom) {
    gameRoom.currentPlayerTurn = gameRoom.players[0];
    gameRoom.started = true;
}
```

which is another mess, since they're hidden in code, and the developer **needs to know they exist**, and not edit `gameRoom` directly.

If you guys have any idea on how to model my data types, I'd be more than happy to hear.\
Thanks!

Hi,

so in typescript, once we define an object like this 

```
const parsedData = {
            serviceType,
            stops,
            deliveries,
            requesterContact: {
                name: pickup.personInChargeName,
                phone: merchantPhoneValidator(pickup.personInChargePhoneNum),
            },
            specialRequests,
        };
```
Then we cannot dynamically add more fields like javascript
```
// error 
if (isPreOrder) {
       parsedData.scheduleAt = new Date(pickup.startAt).toISOString();
}
```
Nor we can add dummy field just letting typescript know we have this field
```
const parsedData = {
            scheduleAt : undefined  // error
            serviceType,
            stops,
            deliveries,
            requesterContact: {
                name: pickup.personInChargeName,
                phone: merchantPhoneValidator(pickup.personInChargePhoneNum),
            },
            specialRequests,
        };
```

Any better way to get around with this except disabling typescript? Thanks!

I've seen setups for debugging Frontend code with source maps, and complex configurations for debugging entire typescript projects in vscode with sourcemaps.  


However, what if I have a project that is in Vanilla Node.js, but some of my dependencies are in Typescript? How do I debug those in vscode or chrome?

So I just started using GraphQL Nexus today and I'm just doing some basic setup and noodling around with some stuff. I coded a simple registerUser mutation like so:

`export const Mutation = objectType({`  
  `name: 'Mutation',`  
 `definition(t) {`  
 `t.boolean('register', {`  
`args: {`  
`email: stringArg({ required: true }),`  
`password: stringArg({ required: true }),`  
 `},`  
`async resolve(_, { email, password }) {`  
 `console.log(password, email)`  
`return true`  
 `},`  
 `})`  
 `},`  
`})`

But when I replaced the arguments to 'register' with a RegisterInput input like so:

`export const RegisterInput = inputObjectType({`  
  `name: 'RegisterInput',`  
 `definition(t) {`  
 `t.string('email', { required: true })`  
 `t.string('password', { required: true })`  
 `},`  
`})`  


`export const Mutation = objectType({`  
  `name: 'Mutation',`  
 `definition(t) {`  
 `t.boolean('register', {`  
`args: {`  
`input: arg({ type: RegisterInput }),`  
 `},`  
`async resolve(_, { input: { email, password } }) {`  
 `console.log(password, email)`  
`return true`  
 `},`  
 `})`  
 `},`  
`})`

Everything works, but he resolver input argument `{ input: { email, password } }` gets typescript a little complain - Property 'email'/'password' does not exist on type '{ email: string; password: string; } | null | undefined'? How do I get those annoying red squiggles to go away?

I'm creating a new MongoDB document in a GraphQL Nexus resolver:

`async resolve(_, { input: { email, password } }, { userData }) {`  
 `const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10)`  
 `let newUser = {`  
  `email,`  
  `password: hashedPassword,`  
 `}`  
 `const { insertedId } = await userData.insertOne(newUser)`  
 `newUser._id = insertedId`  
  `return newUser`  
 `},`

but typescript says property '\_id' does not exist on type '{ email: string; password: string; }'. I'm stuck because this is how I create a new document in mongo using plain JS. What is the proper way to add the insertedId?

[https://pastebin.com/hNgyeeBx](https://pastebin.com/hNgyeeBx)

I'm using a Map to match up the possible values of a \`Select\` to different comparators. When the user changes the dropdown, they can sort the elements differently. The code runs fine, but typescript doesn't like it.

I've tried a lot of different solutions to this: enum, casting, guard statement, and I'm out of ideas.

      if (comparator) {
        return SKILLS.sort(comparator); // `comparator` has a typescript error here:
        // TS2345: Argument of type 'Function' is not assignable to parameter
        // of type '(a: Skill, b: Skill) =&gt; number'. Type 'Function' provides
        // no match for the signature '(a: Skill, b: Skill): number'.
      }

Thanks in advance for any help!
