- **Improve your chances** by adding a minimal example with [JSFiddle][jsfiddle], [CodeSandbox][code sandbox], or [Stackblitz][stackblitz].
  - Describe what you want it to do, and things you've tried. Don't just post big blocks of code!
  - **[Formatting Code][wiki formatting code]** wiki shows how to format code in this thread.
- **Pay it forward!** Answer questions even if there is already an answer. Other perspectives can be helpful to beginners. Also, there's no quicker way to learn than [being wrong on the Internet][being wrong on the internet].

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

This list contains 258 remote jobs and you can filter them by location or skills.

Here I would like to share the entire remote jobs list from the big list of opportunities. All these are 100% remote jobs not just allowed to work from home during this crisis. These are 100% remote jobs and will continue to follow that after the crisis.

https://remoteleaf.com/whoishiring   
Note: Select "javascript" in the skills filter to see javascript dev jobs.

âœ… 100% remote full-time jobs.   
âœ… Spent more than 32 hours to curate this information

Hello, developers!

I just launched a React lecture for real beginners.

The lecture only covers the basic fundamentals of React,

excluding Hooks, Context API, and other difficult content.

So, this lecture is the best way to start learning React.

&amp;#x200B;

The lecture is charged,

but I attachedÂ **FREE**Â coupon link above(valid only 3 days).

(Expires 07/24/2020 04:07 AM PDT (GMT -7))

So, if anyone who wants to learn React,

apply before the coupon expires.

Thank youÂ ðŸ˜€
