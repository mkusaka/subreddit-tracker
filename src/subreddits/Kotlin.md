[Breakout screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/9iqvhlcgopm51.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38b8251304e750c638d71e24c1f8f4f02ba647e)

The 11.11 release is now mobile-compatible, meaning existing FXGL games can be compiled to Android (if you have Linux) and iOS (if you have Mac OS).

Sample games (a few of which are in Kotlin) and instructions are available at [FXGLGames](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames#build-for-mobile) As this is the first stable build, the process will be refined in future releases, based on feedback.

Breakout on Android demo can be seen in the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1304731964323307520)

Whilst the demo used is written in Java, FXGL DSL and API try to be nice to both Java and Kotlin devs. So you can write Kotlin only, Java only, or Java-Kotlin hybrid source games.

Should you wish to explore the FXGL engine's sources, most of the internals are written in Kotlin: [GitHub](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) where you can also report any issues.

Thanks for checking out!

If you are a vim user and use the plugin coc.nvim (which is an autocompleter and much more for vim, here is the repo [https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim))  I want to create an extension for Kotlin. Unfortunately I am not very skilled in TypeScript (but I will use my energy in learning and finishing this) so if anyone is interested in helping me and contributing to the extension you are very much welcome. Here is the repo: [https://github.com/isaac025/coc-kotlin](https://github.com/isaac025/coc-kotlin) feel free for any suggestions. I am planning on using/forking VScode's Kotlin completer: [https://github.com/fwcd/vscode-kotlin](https://github.com/fwcd/vscode-kotlin)
