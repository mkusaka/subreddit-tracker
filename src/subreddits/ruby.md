Hi, rubyists,

It is time to dig a little deeper into Module inclusion in Ruby, and I wrote *short* post about two ways of include Module inside your Class with arguments.

Hi ruby family,

As an initiative to give back to the community, I have started writing a series of blogs on ruby and ruby on rails. Planning to create more content in the future to help share the knowledge. I just published a post about Authorization on Ruby on Rails using CanCanCan. Do check it out and let me know your thoughts.
