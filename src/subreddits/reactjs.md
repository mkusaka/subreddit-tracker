We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [10][Firebase alternative?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ev3pw1/firebase_alternative/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ev3pw1/firebase_alternative/
---
So I'm creating a website in Reactjs which is kind of like a phonebook. There is an option to filter people by different parameters like age, city, country and many other parameters, and also to order by ascending order or descending order.

Recently I added the option to create very complex compound queries, for example: 

    collection.where("Country","==","USA").where("City","==","Boston").where("Age","==","42").where(...).where(...)......

But it seems like firestore requires an index to be created manually for every different permutation. Since I plan on having over 10 filters, it seems like I'd have to create over 3 billion different indices? From what I read, firestore is not meant for such queries.

Is there a platform that allows such complex compound queries, and that is as simple to implement as firebase? 

Thanks!
## [11][Having issues with menu on Reactjs.org official site](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ev2fol/having_issues_with_menu_on_reactjsorg_official/)

Dear developers,

On [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org) doc page, for some reason on Chrome, I cannot use the menu on the side. It just won't respond to my clicks. Whilst if I try the same page on Firefox, it works. But Chrome is my main browser.

Extensions running: ScriptBlock and Adblock.  
On ScriptBlock, I've already set [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org) domain to Allow and have disabled Adblock. This didn't change the result to my issue.

I tried Chrome without add-ons, it still won't work. The menu items won't expand/collapse. For example, when going to  [https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)  and I try to click on Main Concept, it does nothing.  


Why is this happening?
