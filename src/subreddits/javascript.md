Hello. I'm android developer. I've never used JavaScript before and I don't have experienced js developer to ask them questions I have, so I decided to make post here.  
Firstly, I wanna ask you - why do you use exactly JavaScript. As android developer I used to use Java but when Kotlin was released I switched to it, because it's much better. You have TypeScript and Kotlin as well that can be compiled into js. Do you think they are worse than js?  
Secondly, why do you use a notepad-like IDEs (sublime or even notepad itself). I advised my friend to use WebStorm but he flatly refused.  
Thirdly, (I don't know is this question appropriate to this subreddit but anyway) why js is used in backend? Is it better than other compilable languages?
