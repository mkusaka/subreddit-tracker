I've been trying to get values from an ajax response -- without any success, the closest I got was getting an array of undignified.

`$.each(JSON.parse(response,function(i,value){console.log(value[1].schools);}));`

Here is a screenshot of my ajax response

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[json response](https://preview.redd.it/yatsndxokag41.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d83834a4e53f7f5e2d61aa1a107527d50d4a2a45)

&amp;#x200B;

I need to store name + success:false + column + message to a variable

Thanks for your help!
