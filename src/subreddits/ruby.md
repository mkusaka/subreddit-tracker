Hey ruby lovers,

I published the new chapter of **API-only** ruby on rails course. In this chapter, we're building the user creation endpoint. You can check it out from [duetcode.io](https://duetcode.io/rails-api-only-course/implement-user-creation-api-endpoint).  


Last week, I posted the [first two chapters](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/hhb1ib/just_started_to_publish_apionly_ruby_on_rails/) to this subreddit, I got some instructive feedback. Please let me know, what do you think about the new chapter or the website itself.

Cheers!

Underneath some examples of recursion I found I have the steps I think the code is doing, but my answers writing out what I think the code is doing ends up being different than the actual solution. I don't think I quite understand what it's doing everytime it does the method again. Usually I can reverse engineer the solution to figure out the logic, but this is really hard.

We need to embed a fairly complex dashboard on a portal that will be seen by a user after they've logged in.

 Initially we were going to do this using a solution like Tableau or Power BI embedded, but due to costs involved, we feel it's more sustainable if we build our own solution using an existing dashboarding library instead.

I figure someone here has to have done something like this using Ruby on Rails. I'm looking for suggestions for what the best libraries might be - possibly something like Plotly?
