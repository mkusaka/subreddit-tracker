Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

 I've recently launched [AppScreens.com](https://appscreens.com/) and would love to receive your feedback!

As a fellow Android developer, I’ve muddled for years with Photoshop &amp; 50 different PSD files, tried every frustrating/limited screenshot system out there &amp; overpaid for the pleasure. Over time we’ve created some great content but we knew we could be doing better for our time, money, sanity and App Store Optimisation.

AppScreens a state-of-the-art screenshot creator for designing and exporting standout screenshots for both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store at the same time, from one responsive design.

AppScreens helps developers &amp; app businesses save significant time &amp; money where typically a designer or specific skills-set is required. Using our beautiful launch ready templates, apps can boost their app store impact by over 35%.

AppScreens is the most technologically loaded and fully featured screenshot creator tool out there. The tool enables you to have panoramic backgrounds, language localization, integrated 3D perspective phones, hundreds of device &amp; colour combos, rich text and unlimited layout flexibility.

AppScreen's top 5 highlight reel;

1. Automated panoramic backgrounds (Important for ASO engagement)
2. 3D devices &amp; image warping
3. Unlimited layouts and element (text/img/device) layering / stacking
4. Full rich text &amp; emoji support
5. Project translations / localization

Providing you have an idea what you want to say &amp; and the screens you will show, you can be in-and-out in less than 15 minutes with 50+ images ready for upload. That’s a huge efficiency!

Since the AMA is over I was wondering what the community thought about the team responses.

Were your questions answered? Did you like the answer provided?

To me it felt kinda underwhelming with a lot of PR answers and the "we're working to make developers experience positive" along with "we will still not enforce OEMs for developers to have a consistent experience" type of answers

Me and a friend want to start freelancing in android development during summers we have experience in other languages like c++ and python but none in android dev. We both have googled quite a bit but cant seem to decide between Java, Kotlin and Flutter. We want to get into freelancing as soon as possible, so what should we go for.

Which process/action/library or anything (any part of the dev process) causes you the most frustration or what part of the dev process feels like a chore?

Just really interested in hearing as many different opinions or points of view as possible on this front?

Hey everyone,

I'm trying to debug a problem our customer has with our website and this is a screenshot they sent us. I'm not too familiar with the Android ecosystem but tried various browsers in the emulator and still cannot figure out which browser is this according to the frame. According to the toolbar at the bottom it seems to be some kind of web view embedded within an email client (Outlook maybe) but I'm not able to reproduce the scenario. Would anyone be able to identify this setup?
