## [3][Question about a Plugin System](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fr5w6w/question_about_a_plugin_system/)

Hello everyone,

I was thinking about a runtime plugin system for my library ([https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles/](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles/)).

Using the library as sample some features can be external plugins like PolygonMask (that also adds a dependency to pathseg).

My idea is about adding the plugin script in the HTML and it will be added to the main container without any additional line of code.

Somebody know how to do it? No external libraries, I want to keep the project dependency-free (except pathseg, chrome forced me to add it) for now.

I am just messing around with typescript and react-apollo for the first time. I have a component

import React from 'react'  
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'  
import { trailCount, trailCountVariables } from './\_\_generated\_\_/trailCount'  
import { TrailStatus } from '../../\_\_generated\_\_/globalTypes'  
export const TRAIL\_COUNT = gql\`   
query trailCount($status: TrailStatus) {  
trailCount(status: $status)  
}  
\`  
export const Mountains: any = () =&gt; {  
   const { data, loading, error } = useQuery&lt;trailCount, trailCountVariables&gt;(TRAIL\_COUNT, {  
variables: { status: TrailStatus.OPEN }  
})  
if (loading) return &lt;div&gt;Grabing Trail Info&lt;/div&gt;  
if (error) return console.error(error)  
   return &lt;div&gt;{data?.trailCount}&lt;/div&gt;

}

1.) The types for the query and the queryVariables were auto generated by the apollo-codegen tool, and it generated `import { TrailStatus } from '../../__generated__/globalTypes'` outside of the project src/ directory which failed at compiled time because it wasn't within src/. I added the same file to src/ and it worked, but is this a problem with apollo or am I doing something wrong?

2.) The Function Component Mountains I typed as any because I couldn't figure out  what type it should be. How should I type function components that will have apollo queries and mutations?

3.) Why does the Mountains component have to return data?.trailCount and not trailCount?

4.) Are there any resources out there that I'm not finding that will help me through this? I'm having trouble finding resources that help me with typescript+apollo+hooks/Function Components.

Hello all!  


I am trying to use Typescript with react-bootstrap and I have the following problem:

How can I use my own variant? If I use this:
```
&lt;Button variant="myownvariant"
```
Typescript complains about it because Button uses the following props interface:

```
export interface ButtonProps {
  active?: boolean;
  block?: boolean;
  variant?:
    | 'primary'
    | 'secondary'
    | 'success'
    | 'danger'
    | 'warning'
    | 'info'
    | 'dark'
    | 'light'
    | 'link'
    | 'outline-primary'
    | 'outline-secondary'
    | 'outline-success'
    | 'outline-danger'
    | 'outline-warning'
    | 'outline-info'
    | 'outline-dark'
    | 'outline-light';
```
Thank you in advance and regards.

## [8][How do I access object literal properties with a string?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fqnzwt/how_do_i_access_object_literal_properties_with_a/)

There is a very common pattern I use in JavaScript:

    var test = {
        foo: 123,
        bar: 'bar',
        baz: true
    }[someString] || 'defaultValue';

However, in TypeScript the same thing becomes more verbose and ugly. Notice the unsafe cast which "lies" to TypeScript, because `someString` is very possibly not a key of this object:

    var obj = {
        foo: 123,
        bar: 'bar',
        baz: true
    };
    var test = obj[someString as keyof typeof obj] || 'defaultValue';

I know I can use `Record&lt;...&gt;` to type `obj`, but that's not what `obj` really is. Ideally, I want behavior like this:

    obj['some random string'] // undefined, typed as undefined
    obj['foo'] // 123, typed as number
    obj['baz'] // true, typed as boolean
    obj[stringVariable] // number | string | boolean | undefined

So, almost the same thing that happens in TypeScript by default, except that it should allow to get values by arbitrary string keys and be aware of the result being possibly undefined.

I know that the pattern I describe is extremely common. What is the "standard" way to achieve this? It's possible to do something like `Record&lt;'foo' | 'bar' | 'baz', number | string | boolean&gt;`, but I want the keys and value types to be inferred, without listing them twice, which is unfeasible for larger objects.

Thanks!

For a while now, whenever I add a new file to my TS project, Typescript just gives up on this file. No autoimports, absolute path imports or custom config works on the editor, as if my tsconfig.json file was not being applied to the new file.

All of my co-workers have this issue and it is annoying, as it is necessary to restart TS Server constantly.

I have seen this issue in Typescript, which backports to VSCode which was due to a bad merge on Electron side. But apparently this issue has been resolved for over 6 months. (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33564)

I am just curious if more people are having this issue on Mac
