This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

In android-studio, I used an edit-text to add an item to a listview after a button is clicked.

Is there a way to save the state of the listview-items even after the app is closed?

I want the listview-items not to be erased, and stay as it is even after the app has restarted.
## [8][Licenses Library - Provides license texts of common licenses for easy use in your project](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iodhou/licenses_library_provides_license_texts_of_common/)

Hi,

I finished my second open source Android library (furthermore I'm still a student with not that much time, so please be considerate):

[https://github.com/cyb3rko/android-licenses-library](https://github.com/cyb3rko/android-licenses-library)

You can easily get the most common licenses in formatted and plain text form as Spanned objects.

You can get a license text by just calling  `AndroidLicenses.get(AndroidLicenses.CC_BY_SA_4_0`. For more on the usage you can findd in my repo README.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope my library works as intended and it helps somebody in making their apps.

I would really appreciate feedback!

Some example photos ( Only the shown text belongs to the library, the ui and the app belongs to the sample app):

I am building a finance management app, and want to include automated tracking via SMS. The app is already published on play store, and I'm planning to add the new SMS permissions in the next release and had a couple of questions.

1. How long does the review for permissions take?

2. What should I expect from the review?

3. Do I absolutely need to include a video for the feature? The issue is I'd compromising my PII while demoing the feature on a video.

4. Any other things to keep in mind for the same? 

Will really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance!
## [10][How did Instagram do this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iooiz0/how_did_instagram_do_this/)

I have Rooted phone with Xposed installed. I have xPrivacyLua which controls what fake information will be fed to apps. I have Facebook installed few days back. Today, I installed Instagram. In my xPrivacyLua setting, I only gave access to 'clipboard' for Insta. However, as soon as I opened the instagram, it gave me option to login using my Facebook and also showed names of few of my friends using Instagram.

I know Instagram will obviously have access to my Facebook data. However, how did Instagram know that I have Facebook with my login on my mobile? xPrivacyLua works flawlessly for most of other apps. When I block access to apps, it will block it. Then how did this bypassed it?

Technically, only other way I can think of is to have some special `Intent` which Facebook app can catch and then respond to it. Anyone know what is going on?

&gt;When submitList is called the first time, the adapter  renders all the items, but when submitList is called again with updated  object properties it does not re-render the view which has changed.

Seems it will only respect the change when you add or remove a new element from the array. Check out the Stackoverflow post for more info. Hopefully you won't bang your head against the wall like I did
