* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi,  

I had some free time and I made a simple app that displays current info about Covid cases.  

Maybe someone will find this code useful, every feedback appreciated.  

App is using Kotlin (flow + coroutines), MPAndroidChart, Koin, Navigation and more (complete info in GitHub readme).  

More tests are coming soon :D

## [7][Trying to do an internal test on playstore with email list of testers, just checking this won't inadvertently deploy to production?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fro8tu/trying_to_do_an_internal_test_on_playstore_with/)

So the app is not released yet and I just want my email list of testers to be able to access it.

So far my email testers have not got any email yet, and I'm wondering if I need to click 'release to production' (see screenshot). To 'release to production' means release to the entire world and not to your test group, but in this context maybe that's what google play means? Just checking it's safe to click that button. 2 part screenshot cause I couldn't fit it on 1 page.

Also I have filled out the email list and it is under 'testers' in the below screenshot. Also not sure what the difference is between internal and alpha test or are they the same thing? Think there was a button where 'release to production' is now that I thought was going to email my testers with a link, but it did not. Any advice appreciated. thanks

edit: ok just checked the main application page now and the app is showing as 'pending publication', perhaps my testers will be notified when that goes through? i didnt put much effort into the screenshots, icon cover image etc because this is just a prototype so just want to get it quick and dirty up and running. hopefully playstore will not block it because of that

&amp;#x200B;

edit2: ok thanks to the replies i understand now. i need to wait until it has passed 'pending publication' and then will be able to send off opt-in link to my testers. cheers

I just finished developing an Android app that allows users to find and submit locations where they can obtain emergency essentials. The app is called I See TP, it just hit the store yesterday and is in beta mode. I would love for you to download it and give me your feedback, comments, critiques, bug reports, inquiries, etc.

Items that the app currently tracks are toilet paper, masks, sanitizer, lysol wipes, water, rice, ramen, and milk. This is a live production version so chances are there aren't any locations in your area yet. If you do add a location, please add one that you were at recently. Users are allowed to submit, edit, and report locations without creating an account.

The app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.heinousgames.app.iseetp&amp;hl=en_US.

We also have a website at: https://www.iseetp.com

I've been using Lunacy for a while now and was wondering how you do it for your apps? What's your process of coming up with a good design?

Title pretty much sums it up. Since the Covid-19 outbreak hit the fan in mid-March the only numbers that have changed for any of my apps is the ad CPM. I am getting just absolutely f\*cked. If this continues I doubt I'll even break the $100 payout threshold  in April.

Anyone else having the same experience?

## [12][I added data retention to Firebase UI's FirestorePagingAdapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/frn9i5/i_added_data_retention_to_firebase_uis/)

This is pretty basic for what I need, I'm hoping a better way will be added on 6.3.0:

ViewModel:

    // Use your preffered config
    private val config =
        PagedList.Config.Builder()
            .setEnablePlaceholders(false)
            .setPrefetchDistance(2)
            .setPageSize(2)
            .build()
    // firestoreRepo.getPets() is a Firestore Query
    private val factoryPetShop = FirestoreDataSource.Factory(firestoreRepo.getPets(), Source.DEFAULT)
    val liveDataPetShop = LivePagedListBuilder(factoryPetShop, config).build()

FirestorePagingOptions:

    fun build(data : LiveData&lt;PagedList&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt;&gt;, parser: ClassSnapshotParser&lt;T&gt;): FirestorePagingOptions&lt;T&gt; =
        FirestorePagingOptions(data, parser, DefaultSnapshotDiffCallback(parser), mOwner)

I use the LiveData from my ViewModel to pass it to FirestorePagingOptions.Builder.

This way, the data is still retained upon fragment destroy and FirestorePagingAdapter doesn't have to query for the data again, so I can save my recycler view's scroll position.
