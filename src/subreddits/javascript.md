First off, let's get this out of the way - pretty much any client side code running in the browser can be reverse engineered (as far as I know). What I'm interested in is making it challenging enough that a skilled developer is just better off recreating my work than copying chunks of it.

My motivation by the way, is I have spent about 1 year working on a JS application, which is heavily optimized. Inside it are algorithms I spent a lot of time working out how to run efficiently and they work well... so well in fact it's my "secret sauce" as according to my tests my library is about 4 to 5 times more performant than my competitors.

Ideas I have to help:

1. Simply minify all the JS code... function names and variables names becoming random letters will make it somewhat hard to understand.
2. Re-write the most important parts in Rust, minify the Rust, then compile to WASM. Because WASM is lower level I'm hoping it's harder to reverse engineer. Of course there are WASM decompilers but it seems like if you minify your Rust code before compiling to WASM it makes the decompiled output harder to read.

Are there any approaches, tools or libraries people can recommend to help protect my code as much as possible?
