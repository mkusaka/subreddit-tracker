This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

## [5][How should I approach dynamic strings with parts in strings?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f48cxk/how_should_i_approach_dynamic_strings_with_parts/)

Hello, how should I correctly approach structuring dynamic strings in my xml file? For instance our string consists of 3 parts:&lt;**string name="confirmation\_view\_information\_description\_part\_1\_v2"**\&gt;Please have your&lt;/**string**\&gt;&lt;**string name="confirmation\_view\_information\_dynamic\_part\_2\_v2"**\&gt;dynamic string&lt;/**string**\&gt;&lt;**string name="confirmation\_view\_information\_description\_part\_3\_v2"**\&gt;ready to show&lt;/**string**\&gt;

String named **confirmation\_view\_information\_dynamic\_part\_2\_v2** can have different values. I thought about adding **%1$s** and keeping only a single string. However, that way I found no way to actually **apply different color for that dynamic placeholder**.

Using our current structure, we can apply different colors for our parts using SpannableBuilder.
Also, strings are in the library, which is exposed as SDK. Clients should be able to modify strings easily.

Hi,

after working hard for many months on my first Android App, I released it early February into the Play Store. It was a game called "Instagram Higher Lower", very similar to the Higher Lower game (http://www.higherlowergame.com/) you may know, but with Instagram users. A week after the app was online, Instagram reported it as trademark infringement, so it went down with this reason: "The app uses, without authorization, the trademarks, logos, badges and/or banners of Instagram.". I did not use any logos, badges or banners of Instagram, only the name in the title and the images of persons on Instagram. (Screenshots of the game: https://gyazo.com/082dbcf7be7638b4a322c3f8189692a2)

I wrote an email to the person who commited this, however, I received no response. After I googled some time, I found that the name must have been the problem here. Instead of calling it "Instagram Higher Lower Game" it should be "Higher Lower Game for Instagram". However, I am not to sure.

So Instagram / Facebook is not answering to my response email and I don't know what to do now. I want to re-release the app because I spent so much effort and money into it, but otherwise I don't want to risk my dev account being suspended.

I saw posts here about this years ago - but the Raspberry Pi has come a long way since then.  I was thinking of picking up a RPi 4 4Gb to do Android development on.  If the performance is too garbage, I'll look into something else - but I'm looking if someone has had some actual experience with this.

Does anyone know of a HUD app which would display buttons presses of a physical device (i.e. Xbox controller) over Android / app UI?

Basically I'm aiming to test latency of games / game streaming and would like to register when android system acknowledges a button press and when the app responds.

If something like this doesn't exists, is it even possible with current Android permissions without rooting?

I am creating a parent control in Android Studio which has 2 contents the parent and child. how can i integrate the parent and child phone? For example, restricting the child's phone in searching for unwanted sites with the use of the app that  i will create when the parent phone is using it? 

Because when I search in the internet I can only restrict myself not the other's phone
