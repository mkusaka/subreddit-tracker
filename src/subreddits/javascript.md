I think I heard about this library from Wes Bos on the Syntax podcast recently but I forgot to write down the name.

I googled but cannot find it. I know I can do this myself but the library had a few other interesting features.

Anybody know it?

P.S. it's not jQuery, it is a tiny library that only does a few things.

And on a spectrum between "well, this is only a few lines to replace; it's not so bad" and "there are like, a gajillion lines worth of spaghetti-legacy-production code that depend on this and I literally just have to work around this right now", what was it like?

Edit: what I mean is undefined = value, not variableName = undefined.
