Hi.  I’m looking to build a small web service which is basically mainly a DB + lots of custom business logic. It need to provide an API for integration with different parts of the company. It will also have a small web UI part which is basically a status dashboard, and some minor editing functionality for some of the entities.

It’s been a while since I’ve done anything like full stack webdev work. I was somewhat familiar with rails 3 ... but looking at rails now, it seems to have gotten a lot larger and more complex.

So, what’s your current favorite web framework for “mostly backend” stuff like this?
Sinatra? I’ve had a quick look at Hanami, and it seems to fit, but it also seems to have slowed down its development a lot in the last ~6 months. 
I’m most comfortable in Ruby, and this is also the wrong subreddit to ask ... but if anyone has experience with Python’s flask, I would be happy to hear how it compares.

Some form of data mapper would be nice to have.
It as long as I don’t have to escape the SQL myself, I’m happy.

And if there any tips for matching front end things that work well together, that would be appreciated as well. Although the easiest will probably be to just use a template engine and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

I wrote a super minimal gem to work with SEPA Reason Codes.   


When implementing payments with SEPA, I had a pain point of not finding information regarding reason codes. So, I found and combined them into a gem to make working with them easier.

[This is not strictly Ruby-related, but y'all are my people so I thought you might appreciate this.]

I just threw some notes together about how I'm thinking about my personal site in the JAM stack era. A lot of people seem to be trying out Gatsby or Next.js on their personal blogs, so I thought it would be fun to use techniques from Rails land to improve the performance of my "boring" Jekyll blog so that it feels like a single-page app with minimal JavaScript. Spoiler alert: I'm using Turbolinks.

Next up I'm planning to add purgecss. I'm also looking for a way to bundle a subset of Font Awesome icons via CSS (maybe with an SVG sprite, I guess).

I'm still exploring new optimizations and progressive enhancement techniques--what do you think of this approach?

Hey everyone! Sorry if this kind of post is unwelcome, but I would love your thoughts on the best way to learn and practice Ruby (on Rails) rapidly. I am starting an internship on Monday, and I need to get as good with Ruby as possible before then. I misread an email from my manager last month and I spent the past month learning Java, whereas I am actually going to be using Ruby.

I am very familiar with programming concepts from a number of languages (C, Java, Python, some JavaScript), so I would like to avoid tutorials/documentation like Codecademy that start at the very basics. However, I don't have enough time to do a deep dive like I did with the Oracle Java documentation. Ideally, I can get a grip on the syntax and semantics, and also get some experience actually building in it.

Thank you in advance! I'm an idiot and would be very grateful of any suggestions lol

The default debug terminal in VSCode apparently doesn't let me read from STDIN and I have no idea how to solve this problem. Is there any way I can debug Ruby scripts with breakpoints and all the fancy stuff and be able to read console input?
