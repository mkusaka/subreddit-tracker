We’ll be joined by other developers and team leads from Kotlin, as well as two special guests: Wojtek Kaliciński /u/wkalicinski from Google and Sebastien Deleuze /u/sdeleuze from Spring.

On October 12–15 we hosted the Kotlin 1.4 Online Event, and over the course of those four days we received many interesting questions. Since we did not manage to cover all of them due to time constraints, we will answer them in a specific thread under this post.

Please post your questions as top-level comments to this post.

We look forward to hearing from you!

I know it can be tough sometimes when you dont have anyone to check with for help sometimes and well those who know how tend to not want to help but if we learn together we can help eachother out. Want to join me on the path to learning kotlin let me know.
## [4][Coroutines and exception logging](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/joez53/coroutines_and_exception_logging/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/joez53/coroutines_and_exception_logging/
---
I'm fairly new to Kotlin and I've noticed that exceptions thrown from within a coroutine that aren't also caught inside aren't picked up by my logging framework (Spring Boot + logback) the way they normally are. This means I don't get the additional logging info like log level, timestamp etc, as well as breaking the expected format in my log parser.

Is there a way to solve this universally without explicitly adding exception handlers to each coroutine I launch?

For my thesis work I am working on a study on the respect of accessibility in Android applications.

I need to collect information from Android developers to understand the problems encountered in implementing accessibility guidelines.

I ask you to compile this survey and help me to spread it among your contacts.

Thank you for your cooperation.

I am being heavily ignored in the last days on this forum... but I will give it another try :)

Ok.. I have downloaded Google's Trivial Drive app which should be kinda demo app for learning how to add billing library into your app... But... They made it soooo much (in my opinion) unnecessary complex and complicated...

They focused so much on some layouts and made dozens of micro procedures which makes it very hard to get everything connected in your head... Even just checking if fuel is empty of full tank got sooo much complex...

&amp;#x200B;

And the irony of the life is that in few places they wrote: "To keep simple things simple"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help me with the most simple code for buying 1 month subscription and buying 1 product?

&amp;#x200B;

Please... Just the absolute bare minimum of code in one file... Without using my own server support for tracking sales... and if possible... to be compatible with   Billing library 3.0 :)))

&amp;#x200B;

In short.. I would like this code to do:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You click button \[Subscribe\] and get a Google Play dialog menu to pay for sub

You click button \[Buy fuel\] and get a Google Play dialog menu to pay for product

You click button \[Action button\] and code checks the status of subscription (Active, Expired, Canceled, In grace period, On hold, Paused)

       // Is there a status ---&gt; NEVER BOUGHT SUBSCRIPTION... or something like that?)

And there should be some event... Some trigger where you will get status what happened with requested purchase of product...

override fun OnSomeActivityDontKnowWhichOne(action: Action, string: String)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Ok.. Soo... Visually ...something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    package example.asdf.com.billy
    
    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
    import android.os.Bundle
    import android.widget.Toast
    
    var CarFuel = 0
    
    class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    
    override fun OnSomeActivityDontKnowWhichOne(action: Action, product: String) 
    {
    
        if (action == PURCHASE_PRODUCT_OK) 
        {
            if (product == "car_fuel")
            {
               CarFuel++
               Toast.makeText(applicationContext, 
               "Thank you for your purchase. You have now " + CarFuel.toString() 
               + " unit(s) of fuel", 
               Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            }
        }
    
        if (action == PURCHASE_PRODUCT_NOT_OK
        {
               Toast.makeText(applicationContext,"Purchase failed...", 
               Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
    }
    
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) 
    {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
       setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    
    
    
    
       // Text on button: [Subscribe]
       val BuySub = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.buttonBuyOneMonthSub)
       BuySub.setOnClickListener(View.OnClickListener {
    
       // When you click button [Subscribe] it should appear
       // Google Play dialog for paying for 1 month subscription
    
       RequestBuySubscription()
    
       })
    
    
    
       // Text on button: [Buy fuel]
       val BuyProduct = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.buttonBuyMyCoolProduct)
       BuyProduct.setOnClickListener(View.OnClickListener {
    
       // When you click button [Buy fuel] it should appear
       // Google Play dialog for buying a product
    
       RequestPurchaseProduct(ProductId)
    
       })
    
    
    
       // Text on button: [Action button]
       val MyCoolAction = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.buttonActionButton)
       MyCoolAction.setOnClickListener(View.OnClickListener {
    
       // check if subscription is active...
       // like...
       val Status = GetSubscriptionStatus()
    
       // Status can be Active, Expired, Canceled, In grace period, On hold, Paused
       // Is there a status ---&gt; NEVER BOUGHT SUBSCRIPTION... or something like that?
    
       if (Status == EXPIRED)
       {
          Toast.makeText(applicationContext,
          "Subscription expired. Please click [Subscribe]", 
          Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    
          return@OnClickListener
       }
    
       if (Status == ACTIVE)
       {
          Toast.makeText(applicationContext,
          "Thank you for being our vip user :)", 
          Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
     
          FetchSubStartTime()
          FetchSubExpirationTime()
    
          // It would be good to fetch date of Subscription start and subscription end
          // Preferably if possible to get unix times :)
       }
    
    
     })
    
    
       }
    }
