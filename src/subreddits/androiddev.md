I'm using biometric prompt to authenticate users, the app is always using fingerprint, but I would like my users can choose between Face ID or Fingerprint. How can I get this if it's possible?

I'm just starting to learn Jetpack Compose, so I'm quite inexperienced.  It's a completely different paradigm than the view system, so I guess you need some time to get used to it. But at first glance it seems pretty counterintuitive to me. I mean, to understand what's going on you have to trace all the flow of several composable functions, each one calling another one, sometimes all the way up to the ViewModel, with parameters (state and events) that are not immediately clear.

It seems a big mess, but, as I said, I'm still quite inexperienced.

What do you think?

Hey! I made a bot to track my app reviews in Slack, it has been really handy. Mostly it reminders me to reply to new play store reviews when they come in. but I also set up a slack channel that only populates with my competitors reviews and it has really helped me get a better picture of what my users want, mainly due to the fact I'm getting a high volume of reviews coming in. Even tho the reviews aren't for my app specifically, it helps paint a fuller picture of what my users are looking for, what they hate, and what they love. 

I wrote a longer post on medium if you're interested.
