I come from java and am just confused about constructors in Kotlin. I know a bit about secondary constructor and that they have to call the primary constructor, so my question is, can there be more than one primary constructor in a class and if so, how?

I'm trying to access the DOM by retrieving an element I've defined in my HTML file. However, each time I try and fetch it in Kotlin by using `document.getElementById("someCanvas") as HTMLCanvasElement?` it returns null (or ClassCastException without the optional operator).

Why could this be happening? I can write to the DOM and console, but can't fetch anything from it.

Hello,

I am familiar with Kotlin and Android apps, but what about writing (cross-platform) desktop apps? Is there a Kotlin-first recommended way? Also, is there a tool for visual GUI design you recommend?

Thanks!

I just saw a video on Kotlin Multiplatform and I'm wondering if anyone has used it or shipped anything with it.
