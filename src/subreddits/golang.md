Hello guys,

I just want to share the recruitment logic I faced lately. I'm very disturbed because of the approach and want to get your ideas.

First of all, I have 27 years of experience in development, and in the last 5 years, I'm developing using GO on a professional level. On the other hand, the company is a fin-tech start-up. They want to hire a senior golang engineer.

After our first interview, they sent me a "task" to complete and they said THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. 

I don't understand what is the logic in this. Do you need to hire someone for this position or not? According to this,  I can deliver the task after a month and it should not be a problem, right?

Anyway, I didn't pay a lot of attention to this because I thought that maybe they want to give a comfort zone to a developer and wanted to have the best output for the task.

The task is about developing a GO Client for their Finance service. HOWEVER, after I start the task, it is really containing so many details in it, and developing is taking not 2, 3 hours may be more than a week if I work full-time and pay attention to architecture creation, logic implementation, tests, coverage reports, lint fixing, documentation and the like. And the weird part is they want me to develop a full solution for the countries they support. Not two or three countries.

I have great suspicion to complete the task. The first thing that popped up in my mind is, they just want to push the applicant to give up on their application. Kind of reject strategy. I wrote my thought to HR and they said that "We hired every engineer in the company in this way".  The second thought is they need to have a GO Client for their system and they are gathering all possible solutions from candidates and they will choose the best one from the task deliveries and reject the candidate. I've had many other conspiracy theories in my mind...

In addition to that, should it be the way to test any applicants' golang skills to hire for the position? How many of you have free time to develop a task for a company to be hired? Will you find any time or energy after work to deliver such a detailed task?

I don't know if I should continue or not. Maybe I should deliver the GO client and send the invoice. :) 

What do you think? Is it a scam or not? I'll be very happy to have your thoughts. 

Thanks

[Proto.Actor](https://Proto.Actor) \- Go. [https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go) 

It's a fairly big project, and a decent user base.

But as with all OSS, there needs to be more activity on the maintenance side of things.  
There are community work coming in, PR's and Issues raised.

I'm personally working fulltime on the [Proto.Actor](https://Proto.Actor) dotnet version with clients.

So for anyone seeking an OSS project to help maintain, feel free to reach out.

**What is it?**

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Python,..).

**Motivation**

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.
