I am struggling passing a dynamic BASE_URL to Retrofit at runtime. I found a solution passing the whole API @Url as an argument to the endpoint, but it does not look very good to me. Does anyone have any experience with this?

## [6][Why we switched from Amplitude to Firebase, BigQuery &amp; Google Data Studio for our android app analytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/isjked/why_we_switched_from_amplitude_to_firebase/)

 Hey everyone,

We run a transcription app (VoxRec) which is currently at $2k MRR (doubled last month!)

We use analytics to help make app development choices. At the beginning of the year, we switched from Amplitude to Firebase, BigQuery &amp; Google Data Studio for our app analytics. This is why we did it:

**Cost**

The free tier in Amplitude allows up to 10 million events per month. After that, it’ll cost between 40,000 to 70,000 USD/year!

We calculated that using BigQuery and Google Data Studio, our cost would be about $350/year for the same amount of data!

**Data Ownership**

If we find that we’ve defined some events incorrectly, we can fix data retrospectively. On any other platform, once the data is logged, it's what it is.

**Advanced Analytics**

The features in the Amplitude free tier are limited. We did not have access to the cohorts for example. We were able to recreate these features in BigQuery. For example, we can now look at user retention based on cohorts of country/events/registration status/payment status….

So far, we are very happy with the switch

While creating our reports, we realised that large parts are reusable. We’ve spun it out into a template. You can check out the template [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/359b7631-ed2e-48fa-8d88-38f41ce4343e/page/Gt6KB/?anddev)

If you'd like to get the template (along with set up instructions) let me know in the comments or DM me and I'll hook you up.

## [8][Grid list with LazyColumnFor in Jetpack Compose](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/isi643/grid_list_with_lazycolumnfor_in_jetpack_compose/)

I guess a composable for grid lists like LazyColumnFor or LazyRowFor isn't available (yet).

As a workaround, I'm splitting the list into sublists for each row:

    @Composable
    fun CharactersList(
        items: List&lt;Character&gt; = listOf(),
        cols: Int = 3
    ) {
        val chunkedList = items.chunked(cols)
        LazyColumnFor(items = chunkedList) {
            Row {
                for(character in it) {
                    CharacterItem(character, Modifier.weight(1f))
                }
            }
        }
    }

Can you tell me good approach to theme big projects?

I have "ui kit" gradle module with a lot of custom views. Views and resources from "ui kit" are used in other library/app modules. I want to make "ui kit" styleable — each app should be able to specify its own color scheme for "ui kit", which will then be applied to all ui-kit-dependent modules.

The only solution I know — convert values into attr-references and specify values for them right in app theme of each app. But I see a lot of disadvantages here:

1. I want to customize many of views independently — so there will be hundreds of references without any structural organization
2. I have to add all these hundreds of references right inside each app theme file, or app will crash saying that attr has no value
3. I can't set default value for each reference
4. I can't reuse one color-scheme in different apps — only copy-paste values again and again

What I really need is:

* define all attributes inside something like my color scheme (R.style.MyLibTheme)
* create multiple color-schemes right in "ui kit" module (R.style.MyLibTheme.X, R.style.MyLibTheme.Y, ...)
* in each app theme I add only 1 xml line - color scheme "ui kit" should use (&lt;item name="myLibTheme"&gt;@style/MyLibTheme.Y&lt;/item&gt;)

But I don't know how to do it. If I specify attr value in app theme, I can access it easily in XML via "?myAttrName". If I put attr value inside my custom style, I won't able to access it (I can't call "?myLibTheme/myAttrName". There are a lot of other things I also don't know how to do to implement it

It's clear that LiveData works amazingly with MVVM, but are there any interesting use cases for LiveData with MVP? I'd be interested to know.

Also curious to know if LiveData particularly shines in any other architectural patterns

## [12][How do you improve &amp; optimize upgrade/subscription conversions in your apps?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/is4of1/how_do_you_improve_optimize_upgradesubscription/)

Hey, r/androiddev!

I'm wondering what other devs do to optimize their freemium/subscription service upgrade pages &amp; experiences.

I have an app with a freemium model. I relaunched it recently and with that, I've re-done my freemium upgrade screen. I also made it more obvious through the app as to what features require the premium upgrade.  Conversion has increased slightly, but not as much as I had originally expected.

I'd hope to not completely re-design my experience, but rather A/B test or experiment on different approaches. 

Would love to discuss what you've done to improve your conversions.
