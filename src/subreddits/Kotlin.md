Kord was created as an answer to the frustrations of writing Discord bots with other JVM libraries, which either use thread-blocking code or verbose and scope restrictive reactive systems. We believe an API written from the ground up in Kotlin with coroutines can give you the best of both worlds: The conciseness of imperative code with the concurrency of reactive code.

Aside from coroutines, we also wanted to give the user full access to lower-level APIs. Sometimes you have to do some unconventional things, and we want to allow you to do those in a safe and supported way.

* Discord Gateway

* Discord Rest API

* High-level abstraction and caching

Voice and Multiplatform support coming in future releases.

you can find all the things you need to get started at [GitHub](https://github.com/kordlib/kord) and our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mpDQm5N)

My side project Packrat, built with Kotlin Multiplatform in order to learn a bit about Kotlin is now live in the app store. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/packrat/id1490422067?ls=1. I started with iOS as I knew it better but a lot of my app already works on Android too. Overall I really enjoyed starting to learn Kotlin as a language, at first it seemed similar to Swift (which I love) but as I dived further in I realised this was only superficial, I found it to be it's own unique and productive language with some very cool design choices. 

Using Swift and Kotlin together worked really nicely and I didn't feel any issues with context switching (apart from the occasional fun/func annoyance). I believe Kotlin Multiplatform has a bright future and I hope to use it for a client one day soon.

What is the meaning of this code line? 

 fun  a.b(y: Int) = lazy { u.v(y) }

Hey Guys, 

can you help me understand, what the status and the future of TornadoFX is? On the github page it still says that it is not (yet) compatible with java 9/10. I see that the releases are quite far apart.

Don't get me wrong, i love TornadoFX. I think the way stuff is done is very cool and I have used it in a couple of projects already. 

I am just starting a new project and wanna use TornadoFX with this too, but i need to make sure it is the right lib to use for Kotlin and JavaFX. I just wanna ask if it is still being actively developed, evolving and future proof.

Any comments and hints would be appreciated! :)

I started learning kotlin for Android app development a few weeks ago and I‚Äôm loving it


Published my first android app to the play store using Kotlin. Yes I know it‚Äôs a ***VERY basic app*** However I‚Äôm learning new stuff everyday.

The ***primary focus*** of making this simple app was just to understand the fundamentals of kotlin,  how to use android studio and how to implement ads using admob.

Check it out if you want to see what a terrible app this is lol. The main thing is that I‚Äôm learning anyway.

Hi!

Within Adevinta, we are heavy users of Apache Kafka. We are also Kotlin Lovers! Recently, we open sourced a tool called Zoe that makes interacting with Kafka much easier. This tool is written in Kotlin.

* Checkout [the repository here](https://github.com/adevinta/zoe) where you will find a screen cast that demo the tool.
* And [the documentation](https://adevinta.github.io/zoe/)

Any feedback is welcome : )

## [10][Where to start with kotlin for android dev?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/has3yz/where_to_start_with_kotlin_for_android_dev/)

Hello everyone,

I'm here looking for some advices. Lately I've got interested in GUI and mobile dev, expecially on Android. I started to code in Python for scientific and math usage but now I really got into programming and I wanted to develop a small app for my smartphone. I tried with Python libraries like Kivy and QtPy but it seems I can't get a nice result. It always feels that the app is old or crunchy or not...nice enough.

Recently I've used an app written in Kotlin and It felt like a really good one, runs smooth and was pretty nice to use. 

I thought "I could program for a hundred years in Kivy but I'll never get this result".

So I am willing to move to Kotlin, for now for Android programming at least.

The big problem is I have 0 knoledge about Java, javascript and JVM. I never had to aproach them, because the compilation in Python is done by some libraries called "buildozer", I just had to install JDK and SDK... so now I feel like I have this big black hole in my head with "Java" written on it. 

So now that you know my goal, can you guys suggest me something to start with?

A course, a book or some documentation could be great, but I'd like to know what I am actually doing. For example, I tried to look for the documentation on Intellij IDE website and it's great that they teach you to write "Hello world" and other simple stuff in Kotlin. But I don't know how and from which interpreter the file I've written gets compiled, for example. I'd really like to know what's happening, t have a full vision of the environment (if it's possible of course).

Thanks in advance, guys, thanks a lot!
