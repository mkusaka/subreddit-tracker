* How do I pass data between my Activities?

Hey guys,

Calling all the database enthusiasts for help.

What should be the ideal strategy to store the favourites/bookmarked records..

Let's consider I have Employe table (Id, name, salary), if user selects emp101 as favourite 
Should that be stored as record in Favourites table (storing id of the emp) or we should have a column in emp table it self.

Which strategy is good to get all employees who are marked as fav or not using single query.

I have my own startup, under which I would like to publish Android apps and additionally I would like to publish applications on behalf of another company, as a freelancer. Can I (and how can I) have two Google Android accounts? Should I create two business gmails? Or can I create everything from my personal gmail?

Googled information is controversal. Most often people ask abount account ban, which is not interesting to me

Hi all,

Basically, the title says it all. I find it frustrating reading through interview questions on the internet because I feel like most of them seem to assume you’re applying to FAANG (or similar) companies for some senior role. This frustrates me because I end up feeling inadequate and unprepared reading things like, “You’re going to have to do 7 interviews consisting of phone/in-person/whiteboarding/pair programming” or “I went to X interviews and only got asked these complex algo questions, nothing Android specific”.

For some context I’m a recently graduated CS major from the US without any professional SDev job experience. I’ve only been doing Android Dev for a little over a year with an app on the Play Store and some smaller personal projects, but I feel like I have a solid grasp on almost everything needed to make an Android app (except for more complex libraries like RxJava). My main issue is with algorithmic questions. I cannot for the life of me get good at them even as I spend hours on LeetCode or HackerRank. I can answer simple questions but when things get complex, I struggle to grasp them, which makes me concerned for job interviews where algo questions seem to be favored instead of job specific questions, like Android Development, which I can answer.

So basically, my question is what interview process can I reasonably be expected to go through being new for an entry level Android dev position? What type of questions would I be asked? Could I expect interviewers to "go easy on me" in a sense because it's an entry level position? I would really appreciate answers from entry level Android Devs who’ve gone through this process or interviewers who’ve led the process. I would also appreciate any online resources that accurately describe the Entry level process. Thanks!

My phone is capable of video up to 480fps. But this is only in slowmo mode and doesn't record audio. Has anyone developed an app that will record 120fps video with audio too?

My TV is 120hz so it would be cool to be able to watch 120hz video on that with full audio.
## [9][ConstraintLayout issues in v 2.0.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jb0e6v/constraintlayout_issues_in_v_202/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jb0e6v/constraintlayout_issues_in_v_202/

Is it just me or is anyone else's &lt;include&gt; xml ViewDataBinding with &lt;data&gt; variables is not displaying inside ConstraintLayout after updating to v 2.0.2.

Also Android Studio is not reading the children id's of this same &lt;include&gt; which I guess might have something to do with it not displaying, but this has nothing to do with ConstraintLayout, rather with the IDE latest update.

&amp;#x200B;

After reversing back to previous version of constraintLayout, the IDE is still not able to read the children of the &lt;include&gt; xml but it compiles without problem nonetheless, and the view is able to be drawn again.

Hi,

I was using AlarmManager for scheduled network connections in background and I was using PowerManager.WakeLock before connect internet to wake up device. I changed it to WorkManager. Do I need still PowerManager.WakeLock to wake up device before connect to internet?

It has been a while that I was making an app but I got stuck a lot at the core function so I stopped working on it for months. 

Now, I can't find clear and direct information on how to do this anywhere else, so I hope I get help here. 

All I need in order to finish is simply setup the simple function (in my mind at least) of "battery pecentage (number%) = this_image.png", like "10% = show 10.png, 20% = show 20.png" etc. 

I hope to get assistance here on how to make this work. Thanks.
