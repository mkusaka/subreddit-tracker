Hi, I'm really beginner in React. I'm developing chrome extension right now. I successfully injected App.js as content script. Now I need to implement this feature and I don't know where to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's possible do exactly this in React, when I don't have access to the React Components ?

but I attached¬†**FREE**¬†coupon link above(valid only 3 days).

So, if anyone who wants to learn React,

apply before the coupon expires.

Does react app with CRA include SVG images in bundling?  
Can we avoid those extra browser calls to get those SVGs?  
Read it in my blog:

Hey guys, I am not sure if anyone knows the best practice for doing a theming app using react and redux. The idea is basically like every user logs into the website should have a selected theme. So based on a user's profile setup the website should be structured (using a limited selection of templates) in a way to show the components of the website. Colors,  structure (show and hide some components , show on left or right, top or bottom), any other components from the react app. The user basically selects the desired theme upfront. 

Thanks

Hi

I'm looking for resources to learn React, and Stephens Grider name gets thrown around a lot. He has a lot of courses on Udemy. I usually learn using Wes Bos, but his 2 React courses are apparently out of date.

Who would you recommend to go with?

I am trying out some simple react-course where one task wast to display a random string from an array and be able to assign votes to each of the array entries.

My code kind of works but each vote is delayed as the states seams to update on next render, not directly. What am I doing wrong ? I thought that when using useStates directly It should autorender the page on update.

Hey guys, how do i configurate some linting tool to display warnings (just like the CRA warnings on console ) on a bare react project?  I don't want to use Create-React-App.
