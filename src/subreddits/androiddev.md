Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

I just did an update and users are getting errors that could only make sense if lossy compression was being applied to my asset files.

?  


I've noticed that now it doesn't occur anymore and is [officially fixed by Google](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/142859268#comment3). I've tried on multiple apps on the Play Store. 

So, you don't have to worry about this anymore :)

This has been asked many times before but much of the material that could be found was more than 5 years old so wanted to get latest update on how is the experience publishing on SlideMe and Samsung Stores in particular? Issues of payment and refund, apk integrity (read Amazon changes dev's apk on their own so...), does it affect your publisher status on other stores or any other specific issues.

Also if anybody can relate a positive experience with any other store or make any recommendations they are most welcome.

Thanks in advance.

I'm kinda new to the world of android development. I need help with implementing design library, that would look something like this: 

 implementation '[com.android.support](https://com.android.support):design:28.0.0'. 

this is showing an error. I'm running android studio version 3.5.3.

Do you guys and girls prefer bottom nav or tabs? They're both ergonomic forms of navigation, but bottom nav(for Android at least) doesn't look right because it's stacked on the system navigation. I personally prefer tabs, but so many popular apps use bottom nav. Thoughts?

Hey devs, I'm developing a Museum Gallery app which will play videos and images in VR. These are the problems I'm facing:

1) There are no online tutorial on how to open a images in VR in Android Studio (like if I click on a VR icon, one specific image will open in standard VR mode). How to do this? 

2) I can ask a user to import images. Is it possible to arrange those images in 3D space which can be played in VR? 

I'll be grateful to the dev who will help me.

Thanks for the help.
