Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hq8id7/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

rusty-man ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-man), [lib.rs](https://lib.rs/crates/rusty-man), [source code](https://git.sr.ht/~ireas/rusty-man)) is a command-line viewer for documentation generated by `rustdoc`.  It parses the HTML output of `rustdoc`, searches for a given keyword and formats the documentation similar to a manpage.

To use rusty-man, run `cargo doc` and then call rusty-man with the full or partial name of the item to look up:

    $ cargo doc
    $ rusty-man kuchiki::NodeRef
    $ rusty-man NodeRef

Use the `-s`/`--source` option to load additional documentation, for example the standard library documentation installed by rustup.

Example output:

    $ rusty-man std::io::Error
    std                                     Struct std::io::Error                              rusty-man
    
    SYNOPSIS
          pub struct Error { /* fields omitted */ }
    
    DESCRIPTION
          The error type for I/O operations of the `Read`, `Write`, `Seek`, and associated traits.
    
          Errors mostly originate from the underlying OS, but custom instances of `Error` can be created
          with crafted error messages and a particular value of `ErrorKind`.
    
    METHODS
       impl Error
          new
                `pub fn new&lt;E&gt;(kind: ErrorKind, error: E) -&gt; Error where
                E: Into&lt;Box&lt;dyn Error + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;, `
    
                Creates a new I/O error from a known kind of error as well as an arbitrary error
                payload.
    
                This function is used to generically create I/O errors which do not originate from the
                OS itself. The `error` argument is an arbitrary payload which will be contained in this
                `Error`.
    
                # Examples
    
                use std::io::{Error, ErrorKind};
                // errors can be created from strings
                let custom_error = Error::new(ErrorKind::Other, "oh no!");
                // errors can also be created from other errors
                let custom_error2 = Error::new(ErrorKind::Interrupted, custom_error);Run

## [8][How would one idiomatically simulate "conditions"/"continuable exceptions" in Rust?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hx0reo/how_would_one_idiomatically_simulate/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hx0reo/how_would_one_idiomatically_simulate/

I mean "conditions" as in "continuable exceptions" that some languages have where `raise exn` can actually decide to return a value or not, depending on what the exception handler decides and thus continue at the location that raised the exception in some cases after dealing with the issue.

Rust simulates non-continuable exceptions with `Result`â€”how I normally implement this in languages that lack this ability is to simply have my top level object that constitutes the entire program logic have a `handle_condition` function that is called in such a case that may decide to return or invoke `raise` itself depending on what value it receives; this requires any child objects of said object to to contain a reference to the master object which is normally fine but in Rust it is problematic for an object to contain a reference to its owner.

For an illustration: say I have a master `App` struct that owns a `Conf` struct that contains config data that has a `parse_config_file` method that parses a config file one line at a time. If a single line is malformed I would like to invoke `self.app.handle_condition(condition)?` with the error describing whether the malformed line is continuable or not, if it's continuable it should print a warning or error on some log, but then ignore the malformed line, but serious errors might require aborting of parsing the config file altogether in which case `self.app.handle_condition(condition)` itself will return with `Err`.

This can't easily be done in Rust as `conf` can't easily hold a reference to `app` when `app` is the owner of `conf`.
## [9][Help parsing a really large (2.2GB) JSON file](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hx09kd/help_parsing_a_really_large_22gb_json_file/)

Hey everyone.

I'm currently writing a small program to extract some data from a large source for work, which is running me up against a wall.

The source file is 2.2GB worth of json data, which I need to boil down to something useful for us within the company.
However, due to the size of the file, Linux keeps killing the process before it finishes.

I've tried two different approaches: using `serde_json`, and using `simd-json` for a potential performance boost.

The docs for the simd-json crate isn't all that detailed so I likely did something wrong there (like, I'm not entirely sure why I'm supposed to allow non-simd parsing).

Here's a link to the relevant files for reference: [[link](https://gist.github.com/ElectricCoffee/94b98d78ace85cc5f7f6cca9f80ea826)].

Help would be much appreciated!
