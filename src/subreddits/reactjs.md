We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Do you enjoy endless waves of vaporwave aesthetics? Check out my thing! [https://borzecki.github.io/wave/](https://t.co/u4vN3YC3aV?amp=1)

More seriously, I used perlin noise and three.js to mash together a little demo. Layers of noise can be stacked together with different parameters.

Next.js + SWR codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

It was much easier to implement this realworld project than when using Redux or Mobx.

You can view a live demo and source code on my github below 😄

* Demo: [https://next-realworld-example-app.now.sh](https://next-realworld-example-app.now.sh)

I hope you guys enjoy frontend development with Next.js and SWR.
## [9][React: Sorting Visualizer - Items in array not being sorted properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f5ri30/react_sorting_visualizer_items_in_array_not_being/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f5ri30/react_sorting_visualizer_items_in_array_not_being/
---
I'm making a sorting visualizer in React and have the option of generating a random array or letting the user enter their own 'dataset' to sort. The randomly generated array gets sorted just fine however if the user was to sort their own 'dataset' they input, it never gets sorted properly (largest item in array always seems to get placed somehwere in the middle).

Code:  [https://github.com/kevinniland97/Applied-Project-and-Minor-Dissertation/blob/master/src/components/MainPage.js](https://github.com/kevinniland97/Applied-Project-and-Minor-Dissertation/blob/master/src/components/MainPage.js)

## [11][React app is hosted on GitHub pages. Default branch in GitHub repo is now ‘gh-pages.’ Can I safely change default branch to ‘master?’](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f5qt6j/react_app_is_hosted_on_github_pages_default/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f5qt6j/react_app_is_hosted_on_github_pages_default/
---
Hi all.  I've created a simple local React app, using Create React App.  I have pushed it to GitHub pages, using `npm run deploy`.  As expected, the GitHub repo for this project now has two branches:

    master
    gh-pages

In this GitHub repo, the default branch is `gh-pages`.  Can I safely change it to `master` ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/MoV1v5l)), without anything being affected?  Specifically, I still want to be able to push my local app to GitHub pages.^1

The reason I’d like to change the default branch to `master` is because the `master` branch is the branch that actually displays the code I wrote, as well as the README file for the GitHub repo.  So I'd like to share a link to this repo with collaborators/potential employers, and have my code/README file displayed by default.

Thanks in advance.
___
^1 Whether I continue to do that with `npm run deploy` or some other command.
