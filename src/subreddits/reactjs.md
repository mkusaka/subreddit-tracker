We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I have mostly been a backend developer but decided to learn reactjs, and since then I have absolutely loved this framework. My question is that as a beginner should I learn bootstrap or materialize to style my components.
## [7][A twin-looking clone of Google Keep in ReactJS, GraphQL &amp; Golang with dark theme and more](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fnj541/a_twinlooking_clone_of_google_keep_in_reactjs/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fnj541/a_twinlooking_clone_of_google_keep_in_reactjs/
---
Hello, Recently completed this twin-looking clone of Google Keep written in ReactJS with exact colours, margins, paddings etc. but with reduced feature-set without collaboration, archiving and likes. The UI is built with ***MaterialUI Components*** themed to match Google's *Dark/Light* theme. 

You can create Notes, assign colours, change the theme, attach labels and filter accordingly. Also has a custom login/logout implementation via ***AuthBoss*** library for **Golang**.  It has a real-time update feature, wherein you can create/delete notes in different tabs, the updates are pushed from the server via *GraphQL's Subscriptions.* 

Backend is a ***GraphQL*** server written in ***Golang*** using ***gqlgen***. The user logon &amp; data is persisted in an ***SQLite*** DB file and uses ***GORM*** library. 

**Github Project:** [https://github.com/anselm94/googlekeepclone](https://github.com/anselm94/googlekeepclone)

**Live Demo:** [https://googlekeep-anselm94.herokuapp.com/](https://googlekeep-anselm94.herokuapp.com/)

I've deployed this entire project as a ***Docker*** container in the **Heroku** platform. Because of free-tier limitation, the container will be killed after *30 mins of inactivity*. All the data will be lost, as DB is an SQLite file inside the container.

I have been using Grommet for the last 8 months or so in my first React project.  I have been very happy with it so far but haven't tried anything else yet as this has been a very long first project (React web app is jist one part). What is the general consensus on this sub from those that have tried it? Do other libraries like Material UI offer significantly more?

I'm creating a blog type of application where I do not want to use any cms. I want to be able to log in and then edit things /articles on the website. First thought is firebase. Anything else? I'm looking to build somewhat functionality like with Tina CMS for authorised user.
## [10][is it normal having components with more than 50 props?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fnhnfr/is_it_normal_having_components_with_more_than_50/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fnhnfr/is_it_normal_having_components_with_more_than_50/

I'm working on a CRM for a big hotel brand at my job and we have some components that are massive, they are mostly forms, and every input is a component with some kind of logic, so we have parent components that have more than 50 props in almost every page. I fear it's getting way to complicated and we are doing something wrong.

I know that this is little bit more complicated then it sounds but I just want an advice about which tools will help me make an app that functions this way :

User chooses a case (let's say iPhone).

User uploads a photo / gives a link to a photo.

The photo covers the back of the case that the user chosen.

(Like this :  [https://www.case-custom.com/custom-iphone-xs-case.html](https://www.case-custom.com/custom-iphone-xs-case.html)  )

I want to make a similar web app by my own, which tools would you guys recommend? Thanks!
