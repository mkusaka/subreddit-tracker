Hey /r/reactjs!

It's been about a year and a half now since I posted the original beta of my trip planning app, Tour here. Well, since covid happened I've had the chance to completely rethink the trip planning app and rebuild Tour again from scratch to try to be better than before. (The best part of this was getting rid of all that spaghetti code).

You can get the beta here: [https://tourapp.co/beta](https://tourapp.co/beta) *(on iOS only again, but, I'm going to get it on Android in a couple weeks for real this time)*

Please let me know what you guys think of it!

I recently got my hands on React and for my first project, I made a single page application, that generates test cases that can be used to perform stress testing on your competitive programming solutions. Many of the top coders have said that they use this technique as a last resort to identify any corner cases which they might have forgot to consider.

Hi all, I was trying to implement a boilerplate that also has framer-motion to handle page transitions.  


At the moment wrapping the Switch component with AnimatePresence stops the page to be rendered ( they render only by refreshing) 

Here there's a sample [https://codesandbox.io/s/loving-fire-le5jm?file=/src/router/config.tsx](https://codesandbox.io/s/loving-fire-le5jm?file=/src/router/config.tsx)

&amp;#x200B;

anybody could help me understanding where I'm messing up ?

## [9][Creating a react website without making the APIs public](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hp6jt3/creating_a_react_website_without_making_the_apis/)

I've been building a website called [FinancialSatellite](https://www.financialsatellite.com/) in ReactJS. I chose React because I use it as part of my day job too and the development experience feels so good. Usually I would just use fetch for the API and everything would be fine, but in this case we wanted to protect the APIs so that our hard-worked-for financial data wouldn't get stolen. I'm wondering whether the approach I've taken has some issues.

**How we did it**

Stack: ReactJS, NextJS, Django

Servers: Frontend (public), Backend A (public APIs), Backend B (private APIs)

Private/public refers to whether they are accessible from the internet

By using `&lt;a&gt;` links versus NextJs's link, we can control whether the page is loaded on the client side or server side. We use `getInitialProps` on the pages loaded on the server, and `useEffect` on the client to call the API. The API code will then check `process.browser` to decide whether to fetch from Backend A or B. Fetch is only on the client, so we use fetch from the [isomorphic-unfetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-unfetch) library.

There is a local network connection between the Frontend and Backend B, which is how Backend B can stay private and still be accessible.

**Good points with this approach**

* Able to choose on a page-to-page basis between asynchronous and public vs synchronous and private

**Issues with this approach**

* Extra effort fixing bugs related to accidentally client-side fetching data from Backend B
* NextJs sends the data returned from `getInitialProps` to the client so that you can keep re-rendering in the client. This means there's a chance users could use your API through your website

Please see our website to see how it works, and I can't wait to hear your opinions/criticism of this approach. I have tried to look at other websites providing financial data services, but they don't seem to use React.
## [10][React Developer Tools Chrome extension bug: pause in debugging.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hp52xw/react_developer_tools_chrome_extension_bug_pause/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hp52xw/react_developer_tools_chrome_extension_bug_pause/
---
At first I thought I have activated something by mistake, maybe a keyboard shortcut while in chrome devtools, but the annoying behaviour of pausing in debugging is been caused by a bug in the latest release of the react Developer Tools. You may face this error as well.

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/19308#issuecomment-656682924

The issue was addressed and solved, but the release is still waiting for approval on chrome extension store.
## [11][Hosting S3 vs Netlify/Heroku](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hp8g2h/hosting_s3_vs_netlifyheroku/)

Hey guys,
I'm looking at hosting a create react app and seen that using s3 for hosting is an option. 
I currently have a s3 bucket setup for hosting the applications images and seen that you can also host react apps there. 
I was wondering if anyone had experience of doing this and what the drawbacks would be of using a bucket compared to other hosting platforms like netlify or heroku. 
Thanks
## [12][Help me with weird html rendering issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hp843s/help_me_with_weird_html_rendering_issue/)

I'm trying to render the message with html tags inside it. The rendering is working fine if  the string is passed as prop, but when the same is passed from a variable the display text has encoded text.

Any idea how do I get it working in both scenarios.?
