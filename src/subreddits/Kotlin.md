Hi folks,

In these days of quarantine, I started an open source project. I'd like to share it with you and gently ask, to everyone interested, feedback or critiques.

The project is hosted here: [https://github.com/besil/kobot](https://github.com/besil/kobot).

It is a framework to create conversational bots, using a simple configuration file.

The goal is to help non technical users to create conversational channels in an easy way. I know some proprietary software already do this, but I didn't find any open source project about it.

Main feature include:

* multiple conversational channels: telegram, http, cli, ...
* Database interaction through sql language, in order to send dynamic messages or to store information
* External HTTP API integration, in order to interact with web services
* Published as docker image to simplify devops

Framework is implemented 100% in Kotlin, with Spring Boot integration.

Any critique or feedback is welcome!

Thank you!

Hi
I am going through the Kotlin koans, and i have reached the part where it introduces sequences. In general i understand the concept of sequences, but in the documentation that is linked in the task description, the following section goes straight over my head: 
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sequences.html#from-chunks

What is the point of yield, and yieldAll? And what is it that they try to illustrate with the example? I can get the same printout by making a sequence by generateSequence, with initial value 1 and {it +2}, and calling take(5).
I apologize if this question does not make sense, but i am completely stuck at this point, and i don't want to go further without understanding it.
