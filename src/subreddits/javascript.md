 Hey guys!

A friend and I are starting a web development program - the gist is to basically develop web apps from scratch using the latest tech frameworks. All will be done online and free :)

For the first web app, we've chosen VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.

If interested, you can find out more below

We are gonna cap this to 20-30 people - so subscribe! It's first come, first serve.
