We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello!

I'm stuck, I do not know how to push an array with JavaScript / React, I'm stuck.

I have a server which accepts post requests. With Postman I can make new entries with

```json
{
 "username" : "marios",
 "name" : "John Doe",
 "email": "johndoe@example.com",
 "address": "Somewhere in the World",
 "telephones": [
  {
   "telType": "Home",
   "telNumber": 1234567891
  },
  {
   "telType": "Mobile",
   "telNumber": 2101111111
  }
  ]
 }
```

And my Code in React is 
```react
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default class AddContacts extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.onChangeUsername   = this.onChangeUsername.bind(this);
    this.onChangeName       = this.onChangeName.bind(this);
    this.onChangeEmail      = this.onChangeEmail.bind(this);
    this.onChangeAddress    = this.onChangeAddress.bind(this);
    this.onChangeTelType    = this.onChangeTelType.bind(this);
    this.onChangeTelNumber  = this.onChangeTelNumber.bind(this);
    this.onSubmit           = this.onSubmit.bind(this);

    this.state = {
      users: [],
      username: '',
      name: '',
      email: '',
      address: '',
      telephones: [ ]

        }

How do I get the URL of a page (as displayed in the browser location bar) to change as I scroll down the page? For example, [like on this page](https://stripe.com/docs/api)?

I'd guess it's using the history object behind the scenes, but it's specifically doing it in reaction to the scroll reaching a certain part of the page that I don't know how to do.

(I don't know what keyword to search for. My searches for scrolling find pages about how to scroll from javascript, not how to react to the user scrolling.)

(I'd like to know how to do this from react, but information about how to do it in pure javascript also welcome.)

Hello. Currently I am writing my first react project, it is a quiz website and I stumbled upon a problem I could not find any elegant way to solve.

I have several question types, and so I write a lot of switch cases in my code. I think this should be avoided, because adding new question type would require rewriting almost whole code instead of one file. I tried storing type as string, and storing questions in different arrays. Is there any correct or nicer way to handle this situation? I think about maybe storing functions inside my objects together with components
## [9][How to call useEffect only on mount while satisfying EsLint missing dependencies warning?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ep1ez2/how_to_call_useeffect_only_on_mount_while/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ep1ez2/how_to_call_useeffect_only_on_mount_while/
---
Hi All,

Below is an example of a useEffect with an empty dependency list:

      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        console.log("useEffect called")
        window.addEventListener('keydown', (e) =&gt; {
          if (keyCodes[e.keyCode] === props.pad.key.toLowerCase()) {
            playSound();
          }
        });
      }, []);

If I leave it as-is I seem to get the desired behaviour of useEffect only being called on mount, however, EsLint gives me a `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` and wants me to add the following dependencies: `[playSound, props.pad.key])`.

I've added these dependencies with `playSound` wrapped in useCallback (see below) but doing this causes the `useEffect` to get called every time `props` is updated.

      const playSound = React.useCallback(() =&gt; {
        props.setNowPlaying(props.pad.id)
        const sound = document.getElementById(props.pad.key) 
        sound.onended = () =&gt; {
            props.setNowPlaying("")
            setActive(false);
          };
        setActive(true);
        sound.play();
      }, [props])

I can't inline the `playSound` function into the `useEffect as it's used elsewhere in the component. 

Can anyone provide some guidance on how best to change this code so as to only add the event listeners on mount whilst satisfying the EsLint warnings?

Please let me know if you need more information. Thank you for your time.

Hi guys,

I've been aware of ReasonML and ReasonReact for a while now, but only recently decided to do a deep dive. My impression after a few days using it in my spare time is that it's brilliant, it really makes sense when they say it's ES2030 JavaScript.

My concern is that Facebook is going to let Reason die before it has a chance to really take off. Checking the ReasonML blog there wasn't a single update last year and there were only 3 updates on the ReasonReact blog.

So my question is: is it worth learning Reason in 2020?

As far as the tool itself goes, I would love to invest my time in learning how to use it. However the community seems small and there are next to no jobs advertising ReasonML (at least in London), so I'm a bit hesitant and was hoping someone in the know could shed some light on Reason and where it's heading this year.
