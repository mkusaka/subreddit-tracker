We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

In 2020 itâ€™s time to take videos to the next level! Me and a friend have spent the last year developing this tool which could be of great addition to everyone's web dev  and creativity toolkit. Any feedback deeply appreciated! Thoughts on UI, UX, features and capabilities are all welcome. Here's the URL: [Intelli](https://intelli.tv) 

It was built using React. Ask me anything about it!

Cheers :)

Apologies if this is the wrong sub, but I can't find precisely what I'm looking for in the documentation. Input fields have an onChange event, which is great - What I'm looking for is an event that fires when a user has finished typing in an input field. Is there any such event in React?

I know of reactiflux on discord but it doesn't appear to have a material-ui channel.  Is there one out there?

Sup, Reddit!

I'm learning react for maybe 2 months, but feeling myself not really motivated, cos I'm feeling that I'm using it wrong. For example, how do you handle data from GET queries? I'm reading it window.url and it works like a charm. But I don't think that it's correct.

Like, I'm experienced in django with jinja2 templates, and it's seems easy and straightforward to me. But when talking about react... Webpacks/Babel/redux/etc. I really don't get how to deal with this.

Maybe there is someone interested in free slave? Like, I'm interested to see how the react development looks like. I can do boring stuff or whatever. 

Or maybe someone interested in pair programming? I have an idea for a web application which will be useful for newbies in programming. I can do/teach backend in express/django. 

Or maybe experience exchange? I can guide how to build bots relying on image processing or bots using browser emulator.

Or even maybe there is a tutorial like djangogirls for react? Almost every tutorial I saw leads to finished project which can be running on local machine or custom using 3rd party service, but how do you deal with this in real production workflow?

I'm using next.js and converting it to static html, but how do you handle this without next.js? Running additional server with react on board for frontend?

Please, don't be shy to reply here or in DM.

Fresh out of college, took a good 1 month holiday after graduation and now trying to land a job in the coming months (hopefully by March).

Decided to impress future employer by creating my own web portfolio. 

Here's the link to it [radziramli.com](https://radziramli.com)

Not fully done yet,
- Resume not done yet
- Contact Section unfinished

Need some feedback to it especially for larger screen ie 1440p/4k. I would say I've fully optimized it for mobile and 1080p view. 

Also, for those senior dev, would you hire me just based on the website alone? If not, do give me some tips on the things I could improve on. Thank you!

Made with : Nextjs, Ant Design.
