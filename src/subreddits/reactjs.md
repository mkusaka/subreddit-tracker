We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey fellows,

&amp;#x200B;

üí° I just released a **class-oriented state manager** for **React, NextJS** and **React-Native apps** I've been developing in the past 6 months.

# It is called [Acey](https://github.com/Fantasim/acey).

&amp;#x200B;

Acey allows you to **encapsulate** your **states** inside **Model class**. Then you can gather the methods you need to treat, access, format, and organize their state. üç±

With it you can :

* **Update** and **access** your Model‚Äôs state **wherever** you want **in your App** without any binding. üîì
* Connect conveniently any Model with any component, so they re-render when the Model‚Äôs state changes. üîÑ (Example of a Counter App [here](https://github.com/Fantasim/acey/blob/master/example/reactjs/counter/src/App.tsx)*)*

&amp;#x200B;

It implements many useful built-in features to make your life **easier**, **building**, and **maintaining** your app architecture.

Here is a couple :

* **Local store and cookie** feature: Store your Model's state to **retrieve** their **previous state** when your app reloads. üóÑÔ∏è
* No Provider. üéà
* Model Nesting.
* Collection helpers.
* Compatible with **React, Next, and** **React-Native**. ‚úÖ

&amp;#x200B;

üí≠ If you have **any questions** just let me know here, or feel free to open an issue in the project repo

‚≠ê If you like it or think of using it, feel free to **drop a star on** [**Github**](https://github.com/Fantasim/acey), always good to get some support. :)
## [9][Reacting to a child's prop value.(hooks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/goiay6/reacting_to_a_childs_prop_valuehooks/)

I have a parent component A  and in its first line of return, I have a banner component and followed by it are B and C component. So, A has banner,  B and C as child components and D is the child of C.

There is a submit button in D component and when the user clicks this, I have to show the banner which is located in A.  I've built all these components using hooks.

D component has the most functionality so I placed my button there. I'm stuck at making the banner visible after the user clicks the submit button in D.

Can anyone please throw some light on how can I achieve it.

(I made child components for better readability).

TIA

I build this yesterday and thought it came out pretty well.

In the wake of covid a lot of businesses (restaurants, etc) need to collect information on the customers in order to contact them afterwards if someone around them is ill. This is done by paper a lot of times.

Let's stay with the restaurant example:The customer fills his data out on a landingpage (possibily in advance):[https://qcps.netlify.app/generate](https://qcps.netlify.app/generate)He can now store it as image on his phone.

[https://qcps.netlify.app/](https://qcps.netlify.app/)The business puts in an email and if needed some custom fields.This is stored locally, so whenever it is opened up, they are ready to go.

Now they can scan the qr codes of multiple people, add the information (like table) and send it to the email. The data is now searchable, sortable in the business email account.

I disabled the email part, because I'm not yet sure how to set it up without being vulnurable for spam.But feel free to drop any suggestions.

Feel free to use or comment on the code in any way you like:[https://github.com/groev/qr-code-participation-system](https://github.com/groev/qr-code-participation-system)

I'm not sure if this will get some use anytime soon, but for me it was a good lesson implementing qr codes in an application, which is actually pretty easy because the packages work out of the box
