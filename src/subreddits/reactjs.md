We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [5][Any reason not to cache all my functional components that don't take any props?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gklyyf/any_reason_not_to_cache_all_my_functional/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gklyyf/any_reason_not_to_cache_all_my_functional/
---
I've been noticing that ~60% of my components don't even take any props, and some of them get re-rendered all the time just because their parent re-render. Doing some tests with memoization with a handful of components I can totally see a noticeable difference when profiling the app if I start memoizing those components.

So the question is: is there any reason whatsoever why I shouldn't be wrapping all my functional components that don't take any props with the following wrapper?

```
const memoAlways = component =&gt; React.memo ( component, () =&gt; true );
```

---

Edit: if you think this question is about whether one should memoize all the things please read the question again more carefully. I'm talking about components with no props and a ~0 cost comparator function: `() =&gt; true`.

I was wondering if you should create module / class for handling the API. The class would contain all the api calls etc.  Would this be good approach?

React Route with windos.location.href = external url causes infinity reload and screen flickering on load page.

What I'm doing is that on load of the react page, I'm either returning a the following router under if "user object" is not defined, or the component if the user is logged in.

The code under works fine if I put it on a button and load the whole component, but on load of the page, when it returns this component automatically, it starts reload infinity.

React Route with windos.location.href = external url / port to another app causes infinity reload and screen flickering. in this case config.serverPort is 9000, and my react app is running on port 3000.

    return ( &lt;Router&gt; &lt;Route component={() =&gt; {             window.location.href = `http://localhost:${config.serverPort}/login`; return null; }} /&gt; &lt;/Router&gt;

meanwhile this works:

    return ( &lt;Router&gt; &lt;Route component={() =&gt; {             window.location.href = `http://www.vg.no`; return null; }} /&gt;

Is seems like as long as I have localhost in the url, it causes this infinity reload, even if I set port to the same as the app 3000. This is happening during rendering as I try to redirect the user to oath external login page if iser object is empty instead of rendering the app. Does anyone know how I can fix this?

It is worth to mention that the login service is on another external localhost port, so it is not a part of the react app.
## [9][background perspective effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gkunes/background_perspective_effect/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gkunes/background_perspective_effect/
---
Hi, 

I am trying to implement an effect, that translates the background based on the mouse move. 

I got pretty close, but for some reason, the animation is a bit _laggy_. I thought it has something to do with the `requestAnimationFrame()`, but it did not solve the problem, it's still not smooth, and it seems I am failing to figure out why. 

I have wrapped this example into a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/competent-mclaren-8vrg1?file=/src/components/Background/index.js), if someone could tell me how to fix this, it would be highly appreciated. :) 

Thank you!

Hey react devs! I've been developing this portfolio project for quite a few months and I would like you to check it out and tell me your opinion or any constructive critisism about it. Sadly I do not have the opportunity to create a video showcasing it so more people can see it but i guess it's alright. I truly believe that it's worth looking it up it would mean a lot to me. I've tried my best to make it pop out from the other usual clones so enjoy the app!
