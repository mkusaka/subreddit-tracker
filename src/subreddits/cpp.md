**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

When people try to optimize numerical algorithms, there is a point when the profiler says a significant part of time is spent computing sin, cos, tan, sqrt, etc.

Re-implementing custom versions is often beneficial in term of CPU time (with tremendous gain sometimes !)

In videogames too, people like to implement faster (but less accurate version alas) of these functions.

So why is std::sin not the fastest possible version ? Is it a matter of branch vs branchless like for std::floor (managing temporary value overflowing has a cost) ? Something else ?

I want to make a calculator. Can't decide which one to use. I think ImGui is some kind of lightweight library. Also, are any of these two good for making 2d games? I'm thinking of using SFML for that.

*Hah, I tried to post this a lil earlier and was wondering why nothing was happening, but I had accidentally posted it to my own profile B) so many intellect!!*

Anyway, here I am, hello cool programmers!

4 days ago I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3iae9/preview_of_my_second_library_eseed_window_window/) about a "preview" of my cross platform window library, [ESeed Window (GitHub)](https://github.com/elijaharita/eseed-window). I called it a preview then because, well, it only actually had one platform supported! Anyways, I am quite pleased to announce that after 4 cursed days of learning X11, ESeed Window has graduated from a concept and is **now officially cross-platform for both X11 and Win32!**

The entirety of the ESeed Window interface has been implemented in X11 with the expected behavior, including:

* Dimension / title management
* Fullscreen
* Input management
* Vulkan surface management
* Unicode support

The library has currently been tested in GCC on Ubuntu 18.04 &amp; MSVC for Windows. Other distros will likely need additional testing, and for this, outside contributions would be immensely helpful. In any case, I'm very happy with the progress being made so far.

\---

Here are a few code examples! :)

Plain window creation

    #include &lt;eseed/window/window.hpp&gt;
    
    int main() {
        esd::wnd::Window window("Title", { 1366, 768 });
        
        while (!window.isCloseRequested()) {
            window.waitEvents();
        }
    }

Creating a Vulkan surface is also very simple!

    #include &lt;vulkan/vulkan.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;eseed/window/vulkanwindow.hpp&gt;
    
    int main() {
        esd::wnd::VulkanWindow window("Title" { 1366, 768 });
        
        std::vector&lt;const char*&gt; extensions = 
            window.getRequiredSurfaceInstanceExtensions();
        
        vk::InstanceCreateInfo instanceCreateInfo;
        ...
        instanceCreateInfo.setEnabledExtensionCount((uint32_t)extensions.size());
        instanceCreateInfo.setPpEnabledExtensions(extensions.data());
        ...
        vk::Instance instance = vk::createInstance(instanceCreateInfo);
    
        vk::SurfaceKHR surface = window.createSurface(instance);
    
        ...
    
        while (!window.isCloseRequested()) {
    
            ...
          
            window.poll();
        }
    
        ...
        
        instance.destroySurfaceKHR(surface);
    
        window.close();
    
        instance.destroy();
    }

\---

MacOS is next on the implementation list. I hope to finish it before too long.

As usual, more details can be found on the [Github Page](https://github.com/elijaharita/eseed-window). If you're interested in the project and updates, consider starring and following me on GitHub! More documentation is on the way after the MacOS implementation is complete &lt;3

I think that's all for this time. Hope everyone is well, have a great day!
## [10][C++ Fork?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g72teo/c_fork/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g72teo/c_fork/
---
Let me start by simply saying that I am fairly new to C++ and this is the first time I am posting to this sub-Reddit. I hope I am not breaking any rules here. 

I have a question:

Would it be possible for C++ to be forked into a newer more modern version like the way Python went from version 2.x to 3.x? Maybe clean-up the language a bit, remove some redundant features etc.

Iâ€™m enrolled in a C++ beginners course, however I get stuck in the teachers lecture notes or sometimes it more than what we actually apply and I get sidetracked. Any website/ source good for learning basic code? Iâ€™m stuck on Vectors/Arrays and functions. Any recommendations?
