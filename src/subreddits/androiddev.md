* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Obviously some of you do it for a career but I am still in school so I am still in the hobbyist/learning phase and after finishing my first major app I don't want to work with java or android studio for a while. I am going to take a break and focus on getting better at react in the meantime before starting my next app.

Greetings,

i just recently switched to Android from Windows Phone, and i really, REALLY miss Windows Phone's keyboard. I tried 5-6 different keyboards but there's always something wrong (SiftKey's forced space after punctuation can't be disabled, general lack of navigation keys everywhere, and when they're present they take too much space - see hacker's keyboard).

So, since it's android, i said to myself "why not make my own?".

Problem is my mobile development skill simply doesn't exist. I spend 90% of my time writing in C++ for Windows or Linux, and barely use Java for 3 or 4 university courses that require it, still targeting desktop environments.

When i jump into something new i find it easier to start working after putting my hands in an example project; however, while there's a lot online about normal applications, i found very little about keyboards. Just a step by step guide that focuses mostly on layout, and this [https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/creating-input-method](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/creating-input-method)

but of course it skips on the project setup.

Is there any place when i can find example projects for "system" apps like keyboards, launchers, etcc?

Hi everyone,

My girlfriends phone was stolen 2 days ago, and yesterday was found in front of her door. It is intact and fine but we want to check its location history because we have a theory who could have taken it and want to cobfirm it. 
Location history is turned off, so I wondered if there is an API or other way to access it via adb?
Thank you a lot in advance, hope someone can help.

Hi,

I used AdMob ads for a while now, and never faced an issue. A week ago however I received a notification that my app violates the AdMob policy with the reason "Site Behavior: Navigation". From the description however I cannot tell what is wrong with my app. I already asked for a review twice but it was rejected again. Also, I can't seem to reach any support team from admob to raise the issue...  


Can someone maybe check my app and tell me what is wrong? [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=clipz.streamclipz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=clipz.streamclipz) 

It's a simple [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) clip download app, I am showing a banner at the bottom of the home screen and an interstitial ad after 3 clip downloads from a user. 

Thank you very much in advance!

I see that Button and TextView are, are there any others? How can I know all of them?
