We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi :)

Recently, I've been struggling with setting up i18n with the (Next.js) static export. (Namely the i18next library but did not find any other general solutions.)

What I'd like to achieve?

&amp;#x200B;

* I want to generate *multiple versions* of the app, one "version" per one language.
* I want to handle all the translations at *build time*. (I'd like to output static HTML files translated to different languages and *don't* want to include the translation logic in the bundle which gets shipped to the user)

Has anyone had any success achieving something similar? The closest solution I found is [https://github.com/claudetech/node-static-i18n](https://github.com/claudetech/node-static-i18n), which is unfortunately only for plain HTML (no JSX)...
## [7][redux-toolkit does not allow mutating state in createSlice](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hbd1ay/reduxtoolkit_does_not_allow_mutating_state_in/)

Hi guys. I'm trying to implement redux-toolkit in my React project. In the doc it says that redux-toolkit comes with immer, which allows mutating state. However when I try to do so, here are the errors I'm getting:

\-  `Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot add property x, object is not extensible` 

\-  `Unhandled Rejection (Error): Invariant failed: A state mutation was detected between dispatches, in the path 'myObject.0.aRandomProp'.  This may cause incorrect behavior.`  

Please let me know if you have come across this problem before. If there's no fix for this, I might need to go back to vanilla redux, since redux-toolkit is doing the opposite of making my life easier
