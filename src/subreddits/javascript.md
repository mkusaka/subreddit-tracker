Hi

I'm working on a [side project](https://github.com/customcommander/tagtical) and I'm looking for early feedback:

* Does it look useful?
* Any suggestions?
* Why would you not use it?
* etc.

Anything that can help me improve and grow ;-) Thanks!

### Use case: pluralisation

Depending on the value of `n` you need to produce a different text, e.g. "There is 1 fox", "There are 10 foxes", etc.

A typical implementation would be:

    `There ${n === 1 ? 'is' : 'are'} ${n} ${n === 1 ? 'fox' : 'foxes'}`
    //=&gt; e.g. "There is 1 fox"
    //=&gt; e.g. "There are 10 foxes"

Simple enough yet already difficult for the brain to parse. The code sort of hides the intent, which is a shame IMHO.

How about this?

    pluralize`There is/are ${n} fox(es)`;
    //=&gt; e.g. "There is 1 fox"
    //=&gt; e.g. "There are 10 foxes"

### Use case: default value

Similar concept; you can embed default values to use when their interpolated siblings are empty. The default values are removed from the string when they're not needed:

    defaults`Hi ${username}/guest, you have ${num}/no new emails`;
    //=&gt; e.g. "Hi John, you have 10 new emails"
    //=&gt; e.g. "Hi John, you have no new emails"
    //=&gt; e.g. "Hi guest, you have no new emails"

I heard a lead dev say the callback pattern is dead.  Is that too much of a blanket statement.  
In React adding a callback to a certain setState call can be incredibly useful.

Is there a better non-callback way to do this?

Basically I have a huge array of usernames, and for every element in that array  I send a GET request to an API (redditapi in this case) which in turn recursively calls GET requests until there is no more data to GET (usually this is only about 5-7 recursive requests per user at most). However, about half of those requests fail with an error of "err insufficient resources" which I deem is due to the fact I am absolutely blasting out requests. I have tried using Promise.all to no avail, I have tried adding setTimeouts to delay requests being sent out and all this does is wait until each request is done before it sends the next one. I'd like to do something like send out 5-10 requests, wait for them to succeed or fail and then send the next batch of 10 users. Any help is appreciated.
