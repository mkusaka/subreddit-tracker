I am trying to use some data that will come from my `useSelector()`  
 hook in a network API call. However, with the code below, I get the error `TypeError: cannot read property 'query' of undefined.`

I understand this is because the query has not come back from the `useSelector()`  
 yet. Is there a way I can wait for that data THEN call the API?

`const pageContent = useSelector(getPageContent);`

  
`useEffect(() =&gt; {`  
`axios`  
`.get('https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search', {\`  
`params: {`  
`key: process.env.API_KEY,`  
`part: 'snippet',`  
`type: 'video',`  
`q: pageContent.data.query,`  
`},`  
`})`  
`.then((res) =&gt; res)`  
`.then((data) =&gt; console.log(data));`  
`}, []);`

I saw in a project I am working on a use of useMemo for a small (a potential additional icon) component within a larger component. Is it something you would do? Is it a common?

*tl;dr*: How do I mock firebase(initializeApp, auth, etc) using jest and react-testing-library

I'm creating a form component that uses firebase to authenticate a user, either using email-password or google. I'm trying to test the component but can't mock firebase(don't know how, tbh). Can someone please help me? How do I mock firebase(initializeApp, auth, etc) using jest and react-testing-library?

For example, how do I check if `firebase.initializeApp()` is called by my component on mount, using jest and react-testing-library?

Also, what are some good resources that i can use to learn jest and react-testing-library.

Hello everyone. hope anyone can give me some advice or guide me.

I'm an engineer student and decided to start programming on my own because yes, I got a lot of logic thinking on my career but I was missing a lot of new tech that jobs are looking for to apply.

I have some background with Visual Basic (my first programming language when I was a teenager) , C++, Java and C where I learned the fundamentals about it and now I'm focused with Javascript and React (MERN) / React Native because I love how it works. I have been doing FreeCodeCamp (1800hs done), Udemy, TreeHouse, Scrimba, SoloLearn and even more among free and paid courses but I feel like I need to get my hands on real projects. I have my github (It's growing and I feel very proud of the green dots showing) where I upload my practices and some apps that I made and I try to work everyday because despite all, I enjoy programming.

And here comes my question.. how to get a job where my skills can be used? I mean, I find all job offers looking for Senior developers and if they are for Jr developers, they ask for 2 years of experience and even more... that's crazy.

I'm not giving up because I love to work in the tech field but its kinda frustrating right now.

I am trying to set context on a category react component using the context API, which occurs when a radio button is checked. Whenever I click, nothing is happening. I want the radio button to remember the previously checked item when the component is unmounted. Am i doing something wrong?

The other styles are Checkmark which is a span, and the Container is a label. Thanks in advance.
