What are your thoughts on AppLovin?  


I am looking to implement them in my apps since they seem to be very popular ad network, but some things like lack of ad filters(only mature 17+ and dating ads) and poor website design/UI kind of make me uneasy.  
Also the fact that my apps are mostly set for 13+ and I am not sure if ads they serve would put my app at risk.  


So, do you use AppLovin? How do you make sure that ads served in your app are according to your app rating? How does AppLovin perform for you? Is it comparable to AdMob?

Hi! Happy New Year yall!

I currently working on a small project mostly based around usage of WebView. There is no any architecture or some specific design patterns in my mind, but looks like I'm using a lot of Singletons. The application it self is simply a WebView in an activity and most of the logic is around singleton classes. Also I'm using JavaScriptInterface annotation and "evaluateJavascript" to achieve something like "bridge". The thing that is really bothering me is that the only activity(where WebView is used) is getting really big.

Recently found that GreenRobot EventBus library. I did little research around that concept of EventBus and kinda liked it. It might organize my project a bit. But there are some negative opinions around it. Is there a good reason to not try it?

Currently, we want to test an edge case. When user upgrade Samsung Galaxy S10e, from Android 9 to Android 10, he can no longer launch our app anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

We came across Samsung Remote Test Lab.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for Samsung Galaxy S10e device, we only have 30 minutes test time - [https://i.imgur.com/VwQmmSi.png](https://i.imgur.com/VwQmmSi.png)

&amp;#x200B;

But, in order to test the edge case, we need to perform update from Android 9 to Android 10, within the test device. That will take more than 30 minutes - [https://i.imgur.com/750gBRD.png](https://i.imgur.com/750gBRD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way for us, to request Samsung support, to allow us to use test device more than 30 minutes? We had emailed to rtl.support@samsung.com . But, haven't heard anything back from them yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know a better channel, for us to make such request? Thanks.

Hi guys,

I just want to know your opinion. Here is my case, I need to implement activity that is similar to my existing activity. For this case, do you guys create new activity or just use the existing one?
