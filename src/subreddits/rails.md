I’d like to be able to log any blockers that devs come across in our team, from small annoying things to larger issues.

I’ve had countless times where one of us will encounter an issue that someone else in our team has already found a solution to but it hasn’t been logged anywhere.

Are there any products out there that do this sort of thing?

A social media analytics app will get data from many sources like facebook, twitter, instagram,etc. A user who logs in my analytics app will see the option to connect these 3 social media to periodically fetch from those sources.  


How is that handled via devise? I dont want code I want to understand the flow. My confusion is that I am already logged in then how can I connect those 3 social media? Is that still oauth?

Hi, please excuse me if this is a simple question, but I am new to Docker and AWS, but not to rails.

I want to get my Docker skills better, and I want to get my AWS skills better!  I want to deploy my application using Docker on AWS. I dont know where to start.

I have a rails API only application (created using the API flag), which now has a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file. There are so many Docker tutorials and I understand how Docker works in its basic form - but here is what I don't understand:

1) if the database is created on a separate container, how does the application connect with it, and how do I deploy it on AWS? does it need a separate cluster? Does it need a separate Dockerfile? is docker-compose only used for development, but not for production? 

I don't expect anyone to give me a long explanation, but if you could point me in the right direction of some good learning materials, or give me a brief overview, or tell me I'm barking up the right/wrong tree, that would be great.

Thanks so much

Hey guys... I want to display a pdf (many pages) in a controller view. I want the user to be able to view the pdf without downloading it. The pdf is quite large (15MB) so I'm a little worried that this might affect the performance of the site. Would appreciate some insight on the best way to go about this. Thanks!

Hi fellow devs,

As a developer who recently switched editor to VS Code it was surprisingly painful to me to find the right extensions for Ruby and ERB-files. So after some deep dipping, trial and error, I made a list of [15 useful extensions.](https://medium.com/better-programming/vs-code-extensions-for-ruby-on-rails-developers-917474e03e04?source=email-a42fe51332f1-1599665294777-layerCake.autoLayerCakeWriterNotification-------------------------907c5322_a2c3_4951_9f79_25e7d58979af&amp;sk=2b3afd818f039451ffc972f54c89e30c) It might help you too.

I have API endpoints in my app that currently only service client admin pages where they can see all their customer's data. Their customers see data that is rendered in erb templates that use a separate controller. Now I want to migrate everything to use API endpoints instead, but I'm not sure the best way to handle this from an API design perspective. I want to make sure that there is no way, not even by some dumb mistake, that someone will see data they shouldn't be able to.

Would it be better to make another set of API endpoints just for displaying data to their customers? Some of the functionality between controllers would overlap and create double the work, but I'm not sure how else to handle this.

Hello there,

We are currently using ComfortableMexicanSofa as our CMS to manage static content and our main goal is to put that content creation on the hands of the marketing department. We are having a bad time as they say it's hard to create beautiful content on it and they always compare it with the experience of creating a page on WordPress.

Do you know of any CMS that could be more user friendly?
