Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

https://github.com/DrCpp/DrMock

After almost a year of development, we'd like to share DrMock, a C++ testing/mocking framework that generates the source code of your mock objects at compile time and offers a unique way of configuring mock objects using user-prepared *states*: Calling methods of the mock object changes the states of the object, which in turn determine the return values of the methods. This guarantees a high degree of configurability and allows coding unit tests without prior knowledge of the implementation (state verification), which we think is very useful. See the front-page of the GitHub repository for a demonstration.

DrMock is written in C++ and python3.7. Building DrMock requires CMake and libclang. It can be deployed on macOS or Linux, where its use has been thoroughly tested. Windows support is one of the goals for the next major version.

A guide to building DrMock, along with an extensive tutorial, sample projects and numerous examples are provided. The source code is well-documented, the C++ component is unit-tested, and the python component is tested functionally.

We'd appreciate feedback on code quality and usability, bugs reports, feature requests - whatever comes to mind! If you're using DrMock on any of your projects or wish to contribute, we'd be delighted to hear about it.

Have a great day!

## [7][Is visiting a C++ committee meeting a good idea if you're not a committee member, nor do you have any proposals?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/em88vy/is_visiting_a_c_committee_meeting_a_good_idea_if/)

Next month there will be a committee meeting in Prague, which is close enough for me to think about visiting. According to  [https://isocpp.org/std/meetings-and-participation](https://isocpp.org/std/meetings-and-participation), the meetings are open to the public. I am interested in learning how these events work and would also like to know what discussions around proposals look like. However I'm not sure it's worthwhile for an average Joe to visit events such as these. Could someone advise whether it's a good idea to ask for a few days off to visit a C++ committee meeting? Is it a good idea to visit for a day or two, or does one have to attend the whole event to gain anything from it?

For the last few weeks I have thrown myself in the amazing world of c++ and graphics programming by starting to create a game engine. Using books, online tutorials and stackoverflow I finally did it! I made an engine able to create a most minimalistic 2d game capable of rendering awesome textures and using the the best sound there is, the sound of silence. 

Alright, all jokes aside, I started working on this project as hobby in order to learn c++.  In my professional career I mostly work with c#, Js and SQL creating web applications but I've always had an interest in game development. After many failed game projects using unity or unreal I came to the conclusion that I enjoy **programming** games but not creating all the **art** that was needed for the types of games I had in mind. With that realization I started to develop an interest in the systems behind the scenes and came to the conclusion I should starting to try to create my own engine. 

Now having learned everything from the internet or books I have not been able to get some critique from people with more experience in c++ then me so I am curious what you guys think of it. I have made the repository publicly available with a simple sample project of how the engine could be used, I have also created a template repository for creating games from scratch with the engine. 

Engine repo with sample:  [https://github.com/Ruinerwarrior/Cheetah](https://github.com/Ruinerwarrior/Cheetah) 

Engine template repo:  [https://github.com/Ruinerwarrior/Cheetah\_Template](https://github.com/Ruinerwarrior/Cheetah_Template) 

Being the first time ever I made a c++ project publicly available and also the first time I worked with CMake, let me know if I need to make some changes in order to make it easier to use for people cloning the repo.

For anyone interested in sources I used for information here a small list of the most important ones

* thebennybox  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnlpv-hhcsAtEHKR2y2fW4Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnlpv-hhcsAtEHKR2y2fW4Q) for graphics programming an game engine design

* stackoverflow for all my other questions

Many thanks in advance for any advice you guys can give me!
## [9][Constant global variable naming convention](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/emobr9/constant_global_variable_naming_convention/)

Assume that you are using the "\_" suffix for member variables and lowerCamelCase for enums.

Which would it be in your opinion the best naming convention for constant global variables?

The real question maybe boils down to: does highlighting that something is a constant helps the developer to understand better the code?  if yes, how do you express that in the naming conventions?

Some examples and observations:

static constexpr size\_t MY\_CONSTANT = 42; // Problems with macros?

static constexpr size\_t myConstant\_g = 42; // \_g lets you know it is a global variable, but how do you know it is also constant?

static constexpr size\_t kMyConstant\_g = 42; // both global/constant info in the name, but using a prefix  seems not the best solution when you want to use the IDE to look for something

static constexpr size\_t myConstant\_gk = 42;  // how member variables would be named ? "\_k" doesn't look good, it would have worked if all member variables were using the \_m suffix perhaps (\_mk)

&amp;#x200B;

Any alternative?
