Hello,

A couple of months ago I ported an old Delphi application to the web. It was the standard, classic, Windows desktop application, with windows to enter data, datatables, reports and so. It works, but I think that it's a bit clunky, as it's all server side renderer with Symfony 4 (PHP).

As an enhancement, I wanna port the frontend of this application to Javascript. I'm an experienced developer (more than 20 years programming), but I'm a novice with modern Javascript (I'm sorry, currently I only use jQuery... :P).

I've been doing some Angular and React tutorials, but these tutorials are very simple and easy, so I still don't know which of these frameworks is the more recommended for the kind of application I want to write. Can you help me to choose which framework to use? 

Thank you! :)

## [7][[AskJS] jQuery spaghetti code project refactoring using es6 classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/fltl0b/askjs_jquery_spaghetti_code_project_refactoring/)

Hi!

I'm refactoring a project where there is a file "app.js" that contain all jQuery code used in the project.

I'd like to split all functionality in es6 classes in order to improve the file's organization and clean the code.

I started from a simple accordion functionality that was written in this way:

    $('.accordion__item').click(function () {
 $(this).siblings('.accordion__sub-items').slideToggle();

 if ($(this).siblings('.accordion__sub-items').length &gt; 0) {
     $(this).toggleClass('open');
 }
});

HTML (for simplicity I added only 2Â° levels):

    &lt;ul class="accordion__list"&gt;
        &lt;li class="accordion__elm"&gt;
            &lt;div class="accordion__item"&gt;
                &lt;div class="accordion__item-title"&gt;First Level&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;ul class="accordion__sub-items"&gt;
                &lt;li class="accordion__elm"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="accordion__item"&gt;
                        &lt;div class="accordion__item-title"&gt;Second Level&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

Started from here I created this Accordion class:

    import $ from 'jquery';
    
    class Accordion {
        constructor({ root }) {
            this.root = $(root);
            this.item = this.root.children('.accordion__item');
    
            this.initEvents();
        }
    
        initEvents() {
            this.item.on('click', (ev) =&gt; this._openAccordion(ev.currentTarget));
        }
    
        _openAccordion(item) {
            const sub_items = $(item).siblings('.accordion__sub-items');
            sub_items.slideToggle();
    
            if (sub_items.length &gt; 0) {
                $(item).toggleClass('open');
            }
        }
    }
    
    export default Accordion;

and edited the app.js file in this way:

    import Accordion from './modules/Accordion';
    
    $(document).ready(() =&gt; {
        const AccordionElm = new Accordion({ root: '.accordion__elm' });
    });

Everything works well but I would ask you if my approach is correct  or could be improved. When an accordion\_\_item is clicked  I pass to \_openAccordion method the ev.currentTarget is this correct?
