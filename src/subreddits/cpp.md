Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

## [2][[Question] What are convincing (preferably perf-unrelated) ways to argue against passing everything by shared_ptr?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hv45lw/question_what_are_convincing_preferably/)

Since C++11, I noticed that programmers in some circles started using `std::shared_ptr` for everything (possibly type-aliasing it as e.g.`Ptr`) and passing everything by `shared_ptr` copy, but this makes me personally uneasy due to the loss in visibility into RAII-based resource release times.

Unfortunately, I'm not good at coming up with the kind of concrete arguments that truly speak to people, so to say, so here I am.

Most notably, I'm having a hard time conveying why destruction times are Importantâ„¢, and why you don't want your object relationships to turn into a strongly connected graph.

What's your guys' take? How would you (amiably) approach the issue?

Obligatory compiler explorer: [https://godbolt.org/z/bcaxGs](https://godbolt.org/z/bcaxGs)

Ran into this today when I realized that my nice helpful static assertion messages were being turned into absolute garbage by Clang. Google yielded [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46376309/why-arent-newlines-other-control-sequences-printed-with-static-assert) quoting this excerpt from the standard:

&gt;the resulting diagnostic message (4.1) shall include the text of the string-literal, if one is supplied, except that characters not in the basic source character set (5.3) are not required to appear in the diagnostic message.

I ended up getting around it by offering a simpler version of my error messages on clang, which is... 'fine', but it almost defies understanding that the standard isn't stricter about it to begin with. Does anyone know the historical context behind this, or if there's any existing moves to clear it up? The current discrepancy between the way the messages are rendered significantly hinders the usefulness of allowing messages in static assertions to begin with, imo.

Hi.

After a resume review by a fellow engineer, I was told that I should build some advanced C and C++ projects to show my competency.  Although my long term goal is to become a sensor fusion engineer, now I am just looking for entry-level positions.  The industry I want to get into is self-drivig cars/robotics/autonomy development.  What are some advanced C and C++ based projects that I can build along the lines of this industry?  These projects are also going to help me learn the languages a lot better as well.

I apologize if this is a dumb post. I figured that this is a good place to ask.

Thanks.

Hello,

I'm more of a Javascript developer but I've been getting deep into C++ the past few months. My goal is to be an audio developer. Can anyone suggest any good projects to build or good resources? I have built a synthesizer simulator on the keyboard but trying to think of others that are in a way easy to tackle.
