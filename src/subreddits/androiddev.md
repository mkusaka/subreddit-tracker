Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi folks, I was wondering if anyone knew of any benefits of RxJava over Kotlin Coroutines. I've spent most of my time learning RxJava but as time goes on I see most people making the switch to coroutines. I know RxJava still has some operators (like debounce) that are missing on coroutines but it seems like that gap will eventually be closed. 

I've also read that coroutines are faster and more efficient, and most people believe they are easier to learn. Anyone know what the pros are for RxJava (vs coroutines)?

I'm a rookie to Android Studio and the layout design editor has been giving me endless problems, I feel like I'm missing something. I usually always drag items from the Pallete to the design editor, sometimes the editor freezes, sometimes everything gets stuck to the top left corner - even when using layouts like relative and linear and disabling the autoconnection to parent option, many times the position of the items doesn't match that on my phone when I test run despite the default view Nexus 5 being similar to my phone's screen size. 

I feel like I'm just banging my head against the wall, is there something I should be doing differently?  Should I stop using the design editor and do everything through XML? Should I never use nested layouts?
