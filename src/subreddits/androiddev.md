This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I have a paid app on PlayStore, the app has checks if the user has bought the app, if not I close it immediately.

I was wondering what you guys do when you detect that your app is cracked, like increasing the text size by each day, making buttons fade by each day, I don't know, share your ideas

TL;DR chances are there are songs on SoundCloud that infringe some record labels' copyright. I was using SoundCloud API in my apps, thus my apps infringe their copyright. The consequence is my Google Play developer account has been terminated, forever.

This is a lesson I paid with a high price. About 2 years ago, I published 6 music streaming apps. These apps relied on SoundCloud API for searching, filtering &amp; streaming music. The monetization model is Admob banner, there is no in-app purchase, no subscription. It went fine at that time. 

Finally, an Indian record label filled DCMA reports about my apps' infringement. They listed some of the songs apparently being uploaded on SoundCloud, without their authorization. My apps were using SoundCloud API, thus, their songs appeared in these apps if my users search for them. 
In the wee hours of a night, I received consecutive emails notify that my apps have been removed for its violations. In the morning, when I wake up, an email put an end to my developer account, for repeatedly violating Google Play policies. Of course, all of my other apps, whether or not they violated the store's policy, have been removed too.

With API Terms of Use, SoundCloud already clarified they do not grant any rights when using their User Content. It was my thoughtless actions that resulted in the termination. 
I was always careful to choose free Google fonts, free Freepiks' icons, free Unsplash photos, free Youtube Studio music, etc. with their appropriated attributions. But I never thought using SoundCloud API would be a big problem. 
My hard-learned lesson.

**TL;DR** Looking for some constructive feedback and open source contributions.

I just published my first app on PlayStore. Designed it as a simple and fun to play COVID-19 pandemic themed Android game as a means to spread some much-needed awareness regarding social distancing norms and use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

I have kept the V1 minimal in terms of features. And would really appreciate if the community could help me build it. In terms of ideas, constructive feedback, open source contributions or simply best practices.

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.project.dodgecorona)
[GitHub](https://github.com/Ashish-Kenjale/DodgeCorona)

The game is FREE and I do not intend to monetize it.

Iâ€™ve made a couple of simple 2D games over the past couple of years using Construct3. Im now looking at moving on to create something in Unity.

Can anyone point me towards some decent beginner tutorials?

Also, what build services will I need for Android and iOS? Construct took care of all that, is that something that Unity also does or will I need a third party?

And voxel generators - are there any free packages out there?

Cheers all :)

I've been working on a tool to reduce the size of VectorDrawables for a little while now. It's built from the ground-up in Kotlin. It supports most of the VectorDrawable spec, has early support for SVG, and early support for converting between different vector art formats.

I hope it improves over time and can help people be more productive. Issues are welcome!

## [11][LiveData on ArrayList, it is not the right choose, but which is the right one ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hd4012/livedata_on_arraylist_it_is_not_the_right_choose/)

Hi,

update the liveData every time an element of an ArrayList is edited is soo tricky, and for that I'm wondering if it is the right choice.  
It never happens to you to have a simple list like this:  

    data Test(val flagTest:Boolean, val name:String, val age:Int)  
    val testsList:ArrayList&lt;Test&gt;

and you have to update the view every time a flagTEst field value change ?
## [12][Where do you store temporary data of your app ? Ram or on db?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hd3ald/where_do_you_store_temporary_data_of_your_app_ram/)

Hi !

I'm wondering where do  you save the temporary data of your app. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example:

a configuration screen storing data on db after click on save button. Before the save button pression where do you store the data ? Do you create a temporary entity on db ??

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have an entity for every screen of your app ???

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I save those datas in memory inside a cacheDataSource, but I don't know if it is the right choice.
