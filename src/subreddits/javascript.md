Hello everybody,

I've setup a monorepo with Lerna and Yarn. I started from some existing repositories and merged them in one. But the AngularJS component is the one with a different publish routine.

I adapted the build script to have a `build` script everywhere but the publish in angular is made from the dist folder of the library.

You can see [here](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles/tree/dev) (the Lerna structure is only in `dev` branch for now) the repository, `core` is the common library, `wrappers` the various frameworks packages (including the angular one), `plugins` are some plugins projects but they are under development and just plain javascript.

How can I make the angular project work fine with Lerna?

I have inherited a JavaScript project that is scanned weekly for known security vulnerabilities (a cross-reference of alerts to NPM modules, etc.). I've managed to eliminate the majority of the problems that were present when I took over the project, but I still have a small number of vulns in downstream dependencies. I'm wondering how others address these sorts of issues? In a few of the earlier cases, I was able to completely drop the module that was the source of the issue (or at least replace it with something else that was more secure). But now that I'm down to the last handful, I'm running into the limits of my knowledge/understanding of the overall JavaScript ecosystem.

Any suggestions/tips welcomed.
