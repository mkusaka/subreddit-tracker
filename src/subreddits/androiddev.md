This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

What benefits Kotlin Native will bring to Android ecosystem, any chance to remove Java?

My app got rejected as it's not compliant with Google Play Policies. That's fine, but I would like to know exactly what is wrong with it so I can address it. Instead, this is what I get:

&amp;#x200B;

...a very generic email that tells me nothing. How difficult is for them to write the **exact** reason(s)?

I have filed an appeal and hopefully a real person will have a look into it.

I'm using a viewpager to show videos using ExoPlayer, which I have one fragment which is creating multiple instances for every swipe and data, on swipe of that it should ideally play the one which is currently visible but that's not happening.

The previous fragment video is not stopping. How to handle this?

Currently I have my personal Google account with a possibility to publish on the Google Play.

1. Can I convert it to a business account without creating a new Google account?
2. The other scenario: if I create a merchant account on the top of my personal account, will I be able to convert it to a business one with previously and personally created merchant account?
## [10][org.threeten.bp.LocalDateTime and java.time.LocalDateTime from 3rd party lib?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g42hf0/orgthreetenbplocaldatetime_and/)

I'm developing an Android app using a 3rd party library which uses LocalDataTime. I'm want to support API 23 so I'm using ThreeTenABP but the library isn't. Any suggestions about how to deal with that?

Full disclosure: I'm also the author of the 3rd part library. But changing that would require making changes in other places too. So I'd rather not do that.

One solution would be to use unix timestamps for dates in transit... But I thought we were past that. Anyway, how are you guys dealing with it?

I have an app idea that I want to pursue getting developed. I already have an outline of its functions and have even gotten an interactive mock-up created of it. I'm looking for a person or company who would be willing to help me continue this process in creating a beta version.

I work in the construction industry and although the money is relatively good, the job is very stressful, keeps me up at night, the hours are ridiculous and it just doesn't fit well with my character.  I've always loved tech and wanted to work in IT and this COVID lockdown was the perfect opportunity for me to invest all this free time into seriously working to make the move.  I've been using all my free time to study Java in the hopes I can eventually make a few apps that will provide a good income or even manage a complete career change.

It's been three weeks and I'm going through the MOOC course, I've bought a few courses on Udemy, the Head First book (although I'm yet to open that) and have been using youtube extensively.  I'm obviously still a beginner but I'm a bit concerned if this is all a bit futile.  

Is a few months enough to get your head around Java or do you need a few years to actually be proficient enough to make money from this (either with getting a job as a Java developer or making a half decent app)?  Does anyone know if developing Android apps actually do provide an income that will pay the bills - what's ad revenue like?  Any middle-aged men make a late career change into Java and it paid off?

I'm sorry if this post is not allowed.
