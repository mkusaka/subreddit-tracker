Hi,

I would like to use PostgreSQL in my project. Could you recommend form or query builder to use?

I used Gorm and pure pg driver but I don't know which is the best nowadays.

Thanks.

Hello everyone, I started using GO about 2 weeks ago and I want to take it to the next level. anybody knows of courses or books that can help me with that? If not, can you recommend some advanced topics that I can self-study to up my game?

Thanks in advance!

There is a use case where we need some way to distribute configuration across machines in distributed system i.e. when a configuration at one machine changes it gets changed  across all machines as well.

I am planning to use [etcd](https://etcd.io/) (which is a distributed KV store) but not sure about the approach. Any suggestion or guidance will be very helpful.

Thanks!

Edit: Also is there any approach to let the service running to know in near real-time that something has changed and it need to re-configure?

I have a yaml file whose contents keep changing. I want to fetch a component from it which is called data.   
existingData = fetchedFile\["data"\]  
existingData is of type map\[string\]interface{} now. I want to range over this, how can I do so?

What are some apps or tools you wish that were written in Go and the reason?

Here is my list: 

* AWX ([https://github.com/ansible/awx](https://github.com/ansible/awx)). A great tool but too many damn dependencies and slow. I need a beefy server to run it.
* Python Pandas. I like using it for my data analysis but I always need Python w/Pandas. Don't care too much about speed but the dependency convenience. 
* VIM. I hate getting plugins and getting a recent vim on distributions is tough. I know there is micro but it doesn't support vim bindings
* Kafka. Don't like Java dependency but not a big deal.  Great tool.

Mostly for me it dependencies and performance.
