Hi. I will hire someone in the future do a "lead quote calculator" for my website. The problem is i have no idea where to start, what to ask for, even how complex a feature like this is. 

The thing i want is on this website - [https://www.sveasolar.se](https://www.sveasolar.se/) . First you write an adress, than you size your roof, choose rooftype, slope, panels you want and last you got a rough estimate and a contact us form. I am a beginner so i wonder are there stuff out there that can do this? should i hire or how do i go about to have a thing like this on my website?
