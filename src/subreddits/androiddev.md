This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [3][[OPEN-SOURCE] Safe Dot - iOS 14 privacy in Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jabro9/opensource_safe_dot_ios_14_privacy_in_android/)

I've recently built an app that mimics the iOS 14's privacy feature which alerts the user when third-party app uses your device camera or microphone.

Link to Google Play : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aravi.dot

So, the thing is I'm not really good at programming yet. I can build things and make them work but I can't make them efficient and 100% bug free. So I need help from you guys. 

I've made the source code open-source feel free to contribute to the app even it can be a translation to your language it really is helpful.

Here is the link to the repo : https://github.com/kamaravichow/safe-dot-android

If you have any suggestions or found bugs in the app feel free to use issues section in the repo or the comments of this post. I'll be happy to respond ðŸ˜ƒ.

I have heard many developers say that it is very difficult to get downloads on the Google Play store. Especially when people are downloading less apps and keeping fewer apps on their devices, how has the struggle been for new developers?

I am curious to know this because I am currently developing an app and want to be aware of all of this. I would love to hear thoughts from other Android developers! Thank you for all those who respond!

## [6][Animating photos using OpenGL ES](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jacvar/animating_photos_using_opengl_es/)

I made an app which uses OpenGL ES fragment shaders and PyTorch foreground object segmentation to create live photo filters.

This is my first project working with the GPU.

Some interesting tech details:

\-The color matching when using live background is achieved by exporting color lookup tables (LUTs) from photoshop and applying them by a custom fragment shader.

\-The foreground object segmentation model is U2Net

\-Some shaders are from Shadertoy (pretty large collection of fragment shaders)

## [7][Has anyone figured out the secure implementation of HostNameVerifier ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jackpy/has_anyone_figured_out_the_secure_implementation/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jackpy/has_anyone_figured_out_the_secure_implementation/

This is my current implementation:

`private HostnameVerifier getHostnameVerifier(final URL url) {`

`return new HostnameVerifier() {`

`public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {`

`String host_name = "examplesomething.com"`

`if(url.getHost().equals(host_name) &amp;&amp; session.getPeerHost().equals(host_name)){`

`return true;`

`}else{`

`return false;`

`}`

`}`

`};`

&amp;#x200B;

Even the official google support page [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7188426) gives the same advice:

If you are using the [HostnameVerifier](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html) interface, change the implementation of the [verify](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html#verify(java.lang.String,%20javax.net.ssl.SSLSession)) method to return false whenever the hostname of the server does not meet your expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

Even then i still get insecure implementation of HostnameVerifier Error. Any ideas why? Thank you

I'm looking to visualize my Android component library, and have used a solution called [Storybook JS](https://storybook.js.org/) in the past for Javascript component libraries. Is there a similar solution for Android? Specifically Kotlin.

A few months ago an organization invited me into their account to deploy an App, I logged in and created some of the info for the App, images etc. 

Today I logged back into my console account and cant find how to get back into the other shared account, would I receive any notification if I get removed or access expires?

On the top right profile/dropdown thing there is "manage dev accounts" but they only lead to a screen to select my own gmail accounts.
