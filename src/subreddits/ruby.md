Are there any examples of creating an interactive shell in Ruby? I'm wanting to create somethig like a command prompt, only I want to build it from the ground up so I can learn along the way. I've been searching for hours and finding only tutorials on the IRB, which is not what I'm after. 

I had started, however I lost all my code, books marks, etc, little as there was. Good oppurtunity to start fresh.

Hello guys.

I have some scripts that are working normally in Ubuntu machines. But when I try to run them in a certain Windows machine the script just goes bananas.

The line that hangs is this

browser.input(:value =&gt; "Εκτύπωση").click and in the irb is showing up like thisbrowser.input(:value =&gt; "

It seems that any Greek character i place in irb it breaks everything.

Thanks

When i type any Greek Character in IRB i get  
\[process exited with code 1\]

I have installed Ruby 2.7.0 from snap, when I try to `gem install pg`, gem gives me this:
```
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (ArgumentError)
    "@\x01\x00\x00@\x01" is not an octal string
```

What cloud it be?

I dont even know the existence of ArgumentError until now


Edit:
Added `gem "pg"` to a gem file, even thought that didn't installed the bind, the command that bundler give me (`gem install pg -v '1.2.2' --source 'https://rubygems.org/`) didn't raised that exception anymore but still it cant build native extensions

It is difficult for me to get understandings of OOP, as it could give big opportunities in learning programming language especially java/C#. I sought many books and courses and unfortunately failed in it, I know java's basic syntax. Yesterday I found book on amazon "Practical Object Oriented Programming on Ruby" it has many good recommendations, especially about explaining OOD concenpts. So the Ruby is pretty eassy language I'm planning to learn its syntax, so it would be easier to understand whole thing. What do you think about that? Is there anyone Who switched from Ruby to c#/java was it worth that?
