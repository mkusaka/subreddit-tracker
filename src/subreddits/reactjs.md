So I got my first job as a react developer and after I checked out the code that they use, I noticed that they use Redux as a state management. To be honest, I've tried to watch several videos about it and I can't seem to understand it. I've never used redux and im going to start the job in a few days and I don't know what to do. (I've already told them that I don't know redux during the interview) 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?
