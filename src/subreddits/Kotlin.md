Hi, I'm on the volunteer team for one of the top 20 projects in the German government's Wir Vs Virus Hackathon. We (nexd) are developing a platform to coordinate grocery shopping helpers for all those who cannot leave the house at the moment. The twist here is that even people without a smartphone and technical knowledge can submit their shopping list via a simple phone call. This way, we reach the people most affected by the crisis: seniors.

We are about to launch the beta test but are in dire need of Kotlin developers. If you are interested in helping (our slack is in English) please contact mail@nexd.app More information about the project (German only, sadly): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PmuLrq4Hno

Thank you and stay healthy!

I'm going through the Android Kotlin Fundamentals course ( [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-kotlin-fundamentals/)) and they are using Googles sampled Sunflower app to teach changing app icon a stuff like that. I've already run multiple android apps like hello world and dice roller projects that I started from scratch. But the sunflower code that I downloaded wont run for some reason and I can't figure out what I'm missing.  


I can't get it to run in the Android Studio either. I appreciate any help!
## [8][Question about nullable generics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/g2e4mh/question_about_nullable_generics/)

Let's say I have a class with a single type parameter, T.

In this class, I can use T? when I want a value of type T to be nullable.

But T could already be a nullable type. 

My question is, how do I do the opposite, i.e. safely represent that a member function that returns type T is NOT nullable even if T happens to be nullable?

Or if that is confusing let me phrase it in another way: given intended construction like MyClass&lt;MyType?&gt;(), how could I write a function inside MyClass that returns a (MyType) instead of a (MyType?)

Thanks for your help
