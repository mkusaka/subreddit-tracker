Alex and I have worked for years with large scale distributed systems from ad serving to cloud databases. During the lockdown we spent time chatting about our favourite topics and thought it might make for a good Podcast. So presenting "The Computing Podcast". 

[https://anchor.fm/computing](https://anchor.fm/computing)

This might seem a bit off-topic but I posted it here since I'm a big fan of GO and now primarily work with systems built with GO and so I will be inviting a lot of people building GO infra to talk with us. Please reach out if you'd like to join one of our chats and tell us about your work with GO infra. Or just subscribe for when we get those GO interviews out.

We currently have 3 episodes and scheduled a bunch more including interviews with folks working on building all kind of interesting distributed systems.

1. **Fourth Wave of Distributed Systems - NoSQL to NewSQL**
2. **Part 1: Apache Kafka - Walkthrough of a distributed system**

I was just doing a little refactor where I noticed I can simplify my method signature so I want to share this tip with you as well. I didn't know it a year ago when I wrote the original code.  


If you have a function signature with multiple arguments of the same type, you don't have to repeat yourself and write the type of every argument.

Stack overflow survey 2020 is out , And its not surprising that GO has jumped 4 positions to be 5th most loved language as compared to previous year

Anything past the first interface slide in a tour of go, I suddenly have no idea what I am reading. I have no idea what I am reading. I know that interfaces are a set of method signatures, and as far as I understand, when a function accepts an interface as an argument, it accepts any object\* that has implemented the methods defined in the interface. 

\* I think that's what they're called? I mean to say structs, float64 that have the methods, etc.

Anything past that, like "Interfaces are implemented implicitly", and "Interface values", I don't understand. I thought all interfaces were a collection of methods, how come they are mentioned as a tuple in this page?

Hi, I made a static analysis tool that can help you find if statements that make your code hard to read.
