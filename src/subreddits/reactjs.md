Hi üëã,

My friend and I are both senior web developers and we came up with a tool to help developers grow in their career. This is our first time giving back to the dev community so we're pretty excited about it !

Our goal is to give advice and resources to devs at specific milestones in their careers to help them progress. For now we have targeted recent graduates and junior devs that are looking for a job or just started one. It's often hard to put words on what you're looking for as a junior dev, so we're trying to build a list of milestones and goals you can follow.

We're still in beta so not everything is perfect and we'd love to have your feedback to know if it's worth pursuing and growing. We have a lot of ideas for new features and milestones, but we want some feedback before we go all in.

Here‚Äôs the link:¬†[https://pathify.dev](http://pathify.dev/)

TL;DR: We‚Äôve built an online platform to help young devs that is currently in beta and we would love to have your feedback: [https://pathify.dev](http://pathify.dev/)

I am comfortable in building applications with React.js, hooks, and redux as well but I want to dive deep into react to become good developer. I have good knowledge how JavaScript works under the hood, and everything related to JavaScript like closures, hoisting, prototypal inheritance,etc. So can someone suggest some resources to learn React.js also upto that level?

What I want to do is to avoid code duplication managing the response from the request that has been made and serving the output to the components.

In this case, as soon as the page is loaded useEffect is triggered. It makes the request and handles the response using setLoadedPlaces to set the data to searchedPlace and setMarker to set the data to markersMap.

But if the user makes a new request, data is treated in the same way as with the useEffect function, the only difference is that the request is made with POST with a body attached.   

I thought that make only one request would be sufficient but how?   
Is it an efficient way?

      const [searchedPlaces, setLoadedPlaces] = useState();
      const [MarkersMap, setMarkersMap] = useState();

useEffect()

    
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const fetchPlaces = async () =&gt; {
          try {
            const responseData = await sendRequest(
              "http://localhost:5000/api/search"
            );
            setLoadedPlaces(responseData.elements);
            let locations = [];
            responseData.elements.map(element =&gt; {
            element.location.lat = parseFloat(element.location.lat);
            element.location.lng = parseFloat(element.location.lng);
              locations.push(element.location);
              return locations;
            });
            setMarkersMap(locations);
          } catch (err) {}
        };
        fetchPlaces();
      }, [sendRequest]);

receivedInputs()

      const SearchSubmitHandler = async event =&gt; {
        event.preventDefault();
        try {
          let responseData = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/search?", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
              address: formState.inputs.address.value.toLowerCase(),
              price: formState.inputs.price.value.toLowerCase(),
              leaseTime: formState.inputs.leaseTime.value.toLowerCase()
            })
          });
    
          let fetchPlaces = await responseData.json();
          setLoadedPlaces(fetchPlaces.elements);
          let locations = [];
          fetchPlaces.elements.map(element =&gt; {
            element.location.lat = parseFloat(element.location.lat);
            element.location.lng = parseFloat(element.location.lng);
            locations.push(element.location);
            return locations;
          });
    
          setMarkersMap(locations);
    
        } catch (err) {
          console.log(err);
        }

## [10][Cards Application: Reduce the opacity of all the other cards which are not selected](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ffb2os/cards_application_reduce_the_opacity_of_all_the/)

Hi,   
I am making a web application where you have cards and you can favorite your cards. All the favorite cards are displayed on the top while the unfavorited ones keep moving to the bottom. When you select one card (not press on the favorite button but click on the card), then all the other card's opacity should reduce to 0.1. Is there a useRef solution?

`import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';`  
`const App = () =&gt; {`  
 `const [hash, setHash] = useState({`  
`catsdata: [`  
  `{ id: 1, text: 'A', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 2, text: 'B', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 3, text: 'C', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 4, text: 'D', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 5, text: 'E', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 6, text: 'F', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 7, text: 'G', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 8, text: 'H', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 9, text: 'I', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 10, text: 'J', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 11, text: 'K', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 12, text: 'L', favorite: false, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 13, text: 'M', favorite: true, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 14, text: 'N', favorite: true, opacity: 1 },`  
  `{ id: 15, text: 'O', favorite: true, opacity: 1 },`  
`],`  
`showFav: false,`  
  `});`  
 `var notFavData = [],`  
`favData = [];`  
  `useEffect(() =&gt; {`  
`notFavData = hash.catsdata.filter((d) =&gt; !d.favorite);`  
`favData = hash.catsdata.filter((d) =&gt; d.favorite);`  
`setHash({ ...hash, catsdata: [...favData, ...notFavData] });`  
  `}, []);`  
 `return (`  
`&lt;div&gt;`  
`{hash.catsdata.map((d, i) =&gt; {`

`&lt;div key={d.id} style={{ backgroundColor: d.favorite ? '#da7878' : '#f5f699' }}&gt;`

`//This is the click handler where we need to write code for the part where when you`   
`// click on any part of the card, all the other cards, their opacity should get`

`}}&gt;`  
`&lt;h1&gt;{d.id}&lt;/h1&gt;`  
`&lt;p&gt;{d.text}&lt;/p&gt;`  
`&lt;button`  
`onClick={() =&gt; {`  
 `//This is the click handler when someone clicks on the favorite button...all the cards which are //favorite are displayed on the top`  
 `const restD = hash.catsdata.filter((el) =&gt; el.id !== d.id);`  
`d.favorite`  
`? setHash({ ...hash, catsdata: [...restD, { ...d, favorite: !d.favorite }] })`  
`: setHash({ ...hash, catsdata: [{ ...d, favorite: !d.favorite }, ...restD] });`  
`}}&gt;{\`favorite ${d.favorite}\`}&lt;/button&gt;`  
`&lt;/div&gt;`  
`&lt;/div&gt;`  
`);`  
`})}`  
`&lt;/div&gt;`  
  `);`  
`}`  
`export default App;`

Redux is a state management paradigm based on Facebook‚Äôs Flux architecture.

Redux provides a structure for large state trees and allows you to decouple user

interaction in your app from state changes.

I have a simple todo list code.

This is the code for smart component  - 

`import React from "react";`  
`import ListItem from "../containers/ListItem";`  
`let list = [];`  
`function Lists() {`  
`list = [`  
`{id: 0, title: 'study', completed: true},`  
 `{id: 1, title: 'study', completed: false},`  
 `{id: 2, title: 'finish react', completed: false}`  
`];`  
`let todos = list.map(((item) =&gt; &lt;ListItem item={item} changeTodoStatus={changeTodoStatus}/&gt;));`  
`return &lt;div&gt;`  
`&lt;h3&gt;Welcome To TODO Lists&lt;/h3&gt;`  
`&lt;h4&gt;Your List Items Are&lt;/h4&gt;`  
`&lt;ul&gt;{todos}&lt;/ul&gt;`  
`&lt;/div&gt;`  
`}`  


`function AddTodo() {`  


`}`  


`const changeTodoStatus = function ChangeTodoStatus(id) {`  
 `console.log('called', id);`  
`let todo = list.filter((item) =&gt; item.id === id)[0];`  
 `console.log('todo', todo);`  
`if (todo) todo.completed = ! todo.completed;`  
 `console.log('after todo', todo)`  
`};`  
`export default Lists`

&amp;#x200B;

This is the code for container component - 

&amp;#x200B;

`import React from "react";`  
`import './style.css'`  
`function ListItem(props) {`  
 `return &lt;li className={props.item.completed ? 'completed' : ''}&gt;`  
`&lt;button onClick={props.changeTodoStatus.bind(this, props.item.id)}&gt;Change Status&lt;/button&gt;`  
 `{props.item.title}`  
 `&lt;/li&gt;`  
`}`  


`export default ListItem`

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is how to update the prop and re-render after button click ?

Thanks in advance :)
