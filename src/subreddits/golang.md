Hi Gophers

I'm a Go and reddit noob (this is my first post), so please be gentle.

I'd like to share with you my latest project: [treedrawer](https://github.com/m1gwings/treedrawer)

It is a simple Go module that can draw trees with several layers and several children for each node on the terminal. It can handle nodes with any type that satisfies the NodeValue interface, so you can have trees with integers, strings or custom types.

I started this project just for the sake of learning. I am currently studying "The Go Programming Language" and, in order to solve an exercise that required to implement the String() method on a tree, I ended up creating this.

I think that my code is far from "Good Golang code", so I'd like your feedback to discover my mistakes and improve. I also believe that maybe someone could find this module useful, but I'm not that sure.

Thanks in advance.

Hey everyone.

I started to learn Go and as a demo project tried to run 'whatismyip' service on Azure Go Functions. Results:
