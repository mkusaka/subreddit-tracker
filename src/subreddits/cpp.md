**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

Recently I remembered a moment from my uni years when immediately after handing in the assignment of implementing our own string data structure we were warned not to ever try to implement and use our own data structures. Which is exactly what you want to hear after working hours on such assignment. However the reason behind it makes sense, you would be only reinventing the wheel and let's be honest, it will be also way slower than data structures in the almighty std library. Now think about it, what kind of black magic is behind the std's speed? Well I had no idea so I took a peak, lets see the code:

    inline string
    secret_function(int __val)
    {
        const bool __neg = __val &lt; 0;
        const unsigned __uval = __neg ? (unsigned)~__val + 1u : __val;
        const auto __len = __detail::__to_chars_len(__uval);
        string __str(__neg + __len, '-');
        __detail::__to_chars_10_impl(&amp;__str[__neg], __len, __uval);
        return __str;
    }

Hey, I bet you just skipped the whole code part. I know it looks unreadable, but please try to go through it and guess which std function it might be (obviously its not called secret\_function, but i'm pretty sure you used this function at some point).

It's only 6 line function but it took me a while to figure out what each line does and I believe this could be fixed very easily just by naming the variables and functions with a bit more descriptive names. Just to prove the point here is an example of how I would structure this function:

    inline string secretFunction(int value) {
        const bool isNegative = value &lt; 0;
        const unsigned absoluteValue = Helper::abs(value);
        const auto length = Helper::charCount(absoluteValue);
        string stringValue(isNegative + length, '-');
        Helper::insertIntAsChars(&amp;stringValue[isNegative], length, absoluteValue, 10);
        return stringValue;
    }

While the functionality stays exactly the same, I think this chunk of code is much more pleasant to read and it's pretty obvious what the code is doing on each line. From this you should have a solid guess which function it is (you can leave a comment), but the real question is why would anyone write such code? Especially when nowadays everyone is talking about how code readability is so important. Is this how they wrote code back when std was released and they didn't bother to change it? Or am I just too inexperienced that I couldn't figure it out immediately?

EDIT: Thanks for the insightful comments, for anyone reading this the reason variables are beginning with `__` is macros. If user defines isNegative macro, it will get overwritten in the std, however user is forbidden to define macros starting with `__` , as the wise people of reddit comment section suggested. However underscores aren't the only issue with this code, the main issue is I think using short non-descriptive names of variables/functions which is very confusing in functions that are doing more complicated operations.

**Link:** [sfy](https://github.com/muqsitnawaz/sfy)

**Motivation:** I was working on another project when I realized there had been many times when I wanted to simply convert the contents of a containers e.g `std::vector`, `std::map` etc to `std::string` for some quick dirty debugging or inspection. Usually, I'd write a \_range-based\_ for loop, but it gets ugly for nested types e.g `std::map&lt;T, std::pair&lt;std::vector&lt;U&gt;, std::tuple&lt;Ts...&gt;&gt;&gt;` etc.

I had also been playing around with C++20's concepts recently, and I really liked how much simpler template meta-programming became if you used them (here's a great [document](https://www.stroustrup.com/good_concepts.pdf) that everyone should read). So I went ahead today and wrote a tiny library for stringi-fying objects i.e for converting to `std::string`; it has `fmtlib` dependency but switching to `std::format` when it comes out. 

The library is in very early stages, please be patient if you come across bugs. Any suggestions and/or ideas for improvements are welcome! Thank you!

## [8][Why is stack-unwinding with noexcept not specified/consistent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h0y7t5/why_is_stackunwinding_with_noexcept_not/)

The following code has on each major compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC) different runtime behaviors:

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    struct A {
        ~A() {
            std::cerr &lt;&lt; "destructor" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }
    };
    
    int get2() {
        A a;
        throw 1;
    }
    
    int get() noexcept {
        A a;
        return get2();
    }
    
    int main() {
        return get();
    }

GCC:  *destructor, terminate -* [*https://godbolt.org/z/WcfnwP*](https://godbolt.org/z/WcfnwP)

Clang:  *destructor destructor, terminate -* [*https://godbolt.org/z/WcfnwP*](https://godbolt.org/z/WcfnwP)

MSVC: *terminate -* [*https://rextester.com/HLKWE55155*](https://rextester.com/HLKWE55155)

In my opinion, MSVC is right to not unwind the stack/calling destructors at all. It is the same behavior then without any noexcept functions at all.

Please don't answer with: The standard does not know about the stack.
