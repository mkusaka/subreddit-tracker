Hey guys I've been trying to figure out how to use ruby on VSCode for 2 hours on windows and I have no idea. I have Ruby, ruby extension pack, and vscode ruby extensions installed. I made a test.rb file and wrote some code but theres no run option when i right click. If I click run - start debugging on the top all I dont see any code executed.  It says Node.js (preview) in the top right. I dont know what that means?

Please help! What do I do?

## [6][sequel-activerecord_connection now fully supports Sequel's transaction API](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/hx0pzd/sequelactiverecord_connection_now_fully_supports/)

A while ago I created the [sequel-activerecord_connection](https://github.com/janko/sequel-activerecord_connection) gem, which allows you to use [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) alongside ActiveRecord and reuse the same database connection. This makes it easier to try Sequel out or to use libraries that depend on Sequel (e.g. [Rodauth](https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth/)) in ActiveRecord-based projects.

Originally the transaction support was partially implemented, where the most common Sequel transaction options were emulated with the ActiveRecord API. In the latest version I've [rewritten the transaction code](https://github.com/janko/sequel-activerecord_connection/pull/8) to fully support Sequel's transaction API.

    require "sequel"

    DB = Sequel.postgres(test: false) # avoid creating a database connection
    DB.extension :activerecord_connection # use ActiveRecord's database connection

    DB.transaction(isolation: :serializable) do # handles isolation levels
      DB.after_commit { ... } # runs after transaction commits
      DB.transaction(savepoint: true) do # creates a savepoint
        DB.after_rollback { ... } # runs after savepoint rolls back
      end
      DB.in_transaction? #=&gt; true
    end

Supporting Sequel's transaction/savepoint hooks was especially important for me, because it's a very useful feature when implementing business logic, and it's something ActiveRecord doesn't really support (AR supports transactional _model callbacks_, which are tied to model's lifecycle and aren't usable when I want to keep my business logic away from AR callbacks).

So, I've installed Ruby and rails and gems and all that awhile back. I had a directory of Jekyll themes I had been trying, and they worked. Now, when I try to run them I keep getting errors about not having a .bundle directory and other errors. I am trying to figure out what to do, and right now I am trying to figure HOW I installed it all in the first place. Can anyone tell me how I can figure out HOW I installed ruby and rails and whatnot please? For example, how can I tell if I used rbenv, or rmv, or the System, or brew, etc. ? Then, I just want to nuke it all and start over (again, for the 1000th time). Thank you!

So like the title says, in school we need to create a cli app using active record and at least 3 classes and tables. Any ideas for such a simple thing? Iâ€™m not trying to re create the wheel but something that can easily be done in a week. I have some ideas already but I am interested what others have to say! 

Thanks!!
