## [2][Need help with AWS Cognito, S3, IAM, STS confusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fsy7g7/need_help_with_aws_cognito_s3_iam_sts_confusion/)

I'm using AWS Cognito User Pool for authentication to my Ruby on Rails app. I've also created an Identity Pool for the User Pool, with the intention that logged in users are able to read files from a specific S3 bucket. However, I'm having trouble access objects in S3 as the logged in user. I have the tokens for the logged in user (`id_token`, `access_token`), but I don't know where to supply them.

Following the [sample code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/s3-example-get-bucket-item.html) from the Ruby SDK doc only allows me to access S3 as a shared user, not the logged in user:
```ruby
s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region: aws_region)
obj = s3.bucket('my-bucket').object('my-item')
obj.get(response_target: './my-code/my-item.txt')
```

Then I found [this doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AuthUsingTempSessionTokenRuby.html) about using temporary credentials, but I also don't know how use the user's tokens anywhere. I've also tried STS' [AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html) that allows me to pass in the `id_token`, and used the Identity Pool's `role_arn`, but I'm getting `AccessDenied` error. I'm confused of the relationship between STS, IAM, and Cognito Identity Pool. Can anyone help?

Note: I've also enabled S3 access logging and it should log the Cognito user who access the files.

I want to know if there is possible to check if a method that is generated by metaprogramming in rails can be viewed as a normal method definition. 

Suppose in the meta-programming definition I have defined a few methods which have a few conditional statements and for a particular such method, I want to see the finally constructed method.
## [4][How to issolate all the bits and pieces of a scraper to run more independently?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fsxq97/how_to_issolate_all_the_bits_and_pieces_of_a/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fsxq97/how_to_issolate_all_the_bits_and_pieces_of_a/

Im building a scraper and using sidekiq for the scrape job. Per product a user can activate a scraper and the scraper called using in a cron job:

Sidekiq::Cron::Job.create(name: "StartScraper - every 2 hours!" , cron: '0 \*/2 \* \* \*', class: 'StartScraper')

\---------

Before starting the scraper i have this in my code (to only scrape the activated products)

product = Product.where('scraper\_active = true')

everything is working fine if the scraper **doesnt brake.** 

But the issue im facing is; **whenever the scraper fails**, the **sidekiq job is starting all over again**. This is bad because if a user is tracking 20 products, and the 19the product is failing, **it will rerun** and start with product 1 again - assuming all 19 products are active.

If i get 10 users, all tracking 20 products, it will go and rerun all the scrapers.

&amp;#x200B;

Im storing the scraped data in a Tracker modal, with these fields

`create_table "trackers", force: :cascade do |t|`

`t.integer "qty"`

`t.string "price"`

`t.bigint "product_id", null: false`

`t.datetime "created_at", precision: 6, null: false`

`t.datetime "updated_at", precision: 6, null: false`

`t.integer "user_id"`

`t.string "current_seller"`

`t.boolean "success", default: false`

I have created a Tracker before starting the scrape job to track if the scraper is failing

tracker = Tracker.new

Tracker.create!(id:tracker, qty:1, price:1, product\_id: product.id, user\_id:product.user\_id, current\_seller: nil, success: false )

and setting the tracker.succes to true when finishing the scrape job succesfully

`current_tracker = Tracker.last`

`current_tracker.update_attribute(:price, price)`

`current_tracker.update_attribute(:qty, current_stock)`

`current_tracker.update_attribute(:success, true)`

`current_tracker.update_attribute(:current_seller, current_seller)`

Everything is one big file. I have thought about splitting everything up in smaller jobs, but then still Sidekiq is performing the job in start\_scraper.rb and will re run everything whenever something is failling.

My ideal solution would be to issolate all the pieces of the scraper in multiple jobs, and to call the next job if the current job is finished succesfully. But cant figure out how.

My question is, 

* what is a better approach to isolate everything and make the scraper more secure?
* How to issolate a job in Sidekiq and move to the next one if success, and retry only the ones that failed?

Im almost building this thing for 2 months. Started learning rails a few months a go and like it a lot.

Want to test the application out yourself (not the code, but the frontend)? See below...

I considered my application finished untill I noticed this behaviour :D 

You can sign up here and test the application your self [http://pnnq.hatchboxapp.com/](http://pnnq.hatchboxapp.com/)  the application is only interesting for dutch people because it scrapes one of the biggest ecommerce sites in NL. 

a free user can only scrape 1 product and will have 3 alerts
## [5]['rails new' throwing Sqlite3 error](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fsw2ju/rails_new_throwing_sqlite3_error/)

I'm setting up Ruby and Rails on a new dev machine--running Linux Mint--and I've successfully installed Ruby, ruby-dev, Rails, and Sqlite with the package manager. (I think Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 4.2.10.) However, every time I try to run "rails new", it gets as far as "bundle install --local" and then throws the following error:

    run  bundle install --local
    Could not find gem 'sqlite3' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile.
    run  bundle exec spring binstub --all
    bundler: command not found: spring
    Install missing gem executables with `bundle install`

I am, however, certain that I've installed Sqlite. I tried "gem install sqlite3", but that fails on the grounds that I don't have Ruby development tools installed--but I do. Everything I've been able to find online so far advises adding stuff to my Gemfile--but my Gemfile doesn't exist yet since it's the command that creates the Gemfile that's failing! So I'm now massively confused ...

I've used Rails before but it's been a while, and I'm not super familiar with Linux, so please assume I need maximum handholding when answering--apologies for that!

I need some social relations such as liking, following etc. In my app, I'm wondering if there is any gem which provides that functionality and is actively maintained at now. Acts-as-follower looks great but it's abandoned so I'm looking for alternative befor I will start coding it on my own

Hey everyone! I am working on a Rails application that requires a digital signature. Many of our clients have opted to use Topaz pads. This works great when everyone is around to share the machine. However, due to COVID-19, this isn't really possible. Our workaround has been signing via mouse and JSignature (I think thats is what its called) but this is quite clunky. Does someone have an alternative to this? Maybe via a mobile app (signing via touchscreen and finger seems nicer than mouse/trackpad). Thanks in advanced and stay healthy.
## [8][Rails and Bootstrap styling on checkboxes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fsm7gl/rails_and_bootstrap_styling_on_checkboxes/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fsm7gl/rails_and_bootstrap_styling_on_checkboxes/
---
I'm building a form in Rails views and have several checkboxes created with \`collection\_check\_boxes\`. 

This is working but looks terrible since there are 51 checkboxes. I would like to space them out but having a lot of difficulty with the usual Bootstrap stylings using components wrapped around the collection and within and both. I've tried \`grid\`, \`flex\` and others. I've even tried to do custom CSS Grid but nothing really works. I would like 5 rows of 10 checkboxes nicely spaced out. How do I get in there and manipulate the checkboxes? In my approaches, it's not that the boxes aren't moving, it's just that they either go into a long row or 1 or 2 columns. Here's the line: 

      &lt;div class="what bootstrap goes here ??"&gt;
    
        &lt;%= f.collection_check_boxes(:authorization_ids, Authorization.all, :id, :auth_name, { checked: @account.try { |a| a.authorization_ids.map(&amp;:to_param) } }, multiple: true, class: "&lt;What bootstrap goes here??") %&gt;
    
        &lt;/div&gt;

wasn't too clear, simple question. is the `|t|` just representative in the table and then in the do/end block we reference it with like `t.integer :games, null: false` ?
