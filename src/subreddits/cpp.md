**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Backwards compatibility is great because it helps ease the adoption of technology be it hardware or software, but it can potentially leads to solutions with degraded efficiency, unnecessary complexity, poorer security implications and much more. As a example, read Intel's x64 design docs which had to use rather complex components merely because of providing backwards compatibility.

C++ had to be backwards compatible with C in order to ease adoption (among other possible reasons), but many realized that changes had to be made such as introducing smart pointers, abandoning C-style arrays, and going functional with ranges, just to name a few. Change is good, in-fact it's great! The problem however is that unless you're up-to-date with the latest best-practice guidelines usually given out by the other more-experienced community members, it can be significantly easier to shoot yourself in the foot. Even though compilers and a handful of other techniques/tools (such as static analysis, ASAN) do an amazing job at helping you to avoid common pitfalls (e.g detecting possible memory corruptions) and to follow best-practices, yet it's hard to train programmers to always write safe code, and even harder to integrate these into large-scale build pipelines. This is exactly why Rust, which is aimed at being safer (e.g by built-in memory sanitization) and (almost) as fast at C++, was developed. No wonder why Microsoft released a statement saying, "Rust is the Industry's 'Best Chance' at safe systems", and increasingly we see more teams choosing to use Rust for their new projects as opposed to C++.

Now, I've played around with Rust and it seems promising in terms of performance and safety, however (don't take my word for it) it could be missing some cool C++-like features/abstractions e.g static reflection, ranges etc. Additionally, C++ has a huge community which is growing everyday and a lot of people are doing groundbreaking research in order to introduce cool features to the language such as dynamic reflection, executors etc. Of course, these features can be implemented in one form or another in other programmer languages like Rust, but languages can differ 1) in terms of performance for an implementation of the same abstraction (e.g C++ templates with concepts could be faster than Rust generics?) 2) grammar (which can make implementation of some language features easier/harder) 3) syntax (e.g Rust tries too hard not to mimic C-family syntax). Given this and perhaps other reasons, some programmer might still prefer to use C++ for its cool new features which are coming out every 3 years (big thanks to all the researchers and implementers behind it!).

I think some people will agree that C++ code can be just as fast as C and in some even cases even faster, thanks to a great set of low-to-zero cost abstractions and the incredibly-smart compilers (with their RVOs etc) for generating optimized machine code. I feel like there's a need for a C++ compiler made just for (post-)modern C++ without any regard for backwards-compatibility which would strictly implement some of the fundamental best-practices, such as, making all variables `const` unless they don't have to be, forbidding uninitialized variables or even forcing you to abandon raw pointers, while offering built-in memory sanitization at compile times among other things. This is just an initial suggestion for desired features, but if we explore, I'm sure there are other undesirable, unsafe things that language permits yet we would not like to see them in our codes anymore. I think that a modern C++ compiler which would outright reject *horrible, unsafe C++98 code* (which is what most recent college graduates write because their professors taught them C++98) seems invaluable, and, maybe a step in the right direction towards building safer and faster systems!

P.S This is just a thought, so I would love to hear what people here think!
## [6][Charset transcoding and string formatting with strf.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hkkqw9/charset_transcoding_and_string_formatting_with/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hkkqw9/charset_transcoding_and_string_formatting_with/
---
Strf is a formatting library that provides a convenient way for converting one character encoding to another.

It allows you to choose whether the presence of nonconformant surrogate codepoints is allowed ( sometimes we want to allow them ).

The documentation is not complete — particularly on how to extend the library, which I may change — but I think there is enough material for one to have a pretty good idea:

* [Overview](https://robhz786.github.io/strf/v0.12.0/introduction.html)
* [Charset transcoding](https://robhz786.github.io/strf/v0.11.1/quick_reference.html#character_encoding)
* [Repository](https://github.com/robhz786/strf)

Maybe someone can spot any design flaw or suggest any worthy breaking change before I release version 1.0. 

Best Regards

Hi,

I have the opportunity to introduce a documentation platform for a project I’m involved on. The documentation is for a large C/C++ code base. I’ve never been responsible for externally facing documentation for developers, so I’m hoping to get some opinions and insight. Has anyone used a documentation, platform, format, etc that they would recommend? I’m aware of Doxygen and have used it in the past, but have mixed feelings about how useful those documents tend to be and it’s impact on the readability of header files. Maybe I’ve never configured Doxygen enough, though. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated! :)

For those who want a to use a tuple as a key, with a variable number of types, to an unordered map, I've made a tutorial on how to implement it in under twenty lines using C++17 Features. Let me know what you think.

I've recently had to move from gcc to msvc, and got a very strange error message. It seems the compiler is interpreting the lambda body as an initializer list being passed to the lambda constructor? Anyway, gcc and clang have absolutely no problem compiling this code, no warnings occur even with all the warning flags provided. Are there some obscure rules about nesting lambdas I'm not aware of? I'd be grateful if someone could take a look, I'm honestly stumped.

I am genuinely curious to why ‘Accelerated C++’ book is considered a good book. Could people who truly used it to get into C++ comment?

I am trying to find a complete, easy to digest and memorable reference to learn C++. When I reviewed AC++ I found it dated, using long examples that are hard to remember. 
On the other hand, I looked at ‘C++ Crash Course’ and found it much easier to digest, short examples and updated. Although it doesn’t get much love on this sub.  

I am just trying to find what is the criteria used when deciding a good, easy and complete C++ book to start with.
