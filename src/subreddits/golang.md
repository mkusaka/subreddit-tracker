I recently learned ruby and what helped a lot was finding ruby gems for simple projects so I can get a feel for syntax, project structure, coding conventions, etc...

What are some of your favorite small (and simple) packages you'd recommend to a newbie? 

I tried looking at [google/go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) which is a wrapper for the github API. Is "straightforward" but the project is huge so it's tough to wrap my head around it and read the whole thing.

Thanks!

I'm trying to get my org to invest in an automation engineer or team of engineers. I suggested python at first, but since I'm learning how simple and power Go is, I was wondering if Go can be used for IT automation as well? Like with Go interacting with the OS/file systems/etc.

This may seem like an idiot question, I may lack some fundamental knowledge.

When you build a golang program into an executable (binary), then you run that executable in your machine, how does your OS know how to handle the go routines?

Is there a go run time environment built into the binary on top of your code?

Thks for the clarification

I have a small tcp server I am testing. On that server there is an application that connects to it. When I update my code using git, I do a ```go build``` then a ```systemctl restart tcp.service```. All this ensures that the new core runs. FYI tcp service is a systemd service I made to run the go program.
My issue is, after restarting the service (thus re running the go program) the client program drops immediately.
I have not read through the documentation of the client program just yet to figure out if there is a way to allow the client to reconnect after dropping so I decided to ask here first.

Can one update their go code but not restart/re run their go code?

I'm also thinking there is probably a way I can do some sort of fail over to ensure the tcp connection doesn't drop (if that's possible) while I update the code.
## [9][Does anybody use any other naming for the *testing.T variable in tests other than 't'? Or is it pretty much convention always name it 't'?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/f0c8mc/does_anybody_use_any_other_naming_for_the/)

A colleague asked why I dont use a more descriptive name and my answer was that this seems to be the norm whenever I read any code examples. But I'm checking to see if anybody feels like it does deserve a more descriptive name.
