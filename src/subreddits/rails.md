Hey guys, just wanted to thank all the people of the Rails community for all the help and guidance y‚Äôall gave me over the past months.

Finally deployed a working application and planning on keeping it up for a long time!

Next mini project: Deploying Wordpress to a subdomain.

Literally spent hours looking through documentation and it feels so satisfying. Goodnight! (It‚Äôs 3 AM and I have work in 4 hours. üòÇ)

Thanks again! üôè

If you would like to check where are endpoints "to-be-improved" in your application, before users will encounter it during big traffic - there you have quick blogpost about our experience apache-jmeter [https://www.2n.pl/blog/apache-jmeter](https://www.2n.pl/blog/apache-jmeter) .

I need to add this library: https://photon.komoot.de/ in my Ruby on Rails application. I should only use it in one page (view). I wouldn't want to set up complicated stuff like Webpacker. Is there any way to add a js library quickly?

My current project is not supporting IE at all. I've looked at progressive enhancement but IE is just so far behind modern browser that it doesn't even support important features for this project. Instead of having to deal with confused IE users that just see a broken site I want to automatically redirect them to a page that tells them to use a modern browser. Now I'm wondering what would be the best way to achieve this?

I've thought of three ways so far and wanted to get some opinions on them:

1. Look at useragent on rails side and use a redirect. Basically locking IE users out of the app completely because every request would be redirected.

2. Look at useragent on frontend via JS and redirect that way. Same as the first solution but would instead be happening on the users device. This would mean rails wouldn't have to check the useragent on every request.

3. Look at useragent on frontend via JS and show a notification. This would allow the user to remove the notification and "use" the application (even though IE users literally can't use it). Probably the user friendliest.

Would love to get some opinions on those options. Maybe there is also a way that I haven't even thought about?

I'm using elastic-search by following this tutorial [https://iridakos.com/programming/2017/12/03/elasticsearch-and-rails-tutorial](https://iridakos.com/programming/2017/12/03/elasticsearch-and-rails-tutorial) 

but by running  `User.import(force: true) I` face  an error `uninitialized constant Faraday::Error::ConnectionFailed`  i don't know the reason my be it occurs because I skip the kabana installation but I don't think so.

Need help from seniors.
## [8][Fill PDF form with user data [Prawn]](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/j984ay/fill_pdf_form_with_user_data_prawn/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/j984ay/fill_pdf_form_with_user_data_prawn/
---
My goal is to fill the existing PDF interactive form with user data.

Requirements for this are:

*   it SHOULD be able to insert data into text fields;
*   it SHOULD be commercial free 
*   it MAY be able to insert an image on the XY position.

Based on research, I chose [Prawn-Rails gem](https://github.com/cortiz/prawn-rails). I'm a little confused with documentation, how can fill form fields on the existing PDF interactive form? 

&amp;#x200B;

The process is like this:

User fills in the form, the service collects data from the form and generates pdf based on that. 

The generated pdf is always the same, only user data is changing.

Hi Friends,

As a beginner, i'm reading that Ruby is an excellent language to learn web programming.

What are the Limits of Ruby?

I am interested in creating a 'Shopping Site' similar to those seen when shopping LIFE INSURANCE or HEALTH INSURANCE.

Here's a Lead company that does what i'm talking about. HOWEVER, it looks like its written in 'ASP' and 'PHP'
(not sure but i checked it in Buildwith.com)

[Here's the Site]( https://www.selectquote.com/)


1. -You can see it follows some-kinda Tree System....Anyone know the Term for this design?

1. -Can i do this in Ruby?

1. -Is it possible for a 1 user to accomplish this?


Thanks very much!

## [11][Difference between to: [rating.page.user] and to: page.user.followers.to_a to exclude a notification](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/j93lmd/difference_between_to_ratingpageuser_and_to/)

If I rate a page, the author of the page will receive a notification.

BUT, as you can see, I added an if condition: if you are the author of the page (`rating.page.user`) you will not receive it.

      def after_create(rating)
        send_update_notifications(rating)
        assign_score rating.user, :create if rating.user != rating.page.user
        assign_score rating.page.user, :create if rating.user != rating.page.user
      end
    
      def send_update_notifications(rating)
        notify! rating, 'create', from: rating.user, to: [rating.page.user] if rating.user != rating.page.user
      end

&amp;#x200B;

In another area of the website, if an author will create a new page, the followers of the other pages created by the same author, will receive a notification about this new work

      def after_create(page)
        notify_followers page
        notify_staff page, 'create'
        assign_score(page.user, :create)
      end
    
      def notify_followers(page)
        notify! page, 'create', from: page.user, to: page.user.followers.to_a, scope: :follower
      end

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a BUG. In this way if the author is in the "followers list", he will receive a notification about it.

How to "exclude" the notification to the page author?

In this case I have `to: page.user.followers.to_a`, and not a *single user* as in rating area. **How to do?**
