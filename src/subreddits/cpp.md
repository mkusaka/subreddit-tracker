Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

As a C++ newcomer I often hear about Boost, however most of the things I already find in \`std\` or extracted like ASIO. What are some good libraries I am missing? For example I was interested in metaprogramming and found Boost.Hana but it seems like modern C++ metaprogramming is much easier and the library might be a bit obsolete..?

So I did a little bit of C++ in school a few years ago but it wasn’t “real” C++, definitely not modern C++. 

Now as someone who uses python all day at work, how to I learn and get better at modern C++? My goal is to atleast be intermediate with C++ within the next year so I can start targeting “cooler” projects/companies for work!  

Any feedback is appreciated, thanks!

## [5][clang shows error when using a method with a "using type alias" parameter (in this case, with std::make_index_sequence), while gcc does not. Who's right?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jmy1bh/clang_shows_error_when_using_a_method_with_a/)

The code: https://godbolt.org/z/qT6vz6

If you comment out the "template&lt;class... Ts&gt; using theAlias" line, and uncomment the "template&lt;class... Ts&gt; struct theAlias", both compilers issue no errors.

x86-64 clang versions 9.0.0 and up shows the error: "error: no matching function for call to 'theFxn'"

x86-64 gcc 10.1 and up compiles the code.

Who's right?

I made a thread-safe memory manager in C++ that prevents memory leaks. It comes with a simple DSL and includes support for smart-pointers. You can also get allocation stats and memory traces.

Almost all code styles describe \`struct\` as a POD, which is a nonsense. The only differences are default access specifiers, which are better in case of the \`struct\`: you almost always use \`public\` inheritance, and your \`struct\`/\`class\` always use public members. Making distinction between these alternatives is harmful, because this isn't something that comes from language, it's just a weird convention

Yet another rust vs CPP post, I know :( but hopefully I am coming from a different place to make it interesting.

So C++ was the first language I learned in school and college. I would say i used to only be an intermediate level programmer with C++ 11, despite using it as my primary language for 5-6 years :)
Towards the end of University however I moved to Machine Learning Research and thus Python became my primary programming language. In just 2-3 years I would say I became better at Python than I ever was at C++ in terms of confidence in writing good code. Right now I think I am a pretty good python developer. I don't remember ever thinking that I am pretty good at c++ :(

I am not looking for a new job or anything, I enjoy working in ML research. But I would like to take some time to do some personal projects typically linux command line applications/helpers to manage some of my workflow and maybe contribute to some open source projects when I have free time. Ideally in a language that is not Python.

So I was thinking of either revisiting C++ with all it's latest features or check out the next hyped thing in rust.
My question is how easy it is to pick up C++ again with all it's latest features? Consider the following points:

1.  Is the documentation and information about new features (post C++ 11) accessible ? Are there cool projects that are written in modern C++ with best practices that I can check out and learn from ?
2.  I remember struggling a lot with using templates initially, especially the unhelpful error messages, is the situation better now?
3. I also remember build systems being a complete mess, with Makefiles, CMake and pretty poor documentation about how to get things done in a good, elegant way. How is the situation now?

Ultimately, I am not looking to become a professional C++ or rust developer anytime in the future. I am just looking to keep up with some language other than python. C++, rust are good candidates as they are statically typed and would be a a good complement to my python skillz :).  **So my biggest consideration is having fun developing some cool new projects as a hobby**. Considering that should I revisit C++ again or maybe check out rust ?
