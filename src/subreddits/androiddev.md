This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**How to download the songs?**

You can download all of them in one RAR &amp; ZIP file by following this [Bandcamp](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/releases) link.

**What's the total size of the library and in which format do they come in?**

Total file size varies in format. You can download the songs in MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, ALAC, WAV and AIFF formats.

**What about the license? (CC BY 4.0)**

You can use any song in this library in anyway you want, be it as a sound effect in your game or as a background music in one of your Youtube &amp; Twitch videos, even commercially. If you'd like to find more information about the license, please check this [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) link. Providing an appropriate credit (Either Composed by [onemansymphony.bandcamp.com](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com) or patreon.com/onemansymphony) is required.

**What is the future of this library? How can I support it?**

I'm planning to expand this library's content as much as possible, and doing so takes a great amount of time, and calls for new virtual instruments and tools to create songs in rich and different sound. My current goal is to keep adding more songs in different genres into this library as well as creating environmental sound effects in high quality.  Also Bandcamp limits the quantity of free downloads so I need to buy more "free download credits" to make the album even more accessible. More information about the subject can be found [​here](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2010/09/09/free-downloads-power-ups/). Due to these reasons, I created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony) page if you'd like to support this project. By becoming a Patron, **you'll get access to the loop files, bonus and alternative songs and sound effects** that are not included in the public library hosted on Bandcamp.

**Can I remix the songs in the library?**

As long as you provide an appropriate credit to the original album, you can do whatever you want to do with them.

**Are these songs loopable?**

Almost every single song in the album (with a few exceptions here and there) is loopable. While producing these songs, I always paid extra attention to make them as loopable as possible since some users would like to break a song into seperate pieces and just want to use that specific section of the song in their projects, and some people might like to extend a specific part of the song for adaptive sound design purposes. I am very well aware of that modern video games call for an application of adaptive sound design. A song which is made of different sections should be easily loopable &amp; cuttable and any section of the song should be easily extandable. And whenever a transition occurs, it should sound as smooth as possible. These were the things that I kept in my mind while composing these pieces. If you'd like to create your own loop files out of these songs, you can use a free software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to do so and refer to its [manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/) to learn more about how looping is done. If you don't want to spend your time with the process of looping, you can subscribe to my $1 tier on Patreon where you can get access to the loop files of the songs in the library.

**Is this album updated regularly?**

Yes! Whenever I add a new song or sound effect to the library, I announce it on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onemansymphony). I would suggest checking the tweets or the album page regularly if you're in need of new music frequently.

Feel free to ask if you guys have any questions.
## [5][Got app rejection this month saying just 2 words as a clue of what's wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hrkaq5/got_app_rejection_this_month_saying_just_2_words/)

This month I got an app rejection that :

For [this spare time app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.contacts_sync), I got a letter talking about "Metadata policy" and that there is an issue with “Disclaimer / Disclaimer:” :

[https://i.imgur.com/AD8YIs1.png](https://i.imgur.com/AD8YIs1.png)

The only thing I updated for the app was targeting API 30 (Android 11), so it was weird for me and I kept asking what's wrong with the disclaimer, as I was told before that I should add it. Not only that, but I didn't change anything about strings for quite a while.

Since the main language of the app is in English, I was sure it's some issue with it. Especially when the email writes only in English.

After sending an appeal, requesting to understand what's wrong, it turns out that one of the translators (Vietnamese) showed both his translation and the English one for this word (in the app description), meaning : "Disclaimer/sanggahan:" . 

Why is it an issue? Because it was detected by Google as "**excessive keywords"**   **:**

&gt;Please remove excessive keywords from all translations of your store listing.

I don't understand how could the word "disclaimer" be a keyword that could be abusing the system. I also don't understand how I could have understood all of this by the first letter, especially when it's written in English... 

Anyway, I removed the English one from there, and now all is fine again...

Are there any in-depth explanations of how Androids scrolling system works? (onScrollChanged, overScroll, Scroller, NestedScrolling, etc.)

I've been trying to get into Android App Development recently, and since Kotlin is supposedly the future of the OS, I've been going through [Big Nerd Ranch's Kotlin Book](https://www.amazon.com/Kotlin-Programming-Nerd-Ranch-Guide/dp/0135161630) on it. The book itself focuses more on Kotlin as a language than the process of app-building itself, so the fact that it uses IntelliJ to do so doesn't give me the utmost confidence to continue with the IDE without question after the book.

As far as I understand, AS is catered for app development, whereas IntelliJ is just general Java/Android programming, with the potential to be made for app development with enough workaround and installments.

But I've also heard that AS can slow down your computer quite a bit, as well. I haven't really heard these complaints about IntelliJ, so I guess there's a tradeoff?

Since I'm early in the Android Dev game, I figured I should pick the best road in the beginning, rather than hopping back and forth every year.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
