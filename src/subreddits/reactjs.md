We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [7][React + Flask, how to use Auth0?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f65nag/react_flask_how_to_use_auth0/)

Noob here. I have a React + Flask stack going on and want to use the Auth0 service to add authentication.  Flask is just exposing an API and handles all the database changes. Going through the Auth0 docs I am getting confused as to what parts are relevant to Flask vs. React?

Do I use Auth0's "Single Page Application" setup? That seems to focus only on React. Or do I use the "Web App" setup, but that seems to focus only on Flask API.

If I set this up with React interfacing with Auth0, do I pass tokens recieved onto my Flask backend so my server knows what business logic to show for this authenticated user?

Anyone else deal with this stack? Would love to know of potential resources I could take a look at.

I launched the first video of a series on my youtube channel.

In this first video, you'll learn about the Next.js Router.

This is a good video for beginners and intermediate developers - step by step.

I hope it's helpful and you enjoy it! :)

What are some of the common misconceptions among React developers? I find that learning some of the misconceptions beforehand can prevent you from making a huge design mistake.
