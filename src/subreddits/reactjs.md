Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience

Hey devs.

I came across this question and I really would appreciate some guidance in the common/best practice.

I am building a system where companies can sign up, and this will generate a job portal for them. Through a dashboard, they will be able to manage their job positions and the candidates that applied for each position.

From the perspective of a guest (someone looking for a job in the particular company), this person will go to 
www.domain.com/companyName and this route will fetch all the job positions from the specific company.

So:

route /companyName - all the job positions 

route /companyName/:jobId - specific job listing

Question:

-Should I fetch the data only in the main route (all listings) component and save it to my state (Context API, Redux, etc ...) so I don't need to make API calls in other components (like the page with data for a specific job)?

OR

-Should I make API calls in every component and forget saving it to the state?

Both ways will work, but what is the common practice?
Why one way would be better than the other?

Thank you all in advance.

Any React devs who also happen to like wine?  I recognize this is a 'funny' post but I am serious.  I started a personal project back in 2018 to give me something to build on and learn for work and personal growth.  It was super simple at first as I followed a tutorial for the initial build.  Eventually a senior dev (Principal Engineer) at Red Hat reached out as he was studying the WSET to become a Sommelier.  Here we are a year later and it has grown well beyond what I ever could have imagined.  

I have the main project up which has our Spring MVC and Rest Controllers.  Our frontend is in HTML/Thymeleaf currently but have decided that React is the future.  Just last night I added the React project.

I am a Java backend dev by day so learning React is for fun and slow going.  If you're interested there are a few ways I could use some help:

1. Actual dev work in the form of pull requests or even project ownership
2. Creating issues to help guide me or other junior devs who want to help
3. Notes of any kind

## [8][Hand over deployable React project to client without sharing source code?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hj6xna/hand_over_deployable_react_project_to_client/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hj6xna/hand_over_deployable_react_project_to_client/

I am working on my first **React** (`create-react-app`) project that will ultimately be delivered to a client I am implementing the app for. We agreed on me delivering a "ready to deploy" build, as the client intends to host the app by himself. As we agreed that the source code of the app will still remain my intellectual property (IP), I'd like to know if there are any best practices of how this can go down without me simply sharing the entire project (e.g. giving access to the git repo) including all source code files?

So far I have figured out that you can create a production build (`npm run build`) and disable source map generation (`GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`) in the build step. This will essentially make the code non human readable.

Now my question: Is it feasible to only share the **build folder** created with `npm run build`with the client and will he be able to deploy this? Or are there any better suggestions?

Hi guys!

I've this problem that I can't figure a way of solving it...

So, I've one NextJS app built with a custom express server. One of my routes is responsible to handle image uploads to the server and then saving them in public folder.

During development I made some tests and I had some files in `public/images/articles` folder. 

I ran `next build` and everything works well in `production`. If I upload some file in `production`, the file is being saved correctly, however, when I go to `https://&lt;myurl&gt;/images/articles/&lt;new file added&gt;` I get a 404. The file is in the filesystem but it's not being served by my app. 

The files that existed in `public` folder are served right. Is there anything that I should do in my server file to serve files from public that were added after the current build? 

Thanks!
## [12][New to Reactjs and indepth JS and having problems understanding the flow of things when setting state on a list of objects (includes a loop)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hj5szk/new_to_reactjs_and_indepth_js_and_having_problems/)

The function below loops through a list of objects, changes a couple of values of each object and then performs a DB update. After the forEach loop I set the state of two variables: athletes and startTime.

The output in the console displays the message: 'DISPLAYING _ATHLETES' with the correct updated data **before** the messages in the .then block.

Is this correct? Although I'm getting the correct results, it seems odd. If the last message in the function is printed first, I'm assuming the setAthlete and setStartTime would also be called at the same time and in the case of setAthletes, it would be set with the data of athletes when I made the copy and not the correct updated values.

I hope that's clear.

I also feel as though the way I have done it is not the React way so any pointers would be great on how to adopt better coding style.


    const setInitialStartTime = () =&gt; {
        const startTime = new Date()

        // make a copy of athletes so I can be sure that the console.log 
        // at the bottom really refers to changed data
        const _athletes = [...athletes]

        athletes.forEach((athlete, index) =&gt; {  
      
          athlete.laps = []
          athlete.lapStartTime = startTime

          athleteService.update(athlete)
            .then(response =&gt; {
              console.log('UPDATED ATHLETE', athlete)
              _athletes[index] = athlete
            })
            .catch(error =&gt; console.log('error:', error))
        })
        console.log('DISPLAYING _ATHLETES', _athletes)
        setAthletes(_athletes)
        setSStartTime(startTime.toString());
      }
