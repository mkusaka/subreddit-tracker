I‚Äôve been trying to learn React for awhile and did the usual thing of watching crash course videos and tutorials then trying out my own projects. I‚Äôd occasionally look at the docs when I couldn‚Äôt get my head around something.

For the last day I‚Äôve sat down and read them through from the start while toying with some of the snippets provided and I can‚Äôt get over how much clearer everything is! They‚Äôre easy to understand and cover the basics really well!

This should be obvious to everyone and I almost feel silly saying it, but if you want to learn a technology...

Start with the documentation! üòõ

I've been trying out styled-components on a medium sized project, and while I love the idea of styled-components, I'm not satisfied with how my files are organised. 

I have a `styles/` folder containing three sub-folders:

* `helpers/`, where I put files like `colors.js`, `breakpoints.js`, `fonts.js`...
* `global/`, where I put styled files for very small independent components like `Button.js`, `SmallText.js`, `SubTitle.js`...
* `components/`, which contains project specific styled files, organised in subfolders:
   * `layout/`, itself containing styled files for the Footer and the Header, each in their own subfolder
   * `pages/`, with a subfolder for each page, containing subfolders for every big section of the given page
   * ...and a few folders for components that need multiple styled files and which could be used on any page

I made [a (simplified) diagram](https://imgur.com/ppiowxV) to help you see better what I mean.

I only made a homepage containing a hero and a simple grid of links to news articles displayed in card format, yet I already feel like I'm drowning in folders and files. And that's just for the styling part of things. I feel like I'm not going the right way at all, as I don't feel this kind of structure is scalable at all.

Is there a scalable standard I could follow and easily use on big projects for styled-components ? Most articles I find on styled-components don't talk about folders structure.

I mostly or I can say employers mostly kept me at backend while developing web applications. I am a Nodejs developer and developing in it from past 3 years(professionally). However my relationship with front end side is of kind on and off. Angular is what I am used to dabble in mostly whenever I got chance. I first learned React in 2015 and from then on kept myself awared of the new features and trends but haven't got chance to develop apps in react other than one or two video courses I do every year just to kill time.

I work in a Angular based team but convinced my seniors to go with react for an upcoming project( my manager has unrealistic expectation from this project). But right now I am on my own even all of the UI/UX designers are used to angular. So I will be getting plain html/css files (no ng ui components setup).
## [12][Free resources (Youtube, docs etc.) or a Udemy course to learn React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ha1bgx/free_resources_youtube_docs_etc_or_a_udemy_course/)

After learning Node.js, I thought to improve my Front End skills with React. However, I am a bit lost. Youtube has a wide choice but the courses are around 2 hours each, and I don't know whether that's enough to learn it. On the other hand, there are a few Udemy courses which are about 40 hours each which might be a bit overwhelming and long, and cost as well. 

Is there a ton to learn about React that I would have to get the courses, or can I absorb necessary information from free sources that are available? What is the best approach?
