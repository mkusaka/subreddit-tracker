This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I've been an Android dev for a year now and feel like I sick at code reviews. Most of my comments are just styling/syntax issues.

For experienced people, what is your process exactly?

Additionally are there resources out there to help me get better?

I've been looking for other reports about this issue that I'm having. So far I have confirmed this on both my desktop (linux) and macbook (OSX Catalina), this also happen on two of my coworkers (using macbook), but another coworker doesn't have this issue.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
Basically the issue is, if you type something and Android Studio give you a suggestions, all of a sudden it doesn't accept you input anymore or severely lagging and skipping letters. You need to dismiss the suggestion in order have normal typing again.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
Does anybody else have this issue? Is there a bug tracker entry I can follow?

About one year ago I had an idea for an alternative approach to UI testing on Android. Instead of ID matching, I would be fully relying on computer vision.

Over the last year I put a lot of hours in creating this software I had in mind. It's now called repeato, and it's essentially a test recorder which allows you record and replay your tests via a desktop app.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am looking for feedback and beta testers.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to get you motivated, I offer you direct support (skype/email) and an unlimited version of the software for those of you who get back to me with some feedback before 1st of April. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every feedback is very welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

So here is a 1-min-demo-video:
