Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I am currently planning to write an app for Windows 10 and publish it to the store. I have been programming with mostly C++ (using Qt) for quite some time now. I know that Microsoft uses C# a lot and by running Visual Studio I can see that they have a lot of tooling around it. C# also seems like a nice language (I am somewhat familiar with it but I have mostly used C++).
So I am undecided between using C++/winrt vs c# and Microsoft doesn't seem to provide any info on what should one choose. Does anyone have any experience or have developed using C++ (in. Net or UWP) on Windows 10? How did you find it?
