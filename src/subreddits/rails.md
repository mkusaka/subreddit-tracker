## [3][Same base project in three different instances. What do you suggest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jfa5h0/same_base_project_in_three_different_instances/)

Let's say you have the project X which is a simple Rails app. It's open source in github. 

Then you decide you will host the project on a custom VPS with capistrano for example and sell it to people as a SaaS. 

And then, you build another instance with small differences and sell it as a business app on a different domain. 

What is the right way to accomplish that without going crazy? 

The use case is that I've build an app and I want to try and see If it gets any customers. It will have two plans, a personal and a business one. Obviously, the differences with the open source app would be to have extra models as `subscriptions` and more security. 

Should I keep the same *Core* and build everything else on top of gems and engines ? Or is there any other common solution I am missing ?

Thanks in advance!

I am trying to build a stripped down version of a spree type application to learn. In my product form I want to be able to attached option\_types to it. I do this by having a select field that has select2 on it. I choose the option types needed from the list and it adds them in as a sort of tags type text field. I think it should come out in the form params as a comma delimited field based on how I have it set up. 

When I update a product after I have selected some option types the product updates but I am getting the following error on an unpermitted parameter:

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried everything and can't figure out why that is happening. Any thoughts on what the issue is based on the info below?

product controller:

## [6][New rails project postgres issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jf2n05/new_rails_project_postgres_issue/)

 As the default configuration, a user called postgres is made and the user postgres has full superadmin access to the entire PostgreSQL instance running on your OS.The default Postgres user is postgres and a password is not required for authentication. Thus, to add a password, we must first login and connect as the postgres user   


In a new rails project, whenever I perform rake db it either tells me: 

 `peer authentication failed for user 'postgres'` or `no password supplied for postgres`

I shouldnt have to necessarily touch `pg_hba.conf` file or \password

Iâm a returning Rails developer from the 4.2 days. Been out a couple years. 

I used to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, because we had other AWS resources that our app used.

But here I am in October 2020, trying to get even the Rails 6 âyay youâre on Railsâ default app running on Beanstalk, and itâs an endless slog of deploy, fail, check the logs, google the error, try a fix, repeat.

Is Beanstalk the wrong solution now? How do people host Rails apps on AWS? Iâve never used containers - is that the approach I should take?

Ran `rake routes` and this

Its a new project and I only used `rails g scaffold` to create some model   

I did nothing with action_mailbox, rails conductor, active_storage yet there a bunch of routes showing. presumably I expected them not to appear

So I'm upgrading from 4.2 to 5.0.0 and it's not going so well.

Here's the stackoverflow question I posted: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64428360/upgrading-from-rails-4-2-0-to-5-0-0-and-ruby-from-2-2-4-to-2-5-8-circular-depe

If anyone has any idea what I'm doing wrong I would be forever in your debt.

Basically I need to upgrade my ruby/rails version before heroku EOLs their 14.04 stack. I've follow guides on how to upgrade, but I'm obviously missing something and I can start a server, but it throws an exception about a circular dependency...and I have no idea how to solve it.

Thanks in advance.

Say you join a project and you need to set up your local dev environment. You install Rails, bundle install etc., but how exactly does the database portion work?

What I mean is, there's a production database that's pretty large with a couple dozen tables. When I work on the app locally, it won't run without connecting to a database for logins etc. Should I clone the whole production database and reproduce it locally, or what is the best practice here?

---
Stocks are often charted out with prices and their given date of change. 

IF you have a single stock and wanted to show the price changing over time, how would you model that in your database? 

Sounds like TONS of data...

**edit!** 

Thanks for the comments. I ended up doing basically what u/UwRandom had recommended!

Main table has generic/aggregate information and a separate table stores the price changes.

Looking for an open sources solution to collect logs (centralize logging). Please suggest if you are using something in production. What has worked out well for you. 

\- graylog  
\- logstash  
\- fluend  
\- something else (hopefully)
