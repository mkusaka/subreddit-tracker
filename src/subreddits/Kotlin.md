Figured I'd give Android programming a shot. I've written a LOT of Kotlin, and I've been a registered Apple Developer for years, and own pretty much everything they make.

Which device would you say represents a reference platform, maybe with the least quirks, I'm probably looking at a Tablet because I won't really use a phone.  Recommendations?

Hi, I was looking for advice and your opinion.

I am looking at Android mobile and desktop GUI program development and I'm looking at platforms with which to develop for both Android and desktop (Linux,MAC,Windows).

I already know C++/Qt but I'm guessing that it's not optimal on Android. Moreover, I might want to sell the Android/PC software package I write and Qt licensing for that seems expensive. I know Qt can be developed for mobile Android but I'm thinking you would still need to call Java libraries and therefore you wouldn't gain much performance on Android as compared to Kotlin or Java? Moreover, the community for Android Qt would probably be MUCH smaller than for Java/Kotlin on Android?

React Native looks attractive for Android but what about performance?

That seems to leave Kotlin for the best alternative. In that case, I would want to learn and write Kotlin for the desktop side of the software package and that means JavaFX. I know that TornadoFX exists for Kotlin, but I'm skeptical of its support and also TornadoFX doesn't seem to have as good of documentation. Good documentation is a deal maker/breaker for me and I have a book on JavaFX.

Since I'm familiar with Qt/C++/Python, I'm wondering how Kotlin/JavaFX will compare to Qt as far as ease of development, once I learn Kotlin and JavaFX? Is it worth learning Kotlin/JavaFX for this project and maybe others in the future as compared to slogging along in Qt/C++?

Thanks in advance!
