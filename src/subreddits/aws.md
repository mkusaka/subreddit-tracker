This is a part of my product research I've been doing for a while. Is there some tool out there that can allow you to setup the infrastructure on AWS through a GUI tool, like just drag and drop or the way one draws their architect diagrams?

If it's there, do you use it regularly? If not, how would it help you?

Hello. I'm not very familiar with RDS. I got a notification from aws to update RDS CA Certificate to 2019 version. I was surprised, because I don't use certificate to connect to my DB (I only use username and password).
So I have a question. Can certificate update to 2019 version cause problems for my applications (every one of which only uses username and password) and cause connection problems?

I had some WAF configuration earlier but recently i decided update some rules but i noticed that aws deployed WAF v2.  
What are the difference between them?  
 and is there any benefit  to migrate to new WAF?

Anyone know when we can expect new Windows AMIs that are patched for CVE-2020-0601?

We have an AWS security account in our org that is storing the CloudTrail messages of 20+ accounts in an S3 bucket.

What would be the optimal way of triggering an action if an account logs a specific CloudTrail message? 
For example, how would I trigger a Lambda if account 111111111111 has CloudTrail message CreateInternetGateway?
