This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

I wrote a post and a sample app for how to render Markdown content using Jetpack Compose. 

Hope you like it!

## [4][PSA: BuildCompat.isAtLeastR() incompatible with released version of 11/R](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ipdv64/psa_buildcompatisatleastr_incompatible_with/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ipdv64/psa_buildcompatisatleastr_incompatible_with/
---
This is defined as:
```
public static boolean isAtLeastR() {  
 return VERSION.CODENAME.length() == 1  
 &amp;&amp; VERSION.CODENAME.charAt(0) &gt;= 'R'  
 &amp;&amp; VERSION.CODENAME.charAt(0) &lt;= 'Z';  
}
```
The release version of 11 `CODENAME` is `"REL"` so `length() &gt; 1` and returns `false`.

This is using:
```
implementation 'androidx.core:core:1.3.1'
implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.3.1'
```
The latest stable version (at time of writing).

Be warned!

Workaround:
`Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= 30` or `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.R`

Edit:
Markdown had italics highlighting by mistake. Forgot `=` in workaround.

Additional edit:
I now realise that `BuildCompat` is precisely for targeting pre-release versions of Android. So using it in production code is not intended. Either way it's likely to be fixed with a real version check in future.

I was just going to suggest using it for a project and saw the last release was well over a year ago. As well as that, there's \~1700 issues on the [repo.](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) Just wondering if people are still actively adding this to projects, and if not, what's the best alternative? I'm looking for something that has a few different graphs, and ideally supports some interaction.

I've seen the video about Square Workflow at Droidcon and tried it out with a dummy project, but I still have a few questions about it and think this is the right place to discuss about it.

* Do you use it in production ? What is your experience with it ?
* Does it work well with asynchronous source of data ? I'm thinking about an app that heavily rely on Firestore to write and read data.
* Does it work well with more complex Android UI Components like ViewPager2 ?
## [11][Memoji Stickers For Android (Proper Catagories)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ipfhh4/memoji_stickers_for_android_proper_catagories/)

Switching from Iphone to Android ,users miss one thing while texting, MEMOJIs. So i decided to find a way to use the same memojis of apple on android.
Now there are alot of apps already providing you with memojis on android, problem is that they havent catagorized it with a proper plain, or most of them havent catagorized them at all. 
So , i have grouped the memojis on the basis of proper catagories based on the Hair color, Skin Tone and wearing accessories. The first build has 9 catagories, new catagories will be uploaded every week.

Question from developers ?

I need suggestion in code,  on how to add tags to each memoji, so that users can choose on the basis of those tags. The tags might include Hair colors, Face Color , Accessories etc

Thank you :)
