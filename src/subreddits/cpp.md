**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

I spent the last few days digging into the depths of the Unicode specification because I can't wrap my head around how to integrate utf8 support into my existing project. It seems like that most libraries do not properly deal with grapheme cluster: `u8"Ã¨".find_first('e')` will always return positive. I am aware of the ongoing controversy about what actually counts as a character (Code units, code points or user-perceived characters) and doing proper Grapheme splitting (Text Boundary Analysis) etc is expensive and probably should not be part of a low-level utf8 String. ICU has their BreakIterator, which you can use to count user-perceived characters. It's quite slow though and possibly nothing you'd want to every time you construct a string or query it's length.
What would you recommend? Should I just naively deal with grapheme and pretty much ignore their existence... Or could this cause issues in the future? I am kinda worried that once I make a utf8 string available in the code base coworkers will start doing splitting, replacing etc with user content (which may or may not have graphemes) and get the wrong results. 

http://utf8everywhere.org/
This excellent document is proposing to always use utf8 (which I agree on) and keep using `std::string`. I am not a big fan of the latter as some of the member functions would be broken for non-ASCII input.... and the type is not "strong" enough to signal that it's really storing utf8. (Might need to wait for char8_t)

Are there any updates on CWG issue 2313?

https://wg21.link/CWG2313

The proposed resolution dates from 2017 yet it seems nothing is concrete yet. 

The following code works in MSVC and GCC but not on Clang:

    int main() {
        auto [x, y] = [] { return std::make_pair(1, 2); }();
        return [&amp;] { return x + y; }();
    }

Can template literals be used in C++, for example, 

cout&lt;&lt;I have some things to do, which are ${expression} when you don't know about them.

Here, expression="really very hard"

Thanks.

Hi, few days ago I started my own blog and wrote my first post.  My reason for starting a blog is to improve my writing skills since I am not a native English speaking person. Other reason is to have a place where I can store information that I find relevant. I would very much appreciate any kind of feedback.  


Thank you for time spent reading the material. I would also like to know what is your opinion on the topic.

## [12][STX: C++ 20 Error and Optional-Value Handling Library (Result, Option, Panics, and Backtracing)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gw14ke/stx_c_20_error_and_optionalvalue_handling_library/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gw14ke/stx_c_20_error_and_optionalvalue_handling_library/

Hello everyone,

I have been exploring and evaluating error-handling models across the C++ ecosystem for the past 3 months. Primarily because I needed a proper and deterministic error-handling model for fail-often systems (embedded systems) in which exceptions don't fit the bill **yet**. Even with some embedded toolchains not having an actual exception implementation. The overall reliability and security of these systems are highly impacted by the error-handling model.

From my exploration and interaction with other developers, I found that the **Result** and **Option** type monads were highly preferred to other models and are much more intuitive due to the error-handling logic abstraction, and the concise and deterministic success and failure paths they provide. In addition, many of the engineers had already rolled their in-house implementations.

Here are a **few** open-source projects that also replicate the same error-handling types/models: [LLVM's ErrorOr](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/llvm/include/llvm/Support/ErrorOr.h), [Mozilla MFBT's Result](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mfbt/Result.h), Fuchsia OS' [Result](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/zircon/system/ulib/zxc/), [StatusOr](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/zircon/system/ulib/intel-hda/include/intel-hda/utils/status_or.h), and [Panic](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/HEAD/zircon/system/public/zircon/assert.h), [Pigweed's Result](https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/pigweed/+/refs/heads/master/pw_result/), [Simdjson's Result](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/include/simdjson/error.h), etc. Another great approach is error-handling macros like [ENSURE\_OK, DCHECK\_OK, QCHECK\_OK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/status.h) which I came across during my open-source work on Tensorflow micro.

As with many cases of code duplication even within the same codebase, they can have really subtle bugs (i.e. Mozilla's Result).

Some programming languages adopt this functional approach i.e: Haskell (`Either`),  Scala (`Try` &amp; `Option`), Rust (`Result` &amp; `Option`).

**STX** (*standard-extended*) is a C++20 library that aims to unify these development efforts and make it easier to manage errors and also provide some development utilities.

# STX Library Features

* **Result&lt;T, E&gt;** and **Option&lt;T&gt;** (with monadic methods) and ***constexpr*** support
   * Local explicit error propagation (with `TRY_OK` &amp; `CO_TRY_OK`)
   * **std::error\_code** and *exception-object* compatible
   * fast and deterministic success and failure paths
   * errors and nullability can not be ignored implicitly
* Panics  (i.e. fail-fast abandonment)
   * Panic backtracing
   * Thread-safe runtime panic hooks (especially for DLL *drivers*)
   * Panic Handlers (reporting preference varies from project to project. i.e:  log to disk, log to *journal*, halting, etc)
   * Reporting
* \*Fatal signal backtracing (**SIGILL**, **SIGSEGV**, and **SIGFPE**)
* No **RTTI**, memory allocation, nor *exceptions*
* Manual backtracing library based on *Abseil*
