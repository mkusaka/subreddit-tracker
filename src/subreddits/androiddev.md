This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Alternatives to [Square's Spoon](https://square.github.io/spoon/) - anyone know of any good? Requirements:

- Command-line based, not requiring the Android SDK to be installed but instead run against the already built pair of APKs.
- UI presenting test results with..:
	- Presenting Espresso screenshots taken during test run
	- Stack trace on errors
	- Logcat output on errors
- (Preferrably) Parallell device execution. (I suppose this can be worked around by launching mulitple shells)
- (Would be awesome) Live update of test results during execution

Why not Spoon?
- The UI is good but not great. I'm not a big fan of a segmented bar representing test results
- It doesn't allow individual input to individual devices ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15188756/how-to-pass-an-argument-to-an-androidtestcase))
- It's not maintained

I wrote a sample app trying out some ideas around a more functional architecture for Android and the [result is here](https://github.com/LordRaydenMK/SuperheroesAndroid).  Any feedback is welcomed.

To clarify im talking about google play store. Or shouldn't i create a new release but instead upload the whole app as a new app?

thanks in advance

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I just made a tutorial about updating widget using Kotlin Flow, Room and Hilt.

[Android widgets – Update using Kotlin Flow, Room and Hilt](https://inspirecoding.app/android-widgets-update-using-kotlin-flow-room-and-hilt/)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this approach?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

## [11][After A10 upgrade my stock launcher overrides all widgets swipe gesture. So swiping down in scrollable widgets triggers system swipe down gesture...How to fix it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/imxemj/after_a10_upgrade_my_stock_launcher_overrides_all/)

Title says it all. It is very annoying and it happens for all widgets. 

*I need to scroll very carefully inside widgets to not trigger system scroll gestures...*

Is there a way to fix it, besides changing launcher? 

Seems to be related to A10 in general, because I also noticed the same behavior on my friend's Xiaomi after update, he complained about it too.

Do manufacturers not test their upgrades? It is annoying af :(
