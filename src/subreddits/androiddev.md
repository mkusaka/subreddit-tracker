Have seen various advice out there. I've been experimenting for a while with examples of OKHttp interceptors that reauthenticate unauthorized 401 requests. But I kept running into threading issues and had more luck with authenticate-in-advance. Wonder what your experiences have been like.

My third game for android has been getting a steady increase in active installations for over a month, but I noticed that around 2/3 of new installations end in an uninstallation in the same day. I believe that that number is pretty high, how many people install and then uninstall (in the same day) your app ?

Learning Java for mobile dev android studio

I am working on my first mobile dev project. I want it to be well structured and organized. I was wondering how I could achieve that. Knowing JAVA is an OOP, should I be making a new file for every new class I need and a separate file to do all the procedural programming ? Any help is appreciated! Thank you in advance !

1. Am I supposed to mark my beer menu reader app as "promoting alcohol" and thereby getting the "mature" rating? It doesn't really promote alcohol but at the same time it does refer to alcohol because the whole point is to take a picture of a beer menu and see the user ratings. 
2. How would such a rating affect AdMob ad revenue? I tested one ad in real life and it looked very abnormal; a very uncharacteristically plain gray background with no images leading to something that seemed like a dating site (I didn't click on it). It might even be interpreted as part of the UI of my app. I thought ads are supposed to be colorful and more, well, ad-like. Is this because of my "mature" content rating?

Anyone know how can I improve performance of Android Studio Emulator? It is really laggy and slow, no matter if I manually edit config.ini values and increase ram or cpu cores it can use, it is still slow on onPress events and keeps stuttering while scrolling. I think it is not properly utilizing GPU hw acceleration..

I have Ryzen 3800X, 32GB 3200MHz RAM and Nvidia GTX 1070 8GB. Windows is clean and freshly installed. Android emulator is up to date also.
## [12][How to do Material Transitions between Fragments in seperate Activities](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i3bgi8/how_to_do_material_transitions_between_fragments/)

Hello.

I have been doing a lot of reading / experimenting with shared transitions. 

Specifically for activities using ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation() and for fragments using addSharedElement() on a transaction

This seems to work fine for Activity -&gt; Activity or within the same Activity (Fragment -&gt; Fragment).

However the case I cannot get to work is as follows.  Activity A has a Fragment B which contains a recycler view.  I want to transition when a view in Fragment B recycler view is clicked to new started Activity C which contains Fragment D where Fragment D has the actual content.

So essentially a Fragment transition between an existing Activity and a new one starting up

Had anyone had experience with this type of transition and can possibly share a code example?  I have read a few posts which have claimed the above is impossible but wanted to check here
