I'm torn, I use both. But I need to teach this to people and not sure which one really would be the best option to go with. We don't have time to really cover both though I would love to-- it's rapid pace.

The goal ultimately is to get these people working ASAP.

Thoughts? Opinions?

This lets any kind of users to create a tour of the website. It's still on development.

I searched for something like these but they all are paid and platform based. So I wanted to make it open source for everyone to integrate. Just wanna ask if its legit and people are interested helping me.

So I have been using [socket.io](https://socket.io) in a nodejs backend and socket.io-client in the corresponding react native app for communicating messages. Initially in the android app, I get a yellow box message: Unrecognized WebSocket connection option(s) \`agent\`, \`perMessageDeflate\`, \`pfx\`, \`key\`, \`passphrase\`, \`cert\`, \`ca\`, \`ciphers\`, \`rejectUnauthorized\`. Did you mean to put these under \`headers\`?

The app works fine anyway, and after a quick google search, it turns out this message is harmless. But occasionally, after the app has been running for some time, this message appears again, and the communication stops. Restarting the node server does not help. There is no fixed time after which this happens, and in most of my test runs this does not happen. I checked the logs from 'adb logcat', but couldn't find anything different around the initial and new appearance of this same message. 

Has anyone faced something similar? If yes, how did you solve this? Please comment if you need some more details.

Hi I'm a big noob here. I've been trying to find online resources for and ways that I can retrieve information from PostgreSQL database and use in the react front end. I have a basic understanding of PostgreSQL working as my database, React for front-end and Express for bridging the two. Does anyone have useful resources for using Postgres with React? or How can I get information from my PostgreSQL database and use it in the front end?
