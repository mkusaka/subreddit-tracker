The  title says it all, this is a small dashboard I created with a  coursemate for our Information Visualisation module back in May (we  could only make it public now), requiring us to visualise any dataset  fully in D3.JS, and we naturally chose coronavirus data as it was (and  still is) quite a hype topic.

**You can visit the visualisation here:** [**corona-virus-insights.herokuapp.com**](https://corona-virus-insights.herokuapp.com/)**.**

**The code is open-sourced on GitHub and available here:** [**github.com/Adamouization/Corona-Virus-Insights-Dashboard**](https://github.com/Adamouization/Corona-Virus-Insights-Dashboard)**.**

The data source is originally from [JHU CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/),  while the visualisation is hosted on a Heroku web server. If you have  any further questions about the visualisations or the code, don't  hesitate to ask us!

Any feedback  is obviously welcomed, we'd love to hear on ways to eventually improve  our visualisations and learn more about D3.JS along the way.
