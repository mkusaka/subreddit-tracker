It was written 100% using Javascript. Pure React in frontend. NodeJS in backend.

Howdy folks, I'm learning React and added this to be able to create React Components from the CLI.  
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-react-cli)

It added typescript and made the tsx components really neat looking.  
[https://pastebin.com/yESLsesG](https://pastebin.com/yESLsesG)   
Where do I add functions?   
All google searches (that I've found) just return how to create the .FC component, but none come up with create a function.  


Sorry for the newbie question, but it's driving me mad.

It is console logging the right array out all the time, but the point here is that it should be outputting that in the 'TodoList.tsx'. Not sure how to get that fixed in this case. Anyone who could help me with this. To see the bigger picture, please click on this link:

[Link to Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/chiholiu/todo-react-typescript)

I want the returned value from **App.js** currentFilter function pass it to **TodoListItem.js**, so it will update the map function constantly when user clicks on filter buttons.

I have access to Pluralsight, Egghead and Frotendmasters. I know that there are some great courses there, but some were made before the new features from React, specially regarding functional components only. I would like to update my company's onboarding guides, and I think you guys might help.

I would like a complete course (made for beginners) that doesn't show hooks like "a new thing", but instead uses it as a de-facto solution. Thank you in advance.

## [12][How do you handle hundreds of API endpoints with cache invalidation and reload of data?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/emnqr6/how_do_you_handle_hundreds_of_api_endpoints_with/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/emnqr6/how_do_you_handle_hundreds_of_api_endpoints_with/

Hi!  


I have a general question about how people usually handle API Endpoint management for their react app. At work now we have a MongoDB with about 25 different models where each model has about 5-8 different endpoints for various things.  


What we want to achieve:

 \- We use TypeScript  
 \- Make requests to about 250 different endpoints  
 \- Cache all GET-request  
 \- Be able to clear cached request (should be able to clear per Model or ApiClient as we currently have, preferably by using Axios Cache Adapter)  
 \- Re-fetch the data that had its cache removed for those component that needs it.  


Currently we have a BaseApi class that have get, post, delete, put methods and then we have one class for each "Api group" or model in MongoDB. So for example we have a UserApiClient class that extends BaseApi and then have some methods like "activateUser" which makes a certain request and so on.  


We have been using a lot of hooks in our new setup but it feels "hacky" to create all async functions in hooks and wrap them in useCallback (not all, but some) because the method needs to be in the dependency array of useEffect if we want some function to run on mount.  


Then if i do a UserApiClient.clearCache() I want to maybe reload some data from the API in say BlogPostClient and if any component uses BlogPostClient.get() it should automatically make that fetch and update that components state.  


I have tried to find some projects on github or anywhere but it is hard to find a large project with this structure.   


Does anyone have some tips or guidance for me? Any help is appreciated
