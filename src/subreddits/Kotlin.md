I have been following the [Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers ](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011) course to learn Kotlin for Android development but after using C++ for quite some time but not really taking advantage of lamdas, generics and other modern features there are several features like interface delegation that don‚Äôt appear to be immediately relevant.

So is it worth trying to learn them at the beginning for Android development or can they be conveniently ignored until the need arises ?

Hi, recently I've been struggling to find a nice way to do my property system on a private project.  
The idea is to have a delegated property for example:

    val myBoolean by Property("Property name", true)

The problem is, I need to have sub property, contained inside of the delegation object (Property) and it should be easily accessible. The only workaround I found at the time is

    val subProperty by ::myBoolean.property("Sub property name", false)

But, I'm not a big fan of it... If you have any recommandations please tell me!

## [5][How to quickly search the first 1024 bytes in a ByteArray?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/g5iz54/how_to_quickly_search_the_first_1024_bytes_in_a/)

I need to search for a short ByteArray in the first 1024 bytes of a longer ByteArray, in a situation where performance is important.

For context, this is a Burp extension. It uses the IHttpListener interface to monitor every request/response. A small number of requests contain a particular header and need further processing. Because this touches every request and response, performance is important. I'd say that converting the ByteArray to a String or copying is definitely out. Ideally I'd like to invoke a native function.

Any ideas would be welcome!

I heard that the biggest reason to choose Kotlin is not because it is a "new language", but because it is a "better java"! 

So I think I need some advice
