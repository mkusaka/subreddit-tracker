To me, a dsl and a function call look very similar so why the pushback when one leaves parentheses out on a function call? I think it looks more readable but the style guide does not recommend it.

Hello everybody, I would like to share one of my projects with you!

This gem allows you to define "immutable" objects, and your objects will have only getters and no setters. So, if you change \[[1](https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes#with_attribute)\] \[[2](https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes#with_attributes)\] some object attribute, you will have a new object instance. That is, you transform the object instead of modifying it. 

Check out it [https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes](https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes).

I have just released a new gem called `capistrano-precompile-chooser`. It is a Capistrano plugin to precompile your Rails assets locally, remotely, or not at all provided with a very convenient default terminal prompt.

## [7][Best way to place words in a text file into an array?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ie06my/best_way_to_place_words_in_a_text_file_into_an/)

I am writing a program and I need to figure out the most efficient way to place words from a text file into an array that contains all the words from that text file.

I have this so far and it works, however it's not an array of words.

    def format_text(txt)
        text = File.read(txt)   
        form = text.downcase.gsub(/[a-z0-9\s]/i, '').strip.split(/.|?|!/) 
        puts form 
    end
    
    def generate_text(txt)     
        structure = format_text(txt)
        puts structure
    end
    
    print(generate_text('thefile.txt'))

Hello,

I recently wrote an article about an blog post (linked in the article) from a programmer who had moved from Ruby to Clojure and then back to Ruby, and why I thought some of the statements he had made about Clojure were wrong.

I posted it to the Clojure community, and they reasonably pointed out that I was unlikely to much valuable insight from preaching to the choir, and suggested I put it in front of some Ruby programmers. 

So here is [simple vs. easy](https://redpenguin101.github.io/posts/2020_08_18_simplevseasy.html). I'd appreciate any feedback you have.
