Hi, guys! My newest app uses the Spotify API to let you browse their genres and playlists to create your own playlist in the style of Tinder, the dating app. Songs that are swiped right, or "liked", are added to your Tindify playlist. This doesn't really have any practical uses, but I have seen some other people on this sub using the React Spring library and I wanted to incorporate it into a project. You need to have a Spotify account to use the app, but I've included a video for those that don't have one.

Live demo:  [https://tindify.netlify.app](https://tindify.netlify.app/login)

Github repos:  [https://github.com/ndeom/Tindify](https://github.com/ndeom/Tindify)  (main app)

[https://github.com/ndeom/Tindify-Auth](https://github.com/ndeom/Tindify-Auth) (authentication api for jwt's)

A few caveats: I am still relatively new to coding (\~8-9 months of self-teaching), so any/all constructive criticism with respect to architecture, good coding practices, style, implementation, features, etc. would be greatly appreciated, because my goal is to learn. This is also my first time using React hooks in a project, so the implementation might be a little messy in some places. There are likely areas of the app that could be refactored, and I'm in the process of adding tests with Jest and the React testing library.

That being said, I hope you'll take a look!

My college propose to use Material UI and I don't like the Material UI 'cause its performance issues. He insists about that and I'm proposing to use TailwindCSS ease of use and seems like less disadvantages from Material UI. What you guys thinking about React + TailwindCSS or Material UI ?
## [12][How much left to learn after learning the main concepts of ReactJS](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i8d312/how_much_left_to_learn_after_learning_the_main/)

How much of ReactJS would you say a person has completed after learning:

+ JSX

+ Rendering Elements

+ Components and Props

+ States and lifecycle 

+ Handling events

+ Conditional rendering 

+ Lists and keys

+ Forms

+ Composition vs inheritance 

+ Lifting State up

+ Hooks

After learning all of that can a person start to build react apps? Or are the additional things required or nice to have that can be learnt on the job?
