This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I'm trying to promote my weather forecast app. I thought buying motivated installs will do the trick. At the start, it seems it was working (37th position in Weather category, though without perceptible organic downloads). But after a couple of days, the app disappeared from ratings :(. So now I'm at the end of my wits - in order to have more downloads, an app needs to be ranked (or at least to be visible) but to be visible an app needs to have lots of downloads. A closed circle :)

If someone has any experience or any ideas how it's possible to lift an app from the sheer depth of Android market rating to where it will be at least visible somewhere

Thanks in advance

I love memes, thus I decided to make an Android app dedicated to the dankest memes. Here it is:Â https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ether.paul.lt.dankmemesphrases
However, I have received some negativity regarding colors of the app. What do you think, do I need to change colors and if yes, then which ones would be better?
