I see projects like Docker, Kubernetes, and a few other tools written in Go so I was just curious.

A project I'm working on requires using the Docker sdk extensively and I was considering if I should learn Go and use it instead of Python.

I made a TUI tool to operate golangci-lint intuitively.

A noteworthy feature is that you can open a file by specifying the issue line. Iâ€™d be happy if you could try it, and give me any feedback.

Just bought [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM) a few days ago, only been through the first few chapters but figured I would try applying it.

The least I can say is, it feels pretty good to crunch that big function! I can still see possible improvements (like create a `isTr(n *html.Node) { return isElement(n, "tr")}`), but I'm [pretty proud of it](https://github.com/nicolascouvrat/javaimports/commit/ffffd8a8a64580b75fa3e75aadfa5dc7c9416bd2).

Do you spot anything else I should improve there?

Hi, I've really just started using go seriously and I'm interested in people's opinions on best practices/common conventions in variable declarations. 

I have the following function which does exactly the same thing as far as I'm aware, but has a different syntax. Is there a preferred style that is more accepted among the go community?

Method 1:

```
// GetDb connects to the postgres database and returns a pointer to a gorm database object
func GetDb() *gorm.DB {
	var db *gorm.DB
	var dbURL string
	var err error
	var parsedURL *dburl.URL

	if dbURL = os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL"); dbURL == "" {
		dbURL = "postgresql://localhost/mydb?sslmode=disable"
	}

	if parsedURL, err = dburl.Parse(dbURL); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if db, err = gorm.Open("postgres", parsedURL.DSN); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	return db
}
```
Method 2:
```
// GetDb connects to the postgres database and returns a pointer to a gorm database object
func GetDb() *gorm.DB {

	dbURL := os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")

	if dbURL == "" {
		dbURL = "postgresql://localhost/mydb?sslmode=disable"
	}

	parsedURL, err := dburl.Parse(dbURL)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	db, err := gorm.Open("postgres", parsedURL.DSN)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	return db
}
```

From what I've seen, method 2 seems to be the more popular in tutorials but I personally find method 1 to be clearer.
