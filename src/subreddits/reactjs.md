Hey! I'm still fairly new to react and coding in general and am really looking to improve by doing some hands-on personal projects (and get out of tutorial hell!). So, what have been your favourite personal projects that aren't super advanced, but also not a To-Do app!
## [5][Plotting Code-Quality-metric changes of a React and a node repository over time](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ho2mbl/plotting_codequalitymetric_changes_of_a_react_and/)

Hey there,

For a project i need a tool that would go over a React (and a Node) repository and would analyze every commit in it using common code metrics like lines of code per file, cyclomatic complexity etc.

I want to create some graphs out of this data to show the changes over time.

While i found no immediate solution that could tackle this this specific problem i suspect you could write a bash script that utilizes ESLint somehow to output the data into a file.

So before i go down this road i wanted to ask if someone knows either a tool that does the job or a hint to a better way than i proposed.

Thanks for reading,

Have a great day!

## [11][üç™ A highly scalable, professional boilerplate for building fast, robust and adaptable mern web apps üöÄ](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ho0c8m/a_highly_scalable_professional_boilerplate_for/)

In programming, the term boilerplate code refers to blocks of code used over and over again

Let‚Äôs assume your development stack consists of several libraries, such as React, Babel, Express, Jest, Webpack, etc. When you start a new project, you initialize all these libraries and configure them to work with each other.

With every new project that you start, you will be repeating yourself. You could also introduce inconsistencies in how these libraries are set up in each project. This can cause confusion when you switch between projects.

This is where boilerplates come in. A boilerplate is a template that you can clone and reuse for every project.

CookieScript Boilerplate uses familiar tools and implements best practices around them to provide you a SOLID development experience. This project does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

Here are some of the awesome CookieScript features you'll enjoy

* ***Quick scaffolding***  
CookieScript offers a built-in tool for the command line is known as Geek which allows performing the majority of those tedious and repetitive programming tasks that many JavaScript developers avoid performing manually.
* ***Next generation JavaScript***  
Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.
* ***No Lock-In***  
Under the hood, we use webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects to power your app.
* ***SEO friendly***  
There are a few problems for search engine rankings when it comes to a vanilla \`React app\`. We follow best practices to make your web app attractive to \`Google\`.
* ***Authentication***  
Authentication is the most important factor in a web application, and developers need to spend a lot of time writing the authentication code. CookieScript contains an inbuilt authentication system, you only need to configure models, views, and controllers to make the application work.
