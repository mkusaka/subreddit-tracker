This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

My focus in this small project was to get MVVM right and separate the logic between the fragment and the ViewModel properly. In the past, I've been writing a lot of logic in my fragments and I'm trying to learn how to do that better.

I use Channels converted to Flow to emit events from my ViewModels for my fragments to listen to.

Can someone take a look at this project and give some feedback? Any big mistakes?

I need to show a toast just below the toolbar. It is a standard activity with no frills

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;override fun onCreateView(savedInstance: Bundle?) {  
&gt;  
&gt;super.onCreateView(savedBundle)  
&gt;  
&gt;setContentView(R.layout.my\_layout)  
&gt;  
&gt;val toast = Toast(this).apply {  
&gt;  
&gt;setGravity(Gravity.***TOP*** | Gravity.***CENTER\_HORIZONTAL***, 0, 0)setDuration(Toast.***LENGTH\_LONG***)  
&gt;  
&gt;show(R.string.success\_string)  
&gt;  
&gt;}  
&gt;  
&gt;. . . . . . . Other code in the function . . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;}

&amp;#x200B;

Activity definition in the manifest

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;&lt;**activity android:name=".activities.InputActivity"** /&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I have  `setGravity(Gravity.TOP | Gravity.CENTER_HORIZONTAL, 0, 0)`. I know that I can set the y offset but I don't know how the y offset should be calculated. The most relevant article on SO is from 2013. Any suggestions would be gratefully appreciated.

This is my second time building an app with android studio. I‚Äôm trying to build a currency conversion app that calls an API to do the conversion. However, when I run the app, I get the dexBuilderDebug error. I‚Äôm only getting this error after creating the interface and class for retrofit. 

I have my code and errors posted on [stackoverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64620823/android-studio-build-failed-task-appdexbuilderdebug-failed). Has anyone ran into the same error before? How did you fix it? I can‚Äôt even understand what is causing the error

Hi, I'm totally new to Android dev. I'm hoping someone can give me a brief roadmap on what I'm going to need to know to work effectively with Android Studio and C++ so I can start reading the right articles and so on. For example, do I need to know "normal" Java android-development for the NDK to make sense? Are there decent resources for learning C++ oriented Android dev that aren't out of date? Are all NDK apps hybrids where at some point I'm dealing with the JNI?

I'm mucking about with JUCE but I'm a big believer in understanding what your framework is doing and not developing more married to the framework than need be, so I feel I should be educating myself outside of just JUCE oriented resources.

Thanks!
## [9][Avoiding I/O in gradle ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jkyr0v/avoiding_io_in_gradle/)

I have seen some threads recommending that you avoid I/O during gradle configuration. My company currently does this to get the branch name, build time, and git SHA, into BuildConfig. I'm trying to understand the reasoning of why I should avoid it before I bring it up to my coworkers.

For these specific examples I replaced the git command with a static string, and did `./gradlew assemble* --dry-run --rerun-tasks --profile` and those configuration times dropped from around 3s to 1.5s. that's a nice percentage but not all that significant since that's only for configuration.

What else should I know? I have read some threads alluding to impacting incremental builds but can't find concrete info about why

I plan on releasing a paid app to the play store soon. I don‚Äôt really expect it to make me much more than beer money, so I‚Äôm not incorporating as an LLC or anything. 

I will be getting a separate gmail account though for the developer account. When I sign up for a new gmail address should it be a personal one since I‚Äôm just doing business as a sole proprietor (US based) or a business gmail account since I am selling something, which is a business transaction for the little it‚Äôll be worth?

Chrome seems to make almost every video that should have either black become light gray, or a value that should be 100% white becomes grey instead.
