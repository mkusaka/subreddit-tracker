Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

## [3][Boost.Nowide released](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/frnw7y/boostnowide_released/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/frnw7y/boostnowide_released/
---
Can be found in: [https://github.com/boostorg/nowide](https://github.com/boostorg/nowide)

**Boost.Nowide** is a new addition of the upcoming 1.73.0 Boost release which has been pending for a long time now. It is finally ready to be used!

**In short**:  It provides Standard library functions with UTF-8 API on Windows

So if you wanted to do cross-platform `std::fopen` or `std::ofstream` to open files by an UTF-8 encoded name but were hit by Windows using UTF-16 instead you can now simply use `boost::nowide::fopen` or `boost::nowide::ofstream` and have it handle all the conversions in the background.

There are also some custom functions for conversion of strings to interoperate with other WinAPI functions. In short: `boost::nowide::narrow` and `boost::nowide::widen` will convert your wide string to narrow (UTF-16 -&gt; UTF-8) and back.

The library has existed for a while now but contained some outright bugs and performance degradation. Those have been fixed now. On top there is CMake integration, support for use as a submodule (`add_subdirectory("path/to/nowide")`) and a standalone version which does not require Boost at all.

Note that the library is currently usable as a submodule with any Boost version of at least 1.56. So you don't have to wait for Boost 1.73 to be released.

Versioning: The library will get tags from the usual Boost releases but also has an internal version which adheres to semantic versioning. To differentiate that from the Boost build it starts at `10.0.0`.

I invite you to review the code, use it now and provide feedback!

I know boost can be used to serialise into text files or file types of that sort. 
Would you recommend it for XML? I would need to edit the XML itself and create objects directly from the new XML.
Or should I consider other libraries like [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/)?

Genya Murakami, aka Bolero Murakami was found dead in Feb 16th at his workshop. 32 years old. It seems he was working on his pottery art at night and suddenly died.

[https://www.facebook.com/100519794904313/photos/a.115722580050701/115721186717507/?type=3&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/100519794904313/photos/a.115722580050701/115721186717507/?type=3&amp;theater)

&amp;#x200B;

His tweet at Feb 15th 9:51 PM indicate that he felt pain on his back side of neck and head.

[https://twitter.com/bolero\_MURAKAMI/status/1228663003324661760](https://twitter.com/bolero_MURAKAMI/status/1228663003324661760)

&amp;#x200B;

He is the author of C++ library Sprout which is a C++ framework for general compile-time computation. It exploits template and constexpr so hard that some compiler vendor using it as a test case for their compiler implementation.

[https://github.com/bolero-MURAKAMI/Sprout](https://github.com/bolero-MURAKAMI/Sprout)

&amp;#x200B;

The notable works of him were C++ compile-time ray tracing using pure template metaprogramming and later using C++11 constexpr(Do you remember the day when constexpr fucntion can only contains one return statement?)

&amp;#x200B;

Or compile time sound synthesizer.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so sad for his loss and I can't even visit his workshop for the coronavirus situation.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I tell you the memory of Genya Murakami since I occasionally met him.

&amp;#x200B;

Genya Murakami, aka Bolero Murakami or 中3女子(literally, Junior High school 3rd grade student girl) was an exceptional man who lived in an exceptional life.

His parents are artists too. His father, 猪風来(Ifuurai), is a Jōmon artist, meaning, he express his art by the way of Jōmon period. Mostly, by Jōmon pottery.

Jōmon pottery is a traditional earthenware pottery, meaning it doesn't use kiln so it's fired in low temperature. The exact technique was lost but Ifuurai is the one of the researcher who rediscover the necessary techniques. Genya Murakami is the son of Ifuurai.

Ifuurai is a pretty extremest on his Jōmon art to the point that he thought, in order to truly understand the heart of Jōmon people, he must live like the way  Jōmon people did. So he built a Jōmon style dugout house in Hokkaido. He and his wife and Genya Murakami were living in that traditional dugout house until Genya's Junior high or high school. Then the family move to the Okayama prefecture. The building of closed public school was available so they turn that buildings to the workshop and museum for their works.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the fact that Genya Murakami live in an very strange life during his youth, he grow up, graduate public school like everybody else. After he graduate from a techinical school, he was working as a drafting engineer for a few years. But he thought "playing with the clay is more interesting than this", so he quit his job and follow the father's path.

&amp;#x200B;

As a pottery artist, he learned from his father the techniques of Jomon pottery, lately, he learned enough to create his own art.

&amp;#x200B;

People recognize him as a weird C++ programmer who exploits the template meta programming and constexpr, but his real life work was the Jomon pottery artist. Once, I asked him if the C++ is an art for him, he said "No, C++ is not an art for me. It's one of the things I enjoy doing it."

    last = (last + 1) % size;  
Is the line I'm referring to. This is in a college textbook discussing queues. And as far as I can tell there's no purpose. The variable `last` always starts as `-1` (so the result of this will be `0`) and there is no way for it to go past `size` so the moduli will never change the amount in `last` Correct?  

&amp;nbsp;

Is there something I'm missing?

My JSON parsing code compiled with msvc gets 315 megabytes per second, while the same code compiled with clang gets 412 megabytes per second.  msvc is consistently slower, why is that? And yes I have optimizations on...

There had been a couple of problems raised few years ago in regards to parallelizing the compilation process in modules being necessarily harder.


Since then, what happened? Any significant design changes merged to C++20 modules to tackle the problem raised?


Or do people that were pessimistic back then still think modules will be dead on arrival?
