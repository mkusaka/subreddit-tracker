Hi, 

I wrote the following code and I believe  that 

* if  `findById( id )` is successful then both the then should work  - Working Fine 
* if `findById( id` ) is rejected then both the catch should work - Not working fine

The **first catch is executed** (As I can see a 404 error straight away on screen) but the **second catch is not being executed** and nothing is being printed on screen.

**Why is it so?**

Thanks

So I got an exercise of school to make an house on a javascript canvas. So I made a design, so that I wouldn't get confused as easily while coding. Now I wanted to go and code it but wanted to ask you guys if there might be a better/easier option, an app, website or something like that.

The background of the picture looks like its already drawn on a javascript canvas but it isn't. I just put it in the drawing for help.

I'm learning api, and I'm having a problem with CORS . How can you get around that?

when i tests api in some client like Insomnia it works.

But when I want to display through fetch method, I get a CORS error

What can I do with it ? api is free and without the key required
