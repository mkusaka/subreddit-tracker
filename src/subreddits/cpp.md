Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Hi everyone!

I would like to present you a C++17 library that me and my friend were working on recently. The library is still very much WIP so any suggestions are welcome.

The main idea was to provide a more elegant functional API for containers processing. The API itself is heavily inspired by the way the Rust programming language deals with container processing and iterators.

If you have any suggestions or feedback do not hesitate to open issues/pull requests or reach out to us!

Hello guys!

I have been studying C++ for a while now, using it mainly as a command line tool to practice generics, OOP, networking etc.

Now I would like to go a step further and develop a GUI app with C++, just because I like the language.

So there are GTK, WxWidgets, QT and more... 

I have been researching which one might be as simple as it can be and good documentation to rely on.

Have any advice on which one to start with?

I made a small program (in C++) that converts English to braille , it runs perfectly in the IDE (VScode) and the output is in Braille but when I run it using the exe file, the cmd outputs some unicode characters.

    Given Sentence:
    I have 2 dogs. A pomeranian named "DODO" and labrador named "RIO". Dodo is 9 years old and Rio is 10 months old.
    
    Braille sentence (in cmd):
    ΓááΓáè ΓáôΓáüΓáºΓáæ Γá╝Γáâ ΓáÖΓáòΓá¢ΓáÄΓáá ΓááΓáü ΓáÅΓáòΓáìΓáæΓáùΓáüΓá¥ΓáèΓáüΓá¥ Γá¥ΓáüΓáìΓáæΓáÖ ΓáÿΓáªΓááΓáÖΓááΓáòΓááΓáÖΓááΓáòΓáÿΓáª ΓáüΓá¥ΓáÖ ΓáçΓáüΓáâΓáùΓáüΓáÖΓáòΓáù Γá¥ΓáüΓáìΓáæΓáÖ ΓáÿΓáªΓááΓáùΓááΓáèΓááΓáòΓáÿΓáªΓáá ΓááΓáÖΓáòΓáÖΓáò ΓáèΓáÄ Γá╝Γáè Γá╜ΓáæΓáüΓáùΓáÄ ΓáòΓáçΓáÖ ΓáüΓá¥ΓáÖ ΓááΓáùΓáèΓáò ΓáèΓáÄ Γá╝ΓáüΓá╝ΓáÜ ΓáìΓáòΓá¥Γá₧ΓáôΓáÄ

Just curious if anyone knows what the status of Library Fundamentals TS v3 is?

Particularly interested in scope\_exit/scope\_fail/scope\_success for easy RAII with C libraries.

## [10][Do C++ devs use MSSQL Server? If so, how are queries written?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jotz0p/do_c_devs_use_mssql_server_if_so_how_are_queries/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jotz0p/do_c_devs_use_mssql_server_if_so_how_are_queries/

I come from C# where .NET is nice enough to provide a [SQL client class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) for writing and running database queries. This is how I typically connect to a DB, issue a query, read the result:

    string cxnStr = "Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=BikeStore;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=dev1;Password=helloworld";
    string query = "SELECT Name,ID FROM BikeStore.dbo.Customer";
    using (var cxn = new SqlConnection(cxnStr))
    {
       cxn.Open();
       using (var cmd = new SqlCommand(query, cxn)) 
       {
          var rd = cmd.ExecuteReader(); // Executes the command; returns a reader object used to read the result set
          while (rd.Reader())
          {
             // The "rd" Reader object can be indexed. "as string" is a cast
             Console.WriteLine($"{rd["Name"] as string}"); // A format string in C#
          }
       }
    }

I was wondering if C++ libraries for interacting with databases work the same way i.e., write you query/connection info as a string, use a library call to run the query, cast the result the appropriate type before using it in your program.
