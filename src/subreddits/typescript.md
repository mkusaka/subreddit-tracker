## [4][TS2304 Can not find name "QuerySnapshot" (firebase-admin)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/eo416c/ts2304_can_not_find_name_querysnapshot/)

I'm importing firebase-admin and firebase-functions while working on some methods meant to interact with Firestore. 

The following code lints the title error however. I'm referencing this page when setting the data type of response: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.CollectionReference.html#get](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.CollectionReference.html#get)

        try {
          const response: Promise&lt;QuerySnapshot&lt;T&gt;&gt; = await db
            .collection("globalRules")
            .get();
          const globalRules = response.map((record: any) =&gt; record.data());
          
        }
        catch (e) {
          console.log(e, `=====error=====`);
        }

The firebase SDK comes with its own type definitions so why is QuerySnapshot not found? Removing the &lt;T&gt; doesn't help. Or the Promise&lt;&gt; syntax.

Hi All,

I have a small library for server-side-rendered websites I've been using for small projects on the past year. I decided to rewrite it properly with TypeScript ( add tests, create docs etc. ). My question is how to publish the library so it can be consumed as ES6 module ( ex. `import Component from "lib"` ) , TS module, ES5 package ready to be distributed via CDN ( ex. `&lt;script src="`[`cdnjs.com/lib.js`](https://cdnjs.com/lib.js)`" /&gt;`  \- dev version with source maps and production build ) and ship it all with type definitions? I'm using Webpack to dev/build. 

This will be my **first** public library and I'm looking for a minimal examples on well done publishing/build steps. I already searched on Github how other libraries do this, but all feels "hacky" ( ex. set TS target to ES6, then postbuild run babel to create ES5 code ).

What's the best library for the canvas element?

This it the first time I'm trying to use canvas in a website and I wanted to know if there are any good libraries out there (especially ones which work well with react).

Thxs in advance

## [9][How do I add Types to deconstructed object returned by a function?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/enauq1/how_do_i_add_types_to_deconstructed_object/)

I'm getting type definition error, but I'm not really sure how to add a type for this specific case. Normally, I would add an interface and assign the necessary types, but **I'm not sure how to add an interface to my deconstructed object from TimePickerAndroid.open()**. I've tried a few ways, but nothing seems to be working.

**Error:**

    src/DatePicker.tsx:47:15 - error TS2322: Type 'DatePickerAndroidOpenReturn' is not assignable to type 'Props'.
      Type 'DatePickerAndroidDateSetAction' is missing the following properties from type 'Props': title, onValueChange, mode, date47
    
    const { action, year, month, day } : Props = await DatePickerAndroid.open({

**Interface:**

    // TypeScript: Types
    interface Props {
      title: string,
      onValueChange: Function,
      mode: 'calendar' | 'spinner' | 'default' | undefined,
      action: 'dateSetAction' | 'dismissedAction',
      date: Date | undefined,
      minDate?: Date | undefined,
      maxDate?: Date | undefined,
      year?: number | Date,
      month?: number | Date,
      day?: number | Date,
    }

**TimePicker.tsx:**

      // Toggle Modal
      const toggleModal = async (props: Props) =&gt; {
        try {
          // Check Platform (iOS)
          if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
            // React Hook: Toggle Modal
            toggle((modalVisible) =&gt; !modalVisible);
          }
    
          // Check Platform (Android)
          if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
            const { action, hour, minute } = await TimePickerAndroid.open({
              hour: date.getHours(),
              minute: date.getMinutes(),
              is24Hour: false,
              mode: props.mode,
            });
    
            // Action: Time Set
            if (action === TimePickerAndroid.timeSetAction) {
              // New Date
              let newDate = date;
    
              // Set Hours
              newDate.setHours(hour);
    
              // Set Minutes
              newDate.setMinutes(minute);
    
              // Select Date
              await selectDate(newDate);
            }
    
            // Action: Dismissed
            if (action === TimePickerAndroid.dismissedAction) {
              // Do Nothing
            }
          }
        }
        catch (error) {
          console.log(error);
        }
      };

    const StackNavigator = createBottomTabNavigator({
        HomeScreen: {

    },
    },    
    {
        tabBarComponent: props =&gt; &lt;TabBarComponent {...props} /&gt; // errors out here
    }}

ERROR: 

`'TabBarComponent' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here.`

    Argument of type '{ tabBarComponent: (props: any) =&gt; boolean; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'CreateNavigatorConfig&lt;Partial&lt;Config&gt;, NavigationTabRouterConfig, Partial&lt;NavigationBottomTabOptions&gt;, NavigationTabProp&lt;...&gt;&gt;'.

**Can someone please explain why this is happening?** 

&amp;#x200B;

TabBarComponent.tsx

    const TabBarComponent = ({ navigation, ...data }) =&gt; {
    return &lt;View&gt; ... &lt;/View&gt;
    }
