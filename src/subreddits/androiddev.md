Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

For example, why is Spotify so far behind on android? There are useful features that we've been missing for years. I even saw a whole advertisement on Instagram specifically for Spotify's swipe to queue and save songs feature. (This feature is iOS only.) How can they blatantly and shamelessly neglect Android, or is there a reason? Yes I am a little salty

Hello!

I'm working on a app that has 3 buttons:

LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

Those buttons corresponds to CPU intensity, what would be the easiest way to create a CPU intensive task that can generate a low, medium and high load?

Thank you!

With the Coronavirus spreading like wildfire these days, a lot of people are helping each other. In my local community I see a lot of people helping elderly/sick people by cooking for them, warning them about regulations, running errands for them or just chatting with them from a distance because they are quarantined and have no social contact. I hope I'm not alone this, but I feel like I also need to help anyway I can. And I know can make/publish an Android app and write some reasonable code. There are/were a lot of apps spreading misinformation on this issue, hell some even put ads/premium functions on those apps. For that reason Google has [blocked](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-google-amazon-block-nonofficial-coronavirus-apps-from-app-stores/) all COVID-19 apps.

**So why not create a comprehensive open source COVID-19 app as a community?**

Considering there is a complete lack of a good map/overview app for this on the Play Store at the moment. Maybe if we do this as a collective with only official information from the WHO/NHC, Google might consider allowing this app to be available on the Play Store.

**Some requirements:**

* Confirmation from Google (yeah..)
* A list of contributors
* Someone who wants to lead this thing (or maybe a few people)
* Wireframes/Mockups
   * If you don't have a lot of experience with Android you can still contribute by creating Wireframes/mockups.

**Some things to setup:**

* A repository
* A Slack channel (or something else)
* Project overview (Kanban board)
* List of requirements
* List of things to implement (backlog)

I haven't really seen an open source app succeed on a subreddit before, so this is probably going to fail. But let's give this a try. Leave a comment if you want to help.

I know you all are being extra productive in this difficult time and have multiple mobile apps lined up to be released, so please don't upvote me too fast in excitement, let me pitch something first.

We made the daunting work of creating screenshots for GooglePlay a little bit more enjoyable. You might think, well, there were other ones already. Yes, we thought so too, but they didn't have the styles nor the devices we wanted and it's also cool to do the project yourself.

So do use our service if it comes handy in your next app. Go to [previewed.app](https://previewed.app), select a device, choose a style, upload a screenshot and whoalla, pretty PlayStore.

You end up with something that looks like

## [10][Handle Dynamic runtime overlays (RRO)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fpshxl/handle_dynamic_runtime_overlays_rro/)

Hi! I'm using Dynamic Runtime Overlays in my AOSP image, and I have a  problem with handling overlays. Each enable or disable of the overlay leads to restart of the every  application but without any onConfigurationChange received. I would like  to prevent some applications from restart such as map application to  avoid lengthy initialization process.

Thanks for help!
## [11][How does token flow work in android app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fpsg9y/how_does_token_flow_work_in_android_app/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fpsg9y/how_does_token_flow_work_in_android_app/

Is this how the token flow works?

1. Authenticate user
2. Get token
3. Enter android app content
4. On each request token is being sent in the request

Questions:

1. What if token is expired? Do I logout user and send him back to authentication screen?
2. If user is already logged in, and he enters app second time, do I validate user with previously stored token?
3. Do I use some crypto tools to obfuscate token before storing it on the device?

Maven seems to be down almost every day at least once. How can I force Android Studio to not check this on every build?
