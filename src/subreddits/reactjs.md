We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

The AppBar component for instance doesn't cover the whole area by default, I looked through the documentation and on google but couldn't find a solution for it.

I also tried changing the spacing in createMuiTheme for my Layout component which included the AppBar and {props.children} at the end. That didn't seem to do anything.

Tl;dr : I want the app bar and all the other components to cover the whole screen, use the whole screen as a flex without padding which material-ui seems to be adding to it by default.

## [5][Architecture of a react application](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gnstyb/architecture_of_a_react_application/)

Hello all!

I was in an interview recently and was asked to sketch out an architectural design of a react application.

I really didn't know what to sketch out.

Are there any tools or resources that you know of or there where I could find out more about this?

The organisation that interviewed me were very back end heavy and kept asking about design patterns in React as well. AFAIK when you talk about design patterns in React it is more concerned with the visual patterns such as grids, cards etc than software patterns.

I have some experience with redux so can see how redux containers implement provider/consumer but are they thinking about it in the wrong way? In so much that they are trying to force software engineering principles onto a discipline that they do not really apply to?

Three years ago I was looking for a way to separate business logic from the presentation layer.

I want to send some kind of events from my components (I use React now), and implement all logic in another place (ex.: model). My view layer should know nothing about model implementation details.

Now I have 1+ years of experience in Effector. You should give a try with effector: [https://github.com/zerobias/effector](https://github.com/zerobias/effector)

Hi, I've wondering in the past few days about if should start using ant design pro in production knowing that I've been using ant design now for a while, but this dashboard scaffolding looks somehow amazing but what I don't find appealing is the use of dva and umijs in which both of them not well documented well and mostly in Chinese, so guys if you have experience with it please advice me here , plus I'm looking forward to find people to hire with such expertises.

Hi all, I've been having a big problem with the create-react-app that has stopped me in my tracks. I'm new to React (and coding in general) and I don't want this to be what stops me from going forward. I've posted my error and the package.json file below:

## [10][Is there a way for an input to use all props passed to it from a parent component?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gnugg8/is_there_a_way_for_an_input_to_use_all_props/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gnugg8/is_there_a_way_for_an_input_to_use_all_props/
---
I have a `SearchBar` component:

    interface Props {
      placeholder?: string;
      ariaLabel?: string;
      type?: string;
      onSearchTextChanged: (text: string) =&gt; void;
    }

    const SearchBar = ({ onSearchTextChanged, placeholder, ariaLabel, type }: Props) =&gt; {
      const [inputText, setInputText] = useState('');
    
      const onTextChanged = (e: React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;) =&gt; {
         onSearchTextChanged(e.target.value);
      };
    
      return &lt;input onChange={onTextChanged} placeholder={placeholder} aria-label={ariaLabel} type={type}&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;;
    };

&amp;nbsp;

You can see that `placeholder`, `ariaLabel` and `type` are passed as props which I then map to the standard input element attributes. I was wondering if there was a way to avoid having to specify these so that anyone using this component can use out of the box attributes supported by the `&lt;input&gt;` element. Sort of like `props.children` or `...rest`. Essentially I'd like to be able to use the `SearchBar` component like so:

&amp;nbsp;

`&lt;SearchBar placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search events" type="search" /&gt;`

&amp;nbsp;

and then inside the component use input like so:

&amp;nbsp;

`&lt;input {...allPropsGoHere} /&gt;`

So I know what Webpack is and what it's used for. However, as a React nube, I have no clue why I should care, since I just run create-react-app, code my app, run npm build and deploy that shit. The things is in a few interviews I have been asked about "Webpack Config" and have no clue how I'm supposed to respond to that. Is it ever necessary to "config" webpack if using create-react-app? Or perhaps some folks don't use create-react-app?
