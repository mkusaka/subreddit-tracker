We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

I am just messing around with typescript and react-apollo for the first time. I have a component

import React from 'react'  
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'  
import { trailCount, trailCountVariables } from './\_\_generated\_\_/trailCount'  
import { TrailStatus } from '../../\_\_generated\_\_/globalTypes'  
export const TRAIL\_COUNT = gql\`  
query trailCount($status: TrailStatus) {  
trailCount(status: $status)  
}  
\`  
export const Mountains: any = () =&gt; {  
const { data, loading, error } = useQuery&lt;trailCount, trailCountVariables&gt;(TRAIL\_COUNT, {  
variables: { status: TrailStatus.OPEN }  
})  
if (loading) return &lt;div&gt;Grabing Trail Info&lt;/div&gt;  
if (error) return console.error(error)  
return &lt;div&gt;{data?.trailCount}&lt;/div&gt;

}

1.) The types for the query and the queryVariables were auto generated by the apollo-codegen tool, and it generated `import { TrailStatus } from '../../__generated__/globalTypes'` outside of the project src/ directory which failed at compiled time because it wasn't within src/. I added the same file to src/ and it worked, but is this a problem with apollo or am I doing something wrong?

2.) The Function Component Mountains I typed as any because I couldn't figure out  what type it should be. How should I type function components that will have apollo queries and mutations?

3.) Why does the Mountains component have to return data?.trailCount and not trailCount?

4.) Are there any resources out there that I'm not finding that will help me through this? I'm having trouble finding resources that help me with typescript+apollo+hooks/Function Components.

Im trying to render the last value of a string in a div, using this.handleFormula function. Im assigning this function to formula in this.state and linking this.state.formula to a div. Im trying to console.log the return value but still nothing is rendering, do you what could be the issue?

here is my codepen: [https://codepen.io/tonytony92/pen/bGdmbzx?editors=1111](https://codepen.io/tonytony92/pen/bGdmbzx?editors=1111)

       this.state={
          display:"0",
          formula:this.handleFormula,
          buttonState:[{key: 'AC',
            col:'red',
            key1:"AC"
            },///and a bunch of other objects in array/// ]  }
    
    handleFormula(){
        let str=this.state.display
        console.log(str)
        let newArr=str.match(/["/"+"x"-]/gi)
        let newStr=""
        if (Boolean(newArr)==false){//If no special characters are found in string ,return current display//
          console.log(str)
          return str
        }
        else{
           for(let i=newArr.length-1;i&gt;-1;i--){// if last value is a number concatenate it to a variable///
            if(parseFloat(newArr[i])!==NaN){
                 newStr+=newArr[i]
               } 
             else if(i===newArr.length-1&amp;&amp; parseFloat(newArr[i])===NaN){ // if last value is a specialChar return it///
               return newArr[i]
             }
             else{  /// return numbers concatenated in variable///
               return newStr
             }
           }
        }

Hello friends!

I was looking at some Next.js PWA boilerplates and even tho there are some really good ones like [NextSimpleStarter](https://github.com/ooade/NextSimpleStarter), it didn't use Redux Toolkit or Styled Components. So I cloned NextSimpleStarter and tweaked it so it uses mentioned libraries. It is a good resource for everyone who wants to learn about how to implement those libraries into next.js project.

I built a simple todo app (did you expect something else for real?) and styling is complete garbage, feel free to edit it however you want!

Link to the repo:  [https://github.com/trujic1000/next-pwa-boilerplate](https://github.com/trujic1000/next-pwa-boilerplate) 

Live version:  [https://next-pwa.netlify.com/](https://next-pwa.netlify.com/) 

Happy coding!

so I had a function `func` that I needed to pass down through three components. the function would return `some-data` and push it to some array in Component1's state.

The first component was a class. The second component was a class. The third component was a function. I passed the function from Component1 to Component2 as you normally would:`&lt;Component2 func={this.func}&gt;`. Then Class 2 received the prop as a class would normally receive a property `constructor({func}){this.func = func}`. Then from Component2 to component 3 it was rendered: `&lt;Component3 func={this.func}&gt;`. Now component3 isnt a class, it's a function, so i received it as `const component3 = ({func}) =&gt;` before using it as `(&lt;a onClick={func(some-data)}&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;);`

Now this totally worked fine. the function would return `some-data` and push it to an array in Component1's state.

Until someone refactored Component1 to a function and used hooks. Then Component1's hooks would always reset to its initial state every time Component3 was clicked so it would only store an array of one `some-data`, instead of array of many `some-data`. THEN I had to change Component2's constructor as `constructor(props){super(props)}` or the hook state kept reverting to its initial state instead of some-data.

Does anyone know why this is?

I can write out code but i thought I'd try to give you as little code to look at as possible.
