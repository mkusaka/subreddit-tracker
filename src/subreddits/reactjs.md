We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [11][Help creating a 'NotificationBadge' component](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g30sg3/help_creating_a_notificationbadge_component/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g30sg3/help_creating_a_notificationbadge_component/
---
As the title suggests, I've been trying to create a component which serves as a wrapper around its children, and will render a badge in the top right corner of its top-level child.

The component so far, and an [example of what I'm trying to achieve](https://www.smartlauncher.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rect4559.png):

    export interface IndicatorProps {
        text?: string;
        children: React.ReactNode;
        containerClassName?: string;
        indicatorClassName?: string;
        indicatorStyle?: React.CSSProperties;
    }
    
    export const Indicator = (props: IndicatorProps) =&gt; {
        const { children, indicatorClassName, indicatorStyle, containerClassName, text } = props;
        const containerClass = classnames("relative", containerClassName);
        const indicatorClass = classnames("indicator z-10 absolute", indicatorClassName);
    
        return (
            &lt;div className={containerClass}&gt;
                {children}
                &lt;i style={indicatorStyle} className={indicatorClass}&gt;
                    {text}
                &lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    };        


Style:

    .indicator {
        border-radius: 50%;
        box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
        color: white;
        font-size: 10px;
        line-height: 1rem;
        height: 1rem;
        width: 1rem;
        top: -20%;
        right: -20%;
        text-align: center;
    }

The code so far is a bit misleading, but it's as far as I've gotten in trying to achieve my goal component.

Ideally I'd like to be able to do as follows: `&lt;Indicator someProps={...}&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have a notification badge in my top-right corner&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/Indicator&gt;`

Unfortunately as it stands my current code breaks when the child div is absolutely positioned, and requires that I pass any of the classnames/styling to the child div to the Indicator instead.

If what I've written isn't very coherent or requires further explaining, please let me know I understand that I've gone on a bit of a ramble here.

Thank you for any help you can give me.
