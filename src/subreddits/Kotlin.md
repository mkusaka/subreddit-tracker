I have very small exp with java/kotlin, all I tried in the past was a classic spring boot with its own jpa and so on  

Given that, I'm currently trying to choose the libraries to use for an asynchronous graphql server with a code first approach,  I'm looking for some tips

Is expedia/graphql-kotlin good or are there alternatives?  
Which web framework should I use? Spring or spark/other?  
I don't really understand how asynchronous database access works (I'm used to node where everything is async u know). It is not enabled by default while using hibernate/any jdbc right, what am I supposed to use?

Secondary: logging and validation libs suggestions

Thanks for the help

EDIT NON RELATED QUESTION: Is it fine using Apache Spark in kotlin or does it have any downside compared to java?

Hi everyone!

I'm trying to do one of the hyperskill's kotlin courses, but it seems like there's some issues with their config and/or my jdk version.

I've selected one of the projects from the edutools and idea set it up and installed everything. When I press "check", though, I always get build errors.

I've tried different jdk settings with no luck (changing the gradle jvm seems to make no difference at all):

\- JDK 1.8 =&gt; Could not target platform: 'Java SE 11' using tool chain: 'JDK 8 (1.8)'

\- 14 =&gt; java.lang.noClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.vmplugin.VMPluginFactory

\- openjdk-14 =&gt; Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.InvokerHelper

\- kotlin-sdk 1.4 =&gt; JAVA\_HOME is set to an invalid directory

&amp;#x200B;

If I create a kotlin project from scratch everything works fine (and it selects the openjdk-14 automatically).

Hello, i am struggling deploying ktor app to Heroku, i followed the documentation but no success. The problem is when i run 'git push heroku master' and i keep getting the same error(the error below). I have tried every solution i found on net but no success. Any suggestions? Btw. I have added a global variable ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and also the sdk.dir shows the right path of my sdk.

SDK location not found. Define location with an ANDROID_SDK_ROOT enviroment variabkr or by setting the sdk.dir in your project's local.properties file at 'tmp/build_b06419f6/local.properties'

Hey all,

I've been looking for a clean solution to mandatory parameters in Kotlin DSL.

Ended up writing a linter for it, tell me what you guys think

I am a pac-man generation programmer in a F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon - said to use advanced AI)  world. 

As I am learning the KorGE Game Library I am continually running across new terms like H.U.D.  (Heads Up Display, you knew that right?) and 'Roguelike'.   Thing is I'm designing a game while I have spent very little time playing them.  

Would somebody here care to recommend a book, a online course, a forum, or someway to bootstrap myself into the world of games?   (As developer, with commercialization in mind, not as a player.)

This came up in a couple of archived posts here, so I'm excited to say that `ktfmt` now has an IntelliJ plugin (as well as a Spotless plugin).

Also, a lot has changed in `ktfmt` since it was announced ~8 months ago - give it a try! we're listening for feedback over at https://github.com/facebookincubator/ktfmt/issues :)
