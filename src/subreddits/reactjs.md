We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I'm currently developing a personal project that has grown quite a bit over the past months, using React + Django REST. Now, here's how I write React: if a component needs state, I make it a class, if it's a simple widget, I make it a function, and that's it. I'm feeling kinda guilty for not using any of the "advanced" features. No HOCs, no hooks, no context or Redux or whatever, and so far everything works great, even though the complexity has increased quite a bit. Anyone else experiencing the same feeling?

I've been primarily a WordPress theme developer for the last 6 years and have been struggling to find the time to learn React over the last year.  What finally pushed me across the threshold was that recently, I had a number of projects that I decided to use React for.  One of them was [Linda Jean's Restaurant's website](https://lindajeansrestaurantmv.com), which was always meant to be a WordPress site, but I got my feet wet with Frontity in order to use lightning fast React and Vercel deployments.  Full write up [here](https://community.frontity.org/t/linda-jeans-restaurant-website/2516).  Let me know what you think!

This is my first ever post about React on my new site (made with Gatsby).

Shows you how to make a navbar that slides up and off the screen as the user scrolls down - this is common especially on good news/blogs sites as it makes for a better user experience when a site has a lot of readable content.

Hi guys,

I'm a newbie developing in Reactjs, I wonder how can I use the "faster" feature of animate.css in react?

    import { bounce } from 'react-animations';
    import { StyleSheet, css } from 'aphrodite';
    
    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
        bounce: {
            animationName: bounce,
            animationDuration: '3s',
            animationDelay: '0s',
        }
    })
    
     &lt;div className={css(styles.bounce)}&gt;
                        &lt;img src={require('../../assets/StreamNow.png')} alt="Stream Now Logo" style={{ height: '85px', marginLeft: '50px' }} /&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;

Thanks in advance for helping me out.

Hi everybody, I want to test stripe webhooks in my local windows dev machine, stripe docs mention stripe CLI as the best /easier way to test webhooks endpoints and sending fake events, I followed the docs to down load stripe CLI into my windows machine, I extracted the executable into my desktop but now I don't know how to properly excute commands in my cmd.

stripe.exe in my desktop, I first tried just simply clicking it, command prompt opened and showed message bellow, after a few seconds the command prompt closes.

```
This is a command line tool.

You need to open cmd.exe and run it from there.
```

After that I tried opening a CMD window and drag and dropping stripe.exe into the tab, I get the following list  of commands:

```
C:\Users\GABRIEL&gt;C:\Users\GABRIEL\Desktop\stripe.exe
The official command-line tool to interact with Stripe.

Before using the CLI, you'll need to login:

  $ stripe login

If you're working on multiple projects, you can run the login command with the
--project-name flag:

  $ stripe login --project-name rocket-rides

Usage:
  stripe [command]

Webhook commands:
  listen                        Listen for webhook events
  trigger                       Trigger test webhook events

Stripe commands:
  logs                          Interact with Stripe API request logs
  status                        Check the status of the Stripe API

Resource commands:
  get                           Quickly retrieve resources from Stripe
  charges                       Make requests (capture, create, list, etc) on charges
  customers                     Make requests (create, delete, list, etc) on customers
  payment_intents               Make requests (cancel, capture, confirm, etc) on payment intents
  ...                           To see more resource commands, run `stripe resources help`

Other commands:
  completion                    Generate bash and zsh completion scripts
  config                        Manually change the config values for the CLI
  feedback                      Provide us with feedback on the CLI
  fixtures                      Run fixtures to populate your account with data
  help                          Help about any command
  login                         Login to your Stripe account
  logout                        Logout of your Stripe account
  open                          Quickly open Stripe pages
  samples                       Sample integrations built by Stripe
  serve                         Serve static files locally
  version                       Get the version of the Stripe CLI

Flags:
      --api-key string        Your API key to use for the command
      --color string          turn on/off color output (on, off, auto)
      --config string         config file (default is
                              $HOME/.config/stripe/config.toml)
      --device-name string    device name
  -h, --help                  help for stripe
      --log-level string      log level (debug, info, warn, error)
                              (default "info")
  -p, --project-name string   the project name to read from for config
                              (default "default")
  -v, --version               Get the version of the Stripe CLI

Use "stripe [command] --help" for more information about a command.

C:\Users\GABRIEL&gt;
```
as you see I can't type any command, something like
```
stripe login
```

I'm left with no option to do anything with stripe cli in  cmd... please help me out

Been working full time as a react developer for four years. I really want to take my skills to the next level and have been thinking about contributing to open source projects.   


But I don't know where to start and thought maybe people here would have tips and ideas and their experience of working with other people on open source projects.
## [10][React Native: Modal or react-navigation for showing modals](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i1r4qg/react_native_modal_or_reactnavigation_for_showing/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i1r4qg/react_native_modal_or_reactnavigation_for_showing/

native, Modal is like a pop up which obscures everything bellow, according to react navigation docs in order to show your full screen/or not modals you can make use of nested navigators and mode prop in navigator:

https://reactnavigation.org/docs/modal/

Recently I just found there's also the Modal react-native component, so my question is, what should I use for modals? Navigate to them or isVisible prop with Modal element. For now I think I'll use navigation for more native feel but I wanted to know what you guys think.

Hey all, 

I've been learning react for a bit and I'm getting pretty comfortable reading (some) other people's code from maybe a git repo that interested me etc. But, I realize that most devs are always learning. My question is, outside of building you own projects, if you had a breakthrough that really improved the pace at which you learned, what was it?
