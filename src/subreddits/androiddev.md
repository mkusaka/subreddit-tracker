This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

I have heard and read so many reddit posts on indie developers who have had their apps banned due to being remotely close with certain other apps in look and feel. Going with that logic, why is the Jio meet and Jio chat not banned? They look and function as total ripoffs.
Is google against indie developers and they bow down to big organisations?

Maybe sounds insignificant if you compare with video reproductions or a post likes on twitter. But isn’t, the project is among top 10 github projects in Kotlin related with Android Architecture Sample with several mentions/references like Android Weekly, AndroidSweets, Droidcon and KotlinBy.

I want to say thank you ❤️   in this way for all the support received by the android/kotlin developer community and I hope that some of the architecture decisions taken help you to apply/inspire to your current or next project.

Of course, nothing is perfect and this project isn’t an exception, there are a lot of things to improve, but the iteration is the key to my point of view.

## [7][Make Recyclerview more fluid when populating with items](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ho1aeg/make_recyclerview_more_fluid_when_populating_with/)

I have already asked on SO but didnt get any response so I thought to try my luck here. 

I have a recyclerview with a grid layout which I populate with data from a local database. The problem that occurs is that when there is roughly more 20 items comming back as a result a lag occurs when populating the recyclerview. I am using all the stuff recommended by google, but cant get past this lag (the lag comes when I submit the list to the recyclerview, the data from the database comes fast) 

I have stripped down my list item to just one TextView, but the lag is still there (so it can't be because of a too complex layout).  I should say that the Recyclerview is inside a Nestedscrollview.

Here is a video with the issue:  [https://streamable.com/jdjdwi](https://streamable.com/jdjdwi) 

And if some is interested in all the details:  [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62757066/recyclerview-blocks-ui-when-setting-up-items](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62757066/recyclerview-blocks-ui-when-setting-up-items) 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to somehow "prepopulate" the recyclerview with the right number of empty items and then somehow fill the data async? I am somehow stuck here because I don't see how I can move past the main thread to fill the recyclerview.

Hi,
I have noticed one thing since last few months. Whenever i update my app google drops the position of the app in the play store ranking and after 1,2 days app comes back to it's original position.

Did you also noticed it? Why it is happening?

I cannot get an emulator with API 30 to work. I've tried all the system images for API 30 (x86, x64, Google Play, Google APIs and combinations). It always crashes right away with this error message.

I've tried another PC with a fresh install of Android Studio via JetBrains Toolbox but I get the same error. Any ideas?
