Howdy folks,  


I recently rewrote my PHP website in React and am super happy with the results. React is so nice to write and my code feels a lot more modular and flexible.  


I thought I'd ask for a code review here so others could point out things I did wrong or possible improvements to make. Just let me know as I'm looking to improve my work.  


Thanks!

## [8][How to pass a react dropdown npm package into a knockout-react binder which utilize custom element tag?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hoolnk/how_to_pass_a_react_dropdown_npm_package_into_a/)

Hi,

Lets say I want to pass a npm package dropdown,

How can I pass it into the component in "component" if I use a custom element tag such as 

    &lt;container component="npm package" props={}&gt;

 Here is the actually binding handler.

    ko.bindingHandlers.react = {  
        ko.register("container");   
        init() { return {controlsDescendantBindings: true}; },     
        update(element, valueAccessor) { const {component, props} = valueAccessor();                        ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(component, props), element); } 
    
    };
## [9][React router dom and React Material UI tabs...](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hoohgw/react_router_dom_and_react_material_ui_tabs/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hoohgw/react_router_dom_and_react_material_ui_tabs/

I'm using React material UI with react router dom and I'm not sure if I solved this issue correctly.

Let me share the code first.

This part is used in AppBar  and it represents the main menu via Tabs:

    &lt;Tabs
    	value={value}
    	onChange={handleChange}
    	aria-label="Meni"
    	variant="scrollable"
    	scrollButtons="on"&gt;
    	{routes.map(({ label, path }, i) =&gt; (
    		&lt;Tab key={i} label={label} component={Link} to={path} /&gt;
    	))}
    &lt;/Tabs&gt;

As evident, I have an array of routes, all having the label, path, component etc. properties and I'm foreaching them so that the meanu can be dynamically generated.

When the user switches between tabs, the index of the tab is passed (handleChange) - that's how Material UI tabs work.

    const handleChange = (_, newValue) =&gt; {
    	setValue(newValue);
    };

Now as long as the user is clicking the tabs, it all works perfectly fine. 

However, when I encounter a path where any kind of redirect is encountered, naturally, the tab is not selected. Here's an example:

    export default function PrivateRoute({ children, ...rest }) {
    	return (
    		&lt;Route
    			{...rest}
    			render={({ location }) =&gt;
    				fakeAuth.isAuthenticated ? (
    					children
    				) : (
    					&lt;Redirect
    						to={{
    							pathname: '/',
    							state: { from: location },
    						}}
    					/&gt;
    				)
    			}
    		/&gt;
    	);
    }
    

So my current solution is as follows. Since the state is passed in the case of redirect, I can use that in the useEffect part of the main component. So, if the state is not undefined, we can assume that some kind of redirection took place. Additionally, I'm using a function that gets the index of the currently selected path, so that the appropriate tabs can be selected.

Here's the code:

    export default function Main() {
    	const classes = useStyles();
    	const location = useLocation();
    	const routeIndex = useMemo(
    		() =&gt; routes.findIndex(({ path }) =&gt; path === location.pathname),
    		[location.pathname]
    	);
    	const [value, setValue] = useState(() =&gt; {
    		return routeIndex &gt; -1 ? routeIndex : false;
    	});
    
    	// ! useEffect for redirect-to cases.
    	// TODO: any other way?
    	useEffect(() =&gt; {
    		if (location.state !== undefined) {
    			if (routeIndex &gt; -1) setValue(routeIndex);
    		}
    	}, [location, routeIndex]);
    
    	const handleChange = (_, newValue) =&gt; {
    		setValue(newValue);
    	};
    
    	return (...

Again, this works perfectly fine, but it feels hack-ish.

So I was wondering if there's any other way to call setValue (in order to set the value of the selected tab) than to hack it in useEffect?

Thanks for any kind of feedback!
