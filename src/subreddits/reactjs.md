Hello everyone,

I don't know if it's just me by I feel like my pages load slow on Reactjs. I recently switched from create-react-app with react-router to nextjs. I never had a problem like this with react-router. The pages can take up to 2 seconds to switch, rather with react-router, they would be loaded as soon as it is requested. Is there something that I doing that might cause this delay?

Thanks
## [7][Best practice of how to structure a shared module/code lib between frontend and backend](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hqc5t4/best_practice_of_how_to_structure_a_shared/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hqc5t4/best_practice_of_how_to_structure_a_shared/
---
I have a `shared` module in my monorepo which is just an unpublished folder next to my modules for my frontend and backend, It just contains classes for validation both for the backend and frontend.

How to a structure this `shared` module now? Just putting all files into that folder with one `index.ts` like following snippet?
```
import SomeClass from './SomeClass.ts'
import SomeClass2 from './SomeClass2.ts'
import SomeClass3 from './SomeClass3.ts'
...

export SomecClass
export SomecClass2
export SomecClass2
...
```
There must be a better way with less DRY or not? FYI, somehow the TypeScript Compilers complains if I try to just `import SomeClass2 from 'shared/SomeClass2'` directly skipping `index.ts`.

**Edit:**
Easiest solution I found till now:
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-export-ns-from

```
export * from SomeClass
export * from SomeClass2
export * from SomeClass3
```
And look the exports/imports are symmetrical in terms of default or not.

## [10][mkcomp - highly configurable cli tool to scaffold react component folders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hqbjxt/mkcomp_highly_configurable_cli_tool_to_scaffold/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hqbjxt/mkcomp_highly_configurable_cli_tool_to_scaffold/
---
Just published my first npm package at [https://npmjs.com/package/mkcomp](https://t.co/bmWeb8Esbx?amp=1)

it's a CLI tool for react that lets you easily scaffold component folders.   Idea came after I started a new project and I realized I have to manually create so many component folders, test files, style files... boring!

so I got a little sidetracked and made a cli tool to do just that! highly configurable - you can set if you want it to generate ts/js files, if the extension for react components should be tsx/ts/jsx/js, if it should generate test files and where, if you want style or index file. 

&amp;#x200B;

 install it globally so you can access it everywhere. Run \`mkcomp --init {name}\` to set it up. then just do \`mkcomp FirstComponent -p src/components\`. It will automagically create the folders recursively and the files according to what you configured it. 

 oh yeah! and it also supports multiple profiles. So, if you have a project running on typescript and another on javascript, just create another profile \`mkcomp --init javascript\`, set it up with javascript config and done! You can switch between profiles: \`mkcomp --switch | -sw\`

Hello people! I'm wondering if there's any tutorial guides or npm package that gives a visual representation of user's daily check-ins. For example, Github has this small section on a user's profile page that shows how many commits a user has made throughout the year. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
## [12][Should I use styled-component with css module(SCSS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hqdmyg/should_i_use_styledcomponent_with_css_modulescss/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hqdmyg/should_i_use_styledcomponent_with_css_modulescss/
---
I used to use css module in react projects, recently I found some feature is hard to be implemented by css module and easy by styled-components. On the other hand, I found in most of cases, css module is still easier for me. Can I use styled components with css module , or should I just use one of them in a project?
