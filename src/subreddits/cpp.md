**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

## [3][Making an app to get a job](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g0c6m3/making_an_app_to_get_a_job/)

Let me give you a short version of my background.

My major is Master's in Chem eng &amp; Chemistry. I frankly didn't want to go to chemistry/chem eng field but I was kind of forced to go to this industry since my dad was so adamant on it.

I always wanted to do something with computer software development or games. Now that I have a job, I really do not want to stay in this field for the rest of my life. Even though I'm in my 30's I want to change my career. I'm learning C++ on my own and my plan in near future is to make a simple game or an app and using that as my resume. 

In your professional field, is this enough to get you a job? or do you need much more than that? 

And also, how would you rate the importance of optimization like in terms of Olog(n)? 

Any inputs are appreciated. Happy coding!

I am curious to know if there has been any conversations about supporting type erasure in constexpr for C++23. Specifically, we need a way to support std::function in a constexpr, or something similar (delegate?). We have everything we need minus type erasure.

According to cppreference.com, std::sort "Sorts the elements in the range in ascending order".

Why then, does it give different results depending on whether begin()/end() is used over rbegin()/rend()? The first sorts ascending and the second sorts descending.

Why does the direction of iterating over the elements in the range matter?

## [10][`std::unique_ptr` and braced initialization](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g05m1r/stdunique_ptr_and_braced_initialization/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g05m1r/stdunique_ptr_and_braced_initialization/
---
I was wondering if I am reinventing the wheel, or if this utility already exists. It seems easy to make something like `std::make_unique()` work with all forms of C++ initialization.

Today, it works only with parenthesis. For instance, consider `vector&lt;int&gt;(4,0)` vs `vector&lt;int&gt;{1,2,3,4}`.

    return std::make_unique&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;(4, 0);  // works fine.
    // vs.
    return std::make_unique(std::vector&lt;int&gt;{1, 2, 3, 4});  // error

[Godbolt link](https://godbolt.org/z/m33HJT).

C++20 designated initializers are also incompatible with `std::make_unique()` (e.g. `MyType{.foo = ...}`). We can directly use `std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T{...})` directly, but that has obvious verbosity issues with the type having to be specified twice. It seems this all can be solved by simply using a non-variadic version of `std::make_unique()`:

    template &lt;class T&gt;
    std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; move_to_unique(T&amp; t) {
      return std::make_unique&lt;T&gt;(std::move(t));
    }
    
    template &lt;class T&gt;
    std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; move_to_unique(T&amp;&amp; t) {
      return std::make_unique&lt;T&gt;(std::move(t));
    }

Now all of the following works pretty uniformly:

    return move_to_unique(std::vector&lt;int&gt;(4, 0));
    return move_to_unique(std::vector&lt;int&gt;{1, 2, 3, 4});
    return move_to_unique(MyType{.foo = 3, .bar = "hello world"});

[Godbolt link](https://godbolt.org/z/KUWbaZ)

Does this utility already exist? Am I missing some corner case, or is there a case where this will have surprising behavior?

If it doesn't exist, and given how *really* short it is, can I do something to get it into the standard library?

I would love some feedback!

## Addendum1

I suppose something like this can also be achieved by using template deduction guides for `std::unique_ptr`, but I didn't try it (since it's harder to experiment in Godbolt).

## Addendum2

The reason I have an l-value reference type as well is because I wanted to use it in these situations:

    // We are forced to use unique_ptr for recursive sum types.
    using AstNode = std::variant&lt;
       std::unique_ptr&lt;Expr&gt;,
       std::unique_ptr&lt;Stmt&gt;,
       ...&gt;;
    
    AstNode parseExpr(std::string input) {
       Expr result;
       // Modify result based on input.
       return move_to_unique(result);
    }

To reduce my own cognitive load, I didn't want to have to think about when to use an r-value-ref-only function with `std::move()` vs. not using `std::move()`.
