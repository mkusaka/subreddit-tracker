Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I have a fair amount of experience developing cross-platform C++ console applications (mostly for scientific computing). I mostly use GCC/G++, and my IDE of choice in the last couple of years has been Visual Studio Code. However, I have no experience developing GUI apps.

I would like to develop a C++ GUI app with the following properties:

1. Can compile binaries for all the popular platforms: **Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and web browser (with WebAssembly)**, all with the same code, or at least the same base code with some additional front-end code on top (e.g. the desktop, mobile, and web GUIs will probably have different layouts). 

2. Can compile for all platforms using the **same compiler**, if possible (mostly to ensure that I don't have to rewrite the code for different platforms due to compiler incompatibilities).

3. The compiler must fully support **C++17**.

4. One IDE can be used to develop the code for all platforms, including a **WYSIWYG editor for the GUI**. (I'd love to keep using VS Code, but as far as I can tell it has no WYSIWYG editor... Unless there's some extension I'm not aware of that can do that..?)

5. The development will be take place on Windows, so it's fine if the IDE itself is Windows-only (e.g. Visual Studio).

6. The GUI should have a **native look** on every platform.

Is this a pipe dream? If not, then which **compiler, IDE, and GUI library** will provide this functionality?

Thanks!

 Hey everyone,

Wanted to share a productivity tool called [Zenreader](https://www.zenreader.co.uk/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=aw20promo) for students, academics and professionals that I've worked on building over the past few years with C++ - it's in the beta stage.

Zenreader is used for rapidly building a body of knowledge/evidence and drafting papers. It used to take notes, organise these and produce excellent reports quickly.

Looking for feedback to see how we can improve this further! New to reddit - let me know if this should not be posted here.
## [11][What naming conventions for constants ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jj2f1z/what_naming_conventions_for_constants/)

It's pretty easy to choose a style for functions, types, variables (snake case everywhere except types in pascal case, for me).  But how do you differentiate constants ?

C++ core guidelines says "all caps only for macros" and seems to advocate for snake case for enums.  It makes sense for scoped enums, start to look weird for old-style enum, and gets worse with a simple constexpr int...

    constexpr int block_size = 4096;
    
    int SuperParser::read(int size) {
        ...
        int size_in_blocks = size / block_size;
        ...
    }

Do you have anything better than the Google convention of kCamelCase ?
