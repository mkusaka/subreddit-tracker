Was going through Tanner [Linsley's talk on react query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seU46c6Jz7E&amp;feature=youtu.be).  I have one doubt at 12:07. why we are using ref to keep track if the current promise is resolved or not ? why can't we simply use a variable.

code - 

\`\`\`

const activePromiseRef = React.useRef(false);

const refresh = () =&gt; {

if (!activePromiseRef.current){

activePromiseRef.current = async () =&gt; {

// fetch data here and   after that

setData(data) // updates the state

activePromiseRef.current = false;

}

}

}

\`\`\`

main reason for this code is that, if two requests occur simultaneously, then instead of firing another request we return the previous promise.

**My questions is why do we need a ref in this case, why not a simple variable.**
## [7][useContext in Action.js (outside of React Component)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hjweay/usecontext_in_actionjs_outside_of_react_component/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hjweay/usecontext_in_actionjs_outside_of_react_component/

Currently I have some state stored in DataContext.js, however, I'd like to access this data from in an Action.js file.

The DataContext is normally pulled with the useContext hook and this is possible since a component is wrapped in DataContextProvider.

However, my Action.js is not a React component (and thus not wrapped in the DataContextProvider). Is there any way I can access the state?

## [10][Best ways to handle rendering one component vs. another when dealing with media queries and SSR?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hjvnji/best_ways_to_handle_rendering_one_component_vs/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hjvnji/best_ways_to_handle_rendering_one_component_vs/
---
Hey /r/react, I have an app that I am developing using next.js which uses server side rendering. I have a table in which I want to show information about `item`s (to keep things generic). I would like to display cards when the user is viewing the table on mobile, and a proper table when viewed on desktop.

Since next.js server side renders, I cannot use solutions like [react-media-match](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-media-match) since the `window` object is not available on the server. Since that is the case, I have opted to rendering both views and wrapping them with divs that will be hidden by media queries using `display: none;`.

My question is: is this the best approach? I am wary that since both tables will be rendered this will impact performance and potentially SEO (since there's duplicated meaningless content on the page). Ideally I would have a way to conditionally render either component based on whether the user is viewing on mobile or desktop.

Here's my code:

    interface IItemTableProps {}

    const ItemTable: React.FC&lt;IItemTableProps&gt; = () =&gt; {
      const { items, loading } = useFetchedItems()

      if (loading) {
        return &lt;div&gt;loading...&lt;/div&gt;
      }

      return (
        &lt;Container&gt;
          &lt;div className="mobile-cards-container"&gt;
            &lt;MobileCards items={items} /&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div className="desktop-table-container"&gt;
            &lt;DesktopTable items={items} /&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/Container&gt;
      )
    }

    const Container = styled.div`
      .mobile-cards-container {
        display: block;
      }

      .desktop-table-container {
        display: none;
      }

      ${media.desktop} {
        .mobile-cards-container {
          display: none;
        }

        .desktop-table-container {
          display: block;
        }
      }

## [12][Suggestions for a MERN-based app](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hjtvnp/suggestions_for_a_mernbased_app/)

Hello, 

I'm in my third year of undergrad program and I just started writing my thesis on the topic of MERN stack. I will lay out theoretical foundation of the technologies used in the stack and then I will focus on implementing a practical app in the MERN stack. However, I still haven't decided on what the app would be about. So far things that I have come up with are: 

* A marketplace for a local business to sell various stuff (IT, groceries or sth else)
* Simplified social media platform clone (Instagram, Twitter), I've seen projects like these pop up here and there on this subreddit

One of the things I want to make sure to include in my app is the ability to chat in real-time with other users, for what I plan to use WebSockets. Though I'd want to make sure to not stray too far off the main topic (MERN technologies).

What are your suggestions for an application implemented using MERN stack? Is there something that hasn't yet been seen, but you would like see it implemented?

Thanks in advance!

NB. My experience level with JS and programming in general is intermediate I would say - I already created a relatively simple full stack app using bootstrap on the front end and PHP &amp; MySQL on the backend
