This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hey guys. My friend and I have been thinking about developing an app. He's much more into Hybrid technologies like Ionic or Cordova and I think native app would be better as it is only for Android. I decided to research it a bit.

**React Native:** Amazing GUI with Native look, performance similar to Native apps,  biggest market and community.

**FLutter:** Best user interface, still new and market/community not as big as others, performance is outstanding.

**Ionic:** UI using HTML and CSS, second most popular community after React native, loses in performance when compared to others.

**Kotlin:** Native UI, market is growing fast, performs better than Java with better security, syntax and compatibility.

What do you guys suggest?

Edit: The major focus is on UI and it will have network calls but might eventually grow bigger with time as lot of features might be added.

The last Android app I developed was about 3 or 4 years ago: I used Java, Butterknife, Retrofit, and Objectbox for persistence.
Now I'm trying to get up to date to develop a new app using Kotlin, but trying to find out what I should use is a nightmare:

- Butterknife is deprecated, but with Kotlin I can use something called synthetics. But wait, that is no longer recommended. Maybe I should use this DataBinding thing. But there is an even newer thing called ViewBinding!

- I heard that with Kotlin I can use Anko to make things easier. But that is deprecated, now I can use Kotlin Extensions. But the official link about Kotlin Extensions redirects to a different web that talks about something called KTX. Is that the same thing?

- AsyncTask task is no longer recommended. What should I use instead? Coroutines?

- Coroutines are supposed to make working with callbacks (in Retrofit, for example) easier, but boy, after watching youtube tutorials I think I'll stick with callbacks.

Anyway, my main complaint is that there are dozens of ways and tools to do the same thing, every couple of months there is a newer one, and every tutorial/course/book I check uses different methodologies (even official Google tutorials), so I don't know what I should use.
Can you recommend me sources that are up to date so that I can learn what are the current de facto practices, tools, libraries, etc?

https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/releases/tag/1.3.6

StateFlow is here, the new "BehaviorSubject" (in RxJava world) for Coroutines, I can't wait to get rid of all the `ConflatedBroadcastChannel`s in my codebase ðŸ˜€

So it's been a week now since Google suspended my app because a news article pulled from an RSS feed contained the word Covid19. I appealed on day 1 and removed any mention of Covid.

I get why they are doing it but surely there has to be a better way. I'm losing customers and potential customers because of this. Trying to find anyone to contact is impossible from what I can see, I thought I might get somewhere by messaging @googleplaydev on twitter but no luck.

It has been a stressful week so far, I've hardly slept through trying to get it resolved but it looks like it will be a case of hoping it will be resolved. 

Do Google work on appeals on weekends? 

I really feel for anyone else going through the same thing.

Especially written in Java because that's where I'm personally trying to improve as a junior dev, but Kotlin would be great too.
