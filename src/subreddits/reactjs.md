We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

1) state changes inside the component

2) props changes inside the component (when the state changes in the parent)

3) render being called on the component's parent

&amp;#x200B;

All three can cause unnecessary rerenders, what are the fixes for all three cases?

Anybody has experience with alternatives like [https://fusionjs.com/](https://fusionjs.com/) or [http://www.electrode.io/](http://www.electrode.io/)?

They look very good from the first view but I wonder if somebody is using them.

I've created a website in React.js, and for my own reasons, I need this website to be available as an android app. I expect this to be done using a very simple approach - simply a frame or webview component inside a native app which runs my website full screen.

I understand the many downsides that come with such a simple approach, and that my app would be better served developing again natively for android, but I'm not looking for a long term robust solution. I just need my current website as an app!

Is there a free service that can do this for me? Or is there a simple way to do this quickly in React Native or something similar?

Thank you!

Hey, below is my array and I want to slice the every instance of createdAt value. I tried but couldn't seem to do this. Any help will be useful.

Sorry if this isn't the correct sub.

    const array = [
        {
            "deleted": false,
            "_id": "5e53bbeb68667320462295d8",
            "price": 300,
            "points": 0,
            "_userId": "5e5291a405e4b513f6e670b5",
            "createdAt": "2020-02-24T12:04:59.309Z",
            "updatedAt": "2020-02-24T12:04:59.309Z",
            "__v": 0
        },
        {
            "deleted": false,
            "_id": "5e53bbf368667320462295d9",
            "price": 300,
