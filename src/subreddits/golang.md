If you go into almost any post (on Reddit, HN, Lobste.rs) about fasthttp itself or a project that uses it, you'll most likely find at least one person talking about how it doesn't implement HTTP or has edge cases, etc.

My question is: what exactly are these edge cases and missing HTTP features.

I've been a Go dev since ~2010 so I've been here a looong time and I've never been able to find out what these edge cases and spec violations are, so I'm really curious to know.

*I ready somewhere that it doesn't support http2, but I don't feel like that counts.*

hi, so currently I've found the [gonum](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat) package which supports matrix operations but from my understanding it only supports 2d matrices.

does anyone know a package which provides the ability to manipulate 3d matrices?

thanks

So I imported a package which holds a generated protobuf interface. I've updated the protobuf definition, re-generated the interface and pushed it to GitHub.

Now I want do download the "new version" of the package so that my import stays valid. What's the common way to solve that problem? `go mod download` didn't work unfortunately.

I apologize if there's a FAQ somewhere that I missed, but can anyone point me to a good resource to learn Go? Free is obviously preferable, but if there's a course for a few bucks that is significantly more edifying, I can deal with that too.

For biographical reference, I'm pretty well versed in Java, and have some background in JS and Python.

Hi, I am new to go unit testing. I want to know about ho can I write unit tests for testing slack API. IMO, we do not have any return value as to use that API successfully, we need an access token and since the tests are written for some dummy values, they are never going to be passed.
