**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* 🚨 **Updated Remote section.** 🚨 You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [🚨 **Updated!** 🚨 Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft?

Howdy.  Coming to C++ from the Javascript/Typescript world, with a little dabbling in Java, C, and Rust (though JS/TS is my main language). 

The instructor on the Udemy course I'm taking recommends creating seperate .h and .cpp files for classes. The header contains the class definitions and declarations, while the .cpp file contains the methods. 

But I'm a little worried about this when C++ classes aren't like Java classes, in that the values can be referenced *by name* outside of the expected scope. 

What I'm concerned about is that balance is... just kinda sitting there.  It's 
So for example: 


```c++
/* Account.h */
#ifndef _ACCOUNT_H_
#define _ACCOUNT_H_
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Account {
 private:
  double balance{0.0}; // &lt;-- balance is declared here. 

 public:
  // methods
  void set_balance(double bal);
  double get_balance();
};

#endif
```

but in a seperate file:

```c++
/* Account.cpp */
#include "Account.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// methods
void Account::set_balance(double bal) {
  balance = bal; // &lt;-- this line here is worrying me
};
double Account::get_balance() {
  return balance; // &lt;-- same here.
};
```

Wouldn't it make it much easier to read if have everything in the Account.h file? That is - if you're a programmer looking at Account.cpp, and you see "balance" in the set_balance method, then the first thing you're going to think of is: "If that's not defined in this scope, what scope is it defined in?  The *scope* exists in a *completely different file.*

I've rarely seen this happen in the JS world; where we do use class definitions, we tend to keep them all in the same place - properties, methods, &amp; constructors all in the same file. But *even if* we split defining class definitions and method definitions into different files, we have a variable name defined in our import statement. And when we're working with the properties of the values, such as balance, we use 'this' to note that balance is a property of the class.  


```javascript
import Account from './Account'; 

Account.prototype.setBalance = function(balanceValue){
  this.balance = balanceValue;
}
```

Am I wrong or does this seem like a really weird convention?

Hi All,

I have compiled a **guideline diagram** and article on how to pass shared\_ptr and unique\_ptr in function arguments and what to pass at the time of return.

After reading Herb's blog, C++ guidelines, and a few other references I have put together this and few guideline matrices which are in this article.

This article covers the following -

1. Always ask yourself “Do I really need to pass a smart pointer”
2. std::unique\_ptr usage
3. std::shared\_ptr usage
4. How to pass correctly pass raw pointer/reference.
5. For Returning smart pointers, what is the norm?

I searched but never found a good graphical representation of these guidelines, hence I thought I'd give that a try :)  Please help me in improving anything which is incorrect or missing in this.
## [11][CI service for iOS testing without XCTest](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hbjgmi/ci_service_for_ios_testing_without_xctest/)

The company I work for sells a library (not an app) that runs on iOS, among other platforms. 

Currently we've got an on-prem build farm with several mac minis with iPhones attached to them. As the company grows, this isn't really working for us anymore. For those that don't know, the iPhone needs to remain unlocked for you to do anything to it. If the iPhone locks up for whatever reason, somebody has to physically access the device to open it back up. Because of this annoyance we're looking to move to some cloud based product to help us with iOS testing.

There's no shortage of CI products out there offering iOS testing, but I notice that a lot of them have 1 major limitation, they require your tests to be XCTest based. A lot of the services that are top results on Google (ie Bitrise) seem to have this limitation.

Currently our tests are not XCTest based, and instead use Catch2. To run the tests, we wrap each Catch test executable in an app, and run that on device using "ios-deploy". Ideally, we'd love to find a service where we can have a similar workflow.

I'd love to hear the community's recommendation on how you handle your C++ projects that run on iOS, and any other tips on making iOS development less painful.

Thanks!
