This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

In this article, i mentioned how you can use a gradle plugin to generate class for you. You can use this idea, if you want to make something similar.

Don't know if this is the place but anyone played with [in-app updates](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates). For testing they say on step 3  **On the test device, only click the internal app-sharing link for the updated version of your app and do not install.**  Why is this step necessary and should I suppose when I upload it to prod that users will click on the app page and not click update to be shown this dialog?

Do you guys love to get a Weekly newsletter that curates great developer articles, tutorials, Blogs, and events? 

For example, here is [an issue of my weekly newsletter](https://mobiledeveloperscafe.substack.com/p/mdc-weekly-blend-edition-10) which curates articles from great developers around the world. 

Do you think this curation would be helpful for you guys? 

Apart from the curated articles, blogs, Dev tools, events, and open source libraries, do you think any other information should be helpful?

I'm a student and curious about Android. But I would like to learn some not so popular topics too which are good to know when you are an android dev.

## [12][Create a google play account for the company instead of individual](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jdctrb/create_a_google_play_account_for_the_company/)

Hello,

I'm having some difficulties trying to register a google play account for my company. I've started by creating a new google account by selecting "To manage my business" and after that I've selected payment method and added a new card. This has automatically created a payment profile with the account type as individual with no option to change it to business. 

I looked over different help sections and from what I saw, I should have seen an option to chose from individual/business when creating the payment profile. I deleted the payment profile and create it again several times and couldn't see any option.

Did someone else had the same problem and could provide some exact steps on how can I create a payment profile with the account type as business?
