Hi, I have a project due so this is time sensitive, I'm a coding student.

Nokogiri scraping data:

If I want to select to scrape by css, but for like, just a filtered list that appears with a url fragment tag, how do I format that?

example:[https://www.domain.com/phones/mobile#smartphone](https://www.domain.com/phones/mobile#smartphone)

how would i format that for nokogiri using doc.css?  I see the filtered list is under its own div and has a "class=selected" but the info I need that is display is in a different div.  Any help appreciated, I'm really exhausted and stayed up until 5am last night despite having work today, and I really am stuck.  I don't want to fail out of my class.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to get around the following error 

\`NoMethodError: undefined method \`\[\]' for nil:NilClass\` - it's failing because of the pagination of the filtered lists, so I just wanted to select one of the url fragment filters and then my program will work like it should and I can go to bed.

A mersenne prime is a prime number where the prime number plus one is a power of two.
The code is working, but I suspect my power_of_two? helper method is preventing the code from running at a realistic speed. I've been trying to figure out a different way to approach that method. If I think of it as a folder that always divides by 2 I was thinking maybe it would work better recursively, but making a boolean recursive helper function is way over my head at the moment.
