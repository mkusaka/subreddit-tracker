Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!

It's been at least two years since I dabbled in server side react.

I'm hoping maybe folks could fill me in if there have been any major changes in implementations.

For context, I'm starting an ecommerce website that will hit a graphql/node.js api. I was going to just do create-react-app but then it hit me I probably need ssr to get the SEO impact I want?

If you were to put together an SSR ecommerce react app-- how would you approach it? Next? Gatsby? From scratch?

Note I'm very comfortable with react/node, so I'd be find building it from scratch. That said, I don't mind giving up some control if it makes life easier-- so I'm open to leveraging tools too (next, gatsby, etc).

Sorry if this is a little vague but I'd like to leave it more open ended in hopes of getting a variety of different feeedback on SSR in general.

[https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/hello-world/en/react.htm](https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/hello-world/en/react.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why?**

It's a fast way to include React on any web page and build apps with using a build process or large dependencies. Simply use React with JSX in a page or site and include needed CDN or JavaScript links.

&amp;#x200B;

**How ?**

It compiles JSX directly to JS for modern browsers and downloads Polyfills and Babel Standalone for IE and other old browsers. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Doesnâ€™t Babel Standalone do this already?** 

Yes, however when Babel Standalone is used in a Browser it is intended for prototyping. This script is intended for production use. Originally I used Babel Standalone for all React demos on the site however it takes a lot of memory and causes a delay of many seconds when viewing pages from a mobile device. Once I created this script memory was reduced up to 5x and content renders almost instantly now.

Hi All,

I'm hoping someone out there may be able to help me with a plain English understanding of how to access state when using React (with Redux).

Despite doing 4+ courses and reading numerous tutorials I am struggling to understand "how to access state" in my applications.

My understanding (which may not be 100% correct?) is that Redux acts as a global store for state in my application.

Where I then get fuzzy is that if a user signs up for my application are these details stored in the state and readily accessible from other components/pages I create?

For example, I did Brad Traverseys course on React/Redux (my code from the project is here [https://github.com/pvptowers/DevConnector-MERN](https://github.com/pvptowers/DevConnector-MERN)) 

So if I then wanted to create another component that say for example displayed the users email address can I just access the state? Or do I need another API call to the backend to get this info again? If its the later then what role is state playing here?

Sorry if these questions are dumb. I've been learning to code for 4 months (2 months on React) and since completing my courses have literally spent 2 weeks playing around with React and Redux trying to figure this out on my own and I'm just stumped.

Perhaps you also know another resource or tutorial that might make it click for me?

Thanks in advance

Paul

## [12][Serving gzipped file with NextJs 9.0.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f9qfyh/serving_gzipped_file_with_nextjs_901/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f9qfyh/serving_gzipped_file_with_nextjs_901/

Im working on enabling gzip on a project that i'm involved with now, which uses NextJs version 9.0.1. This version doesn't have compression enabled on it, so i'm setting the compression on my own using compression-webpack-plugin on NextJs. 

`const withSass = require("@zeit/next-sass");`

`const withCss = require("@zeit/next-css");`

`const CompressionPlugin = require('compression-webpack-plugin');`

&amp;#x200B;

`module.exports = withCss(withSass({`

  `webpack(config, options) {`

`// Enable gzip compression using webpack compression plugin`

`config.plugins.push(`

`new CompressionPlugin({`

`algorithm: "gzip",`

`test: /\.js$|\.css$|\.html$/,`

`threshold: 10240,`

`minRatio: 0.8`

`})`

`);`

`return config;`

  `}`

`}));`

&amp;#x200B;

The compression works fine, and it produces the gzip file when i build the project using npm run build. But problem is when i try to run it, it still serve the uncompressed files (the normal js, css..).

I see ppl said about using Express.js to enable serving the gzip files, but say if i don't want to use Express, is it possible to change the next.config.js to serve gzipped files instead? Anywhere within the next.config.js that i need to change or add to make this happen?
