* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hello, I'm still a baby in diapers in Android Dev and finishing my Multiplatform App Development degree here in Spain.

What I've been teached in school sucks and some of the content is now deprecated. For example we've been teached Android Dev only in Java, MVC pattern instead of MVVM, implementation of a RecyclerView has been teached like shit and I couldn't stop having a cloudy smile because of it (Thanks god I've been doing some side courses) and a long etc...

I've developed simple apps to learn in my own and for my classes exercises with libraries such as Volley(eww never again), Retrofit, Firebase, Room and I dunno if other more? Glide, Picasso meeh

I understand basics things of Kotlin, but then I get confused in somethings advanced like for example, a class with static methods for multiple uses in Java is replaced with companion / object class in Kotlin, but when I try to implement it I get errors because I'm not doing it correctly, so that means I need more practice and understand the concepts of the language better.

Because of that, I'm trying to find a course that's not for beginners but neither for super advanced dudes.

I've found this [https://www.udemy.com/course/modernandroid/](https://www.udemy.com/course/modernandroid/) but I have no idea about the instructor, what I saw is that he has many courses using modern android development as Kotlin, Coroutine, JetPack, MVVM, Livedata. So... I'm gonna give it a try, but I would love to hear your opinion and if you have any good resources for my purposes. I really want to learn and develop android apps "correctly" with the last tech.

I'll like to use Toasts only on the development phase, and I assume that it is possible with Gradle. Unfortunately Idk how to do it, and the Gradle tutorials that I've found are not talking about this problem.

Can you share your approach about the development vs production flavors of code?

I'm fairly new with android development and even though it can be overwhelming sometimes I still love it.

But I was wondering which things I should be using or maybe you could give me some insight which you are using and which not?

There are for example things like Dagger 2 which seems to be a must-have for every little bigger app. Same for MVVM I would say.

But what about all the architecture components? For me they all seem great and I think I should use/learn them all.

I often read here that many don't like Navigation or Data Binding for example but to me they look great.

And what about UI libraries? Material Design is one where most people agree that it's pretty good. But not long ago I was using Firebase UI in particular FirebaseRecyclerAdapter and when looking for help many would just say why I am using it if I can do it without Firebase UI?

To me it seems like a nice, Google supported library which will save me a ton of work, but it seems like more advanced developers think otherwise.

Would love some insight and advice to help me and I'm sure many other newcomers.

Basically, how can I make it so that a notification or method executes if a Boolean has been true for lets say 13 seconds?

I appreciate the help.

Hello, recently I have started learning android apps development, however I've faced a problem, that makes it not as fun as it could be. The problem is that android studio with emulator is taking 100% of my budget laptop's ram and everything is running so slow, so I thought maybe I could run apps on my phone. Are there any big differences? I know with emulator e.g I can kill processes. I tried to find some informations about, but I couldn't or it very old. Thank you all for help.

The app is called WorkoutFH. If you're stuck in quarantine and have some free time on your hands, I'm looking for an android developer with at least 2 years of experience.

* I'm Ed. Back before I worked for a big company I used to build my own apps (Writeaday was my most popular).
* I'm currently coding but, I also dabble in Sketch so I'll be directly working on the design mocks.
* The idea is for us to both be working in parallel every day and get this app to a launchable state by next weekend.

**Motivation**

* While stuck at home in California under quarantine, I really found myself wanting a way to track work-from-home workouts I've been doing.
* I thought it would be cool to build an app that helps people take breaks from working and acts as a tracker for number of pushups, pullups, etc.

**Logistics**

* Pay: $50/hr or we can do it project-based. We'll work it out.
* Let's start with 1 hour to set up the codebase and take a look at the way that I code my xml files and write java code. Then maybe 2 hours to add a color picker row to the "new habit dialog".
* Here's the project which you'll be submitting pull requests to: [https://github.com/eddieberklee/workoutfh](https://github.com/eddieberklee/workoutfh)
