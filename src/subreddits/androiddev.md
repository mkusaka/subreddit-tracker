* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi,

I used my old Lenovo Moto Z Play for App development (Android 9 via Lineage OS). It worked fine, no performance issues whatsoever. After I updated to Android Studio 4.0 the performance of Android Studio is \~5fps when the Lenovo is connected (wire and wifi). If I disconnect it, the performace is back to normal. This however doesnt happen when I connect my Pixel 4XL.

Does anyone have a similar issue / knows how to fix it?

Thanks in advance :)
