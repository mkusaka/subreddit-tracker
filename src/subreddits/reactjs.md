Hey everyone!

Over the past year this sub has more than doubled in subscribers, from **~75k** to **150k+**. This is incredible growth and we're happy so many people want to discuss, share, and learn react. We are continuously trying to improve this sub so that it stays a first-class source of react information.

With that said, we'd like to learn more about you all! We put together a survey that will take under 5 minutes to complete. It consists of demographic surveying, tech stack questions, and general feedback on how we're doing moderating this community.

We value your feedback greatly and look forward to a follow-up post showing the results, likely in the new year. 

**Happy Holidays and New Year!**

Hi all I'm new here but I wanted to share with you my first proper react app -&gt; [**https://foiz.io/**](https://foiz.io/?q=bg)

If is free to use, vacation days (days off work) tracker that allows you to share your calendar with other people and see the public holidays for a specific country (for now it only works for Bulgaria and Netherlands but more are coming).

It would be great if you can check it, play with it, leave some feedback and if you like it share it with a fried :)

[https://spy-insta.com](https://spy-insta.com)

It's a website that allows users to spy on Instagram stories and highlights anonymously. (Originally, only logged-in users can see the stories which will leave their user names on the story owner's seen by list)

It's created with Reactjs for the front-ed and Nodejs for the server side.

Since Instagram doesn't provide an official API that provides Instagram stories, I used unofficial Instagram API instead.

Take a look those who are interested!
## [6][ðŸ”¥A collection of beautiful and (hopefully) useful React hooks to speed-up your components and hooks development](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eiz7ru/a_collection_of_beautiful_and_hopefully_useful/)

Hello everyone,

few days ago I've published a React hooks library on github &amp; npm hoping it will be useful to others as it is for me.I've based few other components on this library so far and I'm willing to share it in the best possible open source spirit.

Recently I've updated the documentation (to clarify the reason why I've created this one and I'm not using other hook libraries) and added few more hooks.

Please feel free to comment, fork, share, star, whatever :)

## [7][Mentor React Developers into Contributing to Open Source? #UpSkillie](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ejfktu/mentor_react_developers_into_contributing_to_open/)

Hi all, We at UpSkillie.com train developers into becoming better developers for remote work. You can read more about us at

As a part of our course, we run a program to encourage developers to contribute to open-source projects. So we are essentially looking for some good first-timer projects or maintainers for new projects where our students can contribute to.

Searching for first-times-issues wasn't of much help as all the open issues are either taken or insignificant in adding any value.

So if you are looking for spare hands to contribute to your open source project and that could be a good learning experience. Preferably the students should be able to deliver something in less than a week.

You can read more about us at https://medium.com/upskillie/what-we-do-at-upskillie-bac826d6550a

Hello everyone. I have just returned to React after few months that I spent working around with Vue and I created this little app as warm up before facing some more complex topics.

Its is simple clone of MacOS's Note app. Of course comparing to native app some features are missed there.

I created this extension because i love makinig notes, especially when i study online there are many content rich websites, it helps me to learn when i jot down some key points with my understanding. Initially, i found an extension called Note Anywhere, but it's a bit difficult to format text nicely, then i thought i could create a similar one using react and markdown! If you are interested, please try it out!

It's draggable, resizeble, autosave on typing and with an options page to manage notes!

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, there are a few problems with it, the popover has conflicts with websites that use material-ui Paper, i am planning to move them to options page or reimplement them without material-ui.
