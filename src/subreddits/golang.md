Hi there. So I've been learning Go for about a month now (primarily for web development) and I think I'm really familiar already with the syntax, features and constructs of Go, as well as with the available libraries for common tasks (gorilla packages, orms, etc) that I have at my disposal.

However, I feel I haven't seen much about modularizing a web application (or any other kind of application for that matter) in Go. Some books and tutorials I've read (or watched) are mainly writing code into the main package, and most of them put everything in a single file. Since I want to use Go for a big project I have in mind, I don't think that way of doing things will scale. 

So my question is, do you know big codebases that conform a web application in a modular approach that I can read and take some ideas from? I'm thinking about big open-source web apps developed in Go.

And if you have some ideas or experience or suggestion on how to modularize go code, that would be great. For instance, I know how to use go modules and how to define code for different packages. But I have trouble understanding how those are discovered by the compiler and what are the conventions to organize your code in them. 

I know is a general topic, but I'm also looking for a general answer.

I'm using Redis for queuing and mongo for persistence Using REST, 

I could add queue and workers run queue without any issues 

[https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/workers/queue.go#L53](https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/workers/queue.go#L53)

I could easily quit existing workers on a queue 

[https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/rest/queue.go#L79](https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/rest/queue.go#L79)

[https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/workers/queue.go#L139](https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/workers/queue.go#L139)

but am unable to add workers on queue while app is running 

[https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/workers/worker.go#L158](https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/blob/master/workers/worker.go#L158)

My testing repo 

[https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/tree/master/workers](https://github.com/itsursujit/queue/tree/master/workers)

Please let me know what mistake I've done and possibility to fix it.

Thanks

Toy simulation project for visualisation of atmospheric air pollution dispersion - no real practical use, but was curious to see what the performance of in-browser number-crunching was like.

LIVE EXAMPLE here: [https://joshuanunn.github.io/really-simple-dispersion/example](https://joshuanunn.github.io/really-simple-dispersion/example) and detailed description in the README.

Any comments welcome!
