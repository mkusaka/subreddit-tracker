Is there an easy way to convert pojos in data classes? Using the convert function in Android studio, my pojos only get converted to normal classes and I have to convert manually to data classes which would take way too much time with 100+ pojos..

Thanks!

Thought I'd share my library, **spotify-web-api-kotlin**, with you all. It's a Kotlin MPP wrapper around Spotify's web api that allows for idiomatic Kotlin and targets Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS, and Android, with plans to include native targets in the near future. It's been around since 2018, evolving from a series of utilities I was using for my own Discord bots after being disheartened with existing Java wrappers.

spotify-web-api-kotlin supports all Spotify authorization flows, including PKCE.

Please let me know what you think!
