Hello fellow Gophers,

I wanted to share a project I have been working on (I've shared it previously, but have made some updates since). It's called `stars` \- it's a CLI for working with your starred projects (Stars) on GitHub.

It can:

* Save all of your stars to your local filesystem
* Display projects according to any combination of: count, language, labels, random
* Unstar projects that have not been pushed to in more than *n* months (also archived ones)
* (New) automatically star repos (that are recently pushed to in *n* months, not archived) from a URL - by extracting GitHub repo URLs
* (New) automatically star repos (that are recently pushed to in *n* months, not archived) from a given GitHub org

I find value it in because it helps me keep better track of all of my starred projects, and allows me to view random ones flash card style. That really helps when I have a problem to solve, because I can know whether something is already out there that meets my needs before attempting to write it myself.

It also allows me to stay up to date on popular / new / trending (etc.) projects on GitHub.

I'd love to hear your feedback on it.

I am part way finished writing a [QR code generator](https://github.com/grkuntzmd/qrcodegen) based on  [https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator). It supports most (all?) of the ISO/IEC 18004:2006 and is licensed under Apache-2.

I still need to add test cases, ported from the C version in Nayuki, and I plan to add the optimized segments from the Java version.

It has a convenience function to produce SVG.

Hello, I'm learning Go by creating (or trying to create) a REST api for an iOS application.

Never worked with it or creating REST api before, so I don't really know if what I'm doing is correct, if it is in the best "practice area" etc. I try to read Go code on Github, and of course went over the Go Tour, by still feeling like maybe I'm not writing good code.

The code does work, and does gets the job done correctly, but I always wonder if there is better ways to do / write certain things.

While I know a code can't be perfect and there are a lot of ways to get the job done in programming, I still wonder how can I know if I'm writing ok code?
