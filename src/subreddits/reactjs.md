We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I want to generate maps but I have found d3.js to be quite difficult for something basic, in my case, a map showing europe with a popup when you press a country giving some information about it. I have used React-leaflet but I don't like the tiles, I want something abit more basic in a way, that doesn't show all the roads and stuff

Hi everyone!

Iâ€™m trying to include my tsParticles project to the react-particles-js but itâ€™s not loading correctly. Some configurations works and others donâ€™t. I donâ€™t understand what itâ€™s not working.

Can somebody help me?

The projects used are:

https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles
https://github.com/matteobruni/react-particles-js
https://github.com/matteobruni/react-particles-js-demo

Iâ€™m currently npm linking the last two project and using the npm version of the first one.
I have never used React before and probably I am missing something.
