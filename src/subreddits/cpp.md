**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

Been working on my programming language - Feral, implemented in C++14.

The repositories: [https://github.com/Feral-Lang](https://github.com/Feral-Lang) (Compiler/VM is in the **Feral** repository)

WIP Book: [https://feral-lang.github.io/Book/](https://feral-lang.github.io/Book/)

Article: [https://medium.com/@ElectruxR/the-feral-programming-language-81f87deb58cc?sk=e2cfe98332fc4684e1e792b88aebe2ba](https://medium.com/@ElectruxR/the-feral-programming-language-81f87deb58cc?sk=e2cfe98332fc4684e1e792b88aebe2ba)

The VM, as of now, is by no means very fast. It is still a work in progress.

Feedback and suggestions of any kind are most certainly welcome and appreciated.

Thanks a lot &lt;3 &lt;3

I have a problem. I am doing programming on c++ for several years but my knowledge is pretty inconsistent. I know that I should read the cpp iso standard, cppcoreguidelines, cpp best practices by Meyers and so on. But is there any comprehensive course for cpp programmers? That would deepen their knowledge, show best practices and reinforce them using appropriate tasks.
## [7][What's your experience in writing code for ARM compared to x86?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fvqf5j/whats_your_experience_in_writing_code_for_arm/)

There are tens of talks on how to optimize code for C++ and how you have to know the hardware you're writing the code for. But almost all talks consider that the code is targeting x86, however ARM architecture is also very popular but I cannot find that many talks or blogs about writing code for ARM. I would like to know more about any gotchas and experiences you have when writing code or porting code for ARM devices, specially if it's related to optimization.

As the title, says, I'm looking to improve the programs I do at graduate school by looking at existing, established, well-done and documented projects in my area of interest.

In my opinion, if I get told to do something I'll probably be able to, but not necessarily in the most elegant way. Be that functional/object-oriented programming, multi-file projects with multiple-folder levels, my goal is to make sure everything is organized, to allow for easy modifications or improvements on existing code, without being an spaguetti where you can't find anything or changing something somewhere breaks something else.

Therefore, any repos with good SWD practices using C++ are more than welcome. Thanks in advance.

Hello, I recently started to learn more about memory in C++. I know dynamic memory allocation and deallocation and custom allocators. Is there something else I can learn about memory in C++?
## [10][Reflection TS. Where/when to try? What do you think about it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fvccfa/reflection_ts_wherewhen_to_try_what_do_you_think/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fvccfa/reflection_ts_wherewhen_to_try_what_do_you_think/

I am very excited about static reflection proposal. I think with this proposal shoud be possible implement Dependency Injection, automatic function mapper (like in Asp.Net MVC, where you can just declare function `foo` in class, and http request with path `/foo` run this func), type mapper (there is Automapper and awesome thing like MassTransit for RabbitMQ in C#), etc.

I know that Clang already has implementation of Reflection, but not sure â€” is there up to date version of proposal?

Also, there was a proposal about custom attributes. I've used PostSharp in my job, so I am very excited to see implementation in C++ of automatic logger, maybe exception handling, caching (with Redis/KeyDB for example), etc. Is that propasal somehow implemented in clang?

What do you think? What problems can solve or what boilerplate code can remove this features in your projects? If you used any other languages, what features you wish to be implemented in C++?
