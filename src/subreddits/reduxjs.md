Welcome to PART 2 of building a simple shopping cart that takes advantage of React DnD. If you haven’t gone through PART 1, you can find it here. Also, if you will like to start building from PART2, make sure to clone and download PART1’s code as PART 2 is a continuation.

I have a form that has 10 inputs. Is it advised to maintain this state in the component or just pass props and update through redux? What is best practice.

Hi!  
I'm implementing a website with React Redux Saga and react router. I have a few pages where I need to display some cooking recipes. The recipe details like steps, ingredients, nutritional info and other stuff comes from the back-end.  
I want to use JsonLd schemas for better SEO (yeah, I know React is not the best tool for SEO) and I'm using React Helmet to add the required meta tags to each recipe page.  
My question is: Is it bad practice to have a SEO component that connects to the redux store and when the back-end responds with the data update the JsonLd schema?  
Thanks!

## [9][Subscribing multiple reducers to a single action in Redux Toolkit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/hc2255/subscribing_multiple_reducers_to_a_single_action/)

It seems like the suggested pattern to use is createSlice where actions and reducers have a 1:1 relationship based on the name/variable provided. createAsyncThunk seems to follow the same pattern.

Is there a way to write reducers (let's say for a different slice) to handle an action defined by createSlice/createAsyncThunk? Or would you have to write actions/reducers using createAction and createReducer?
