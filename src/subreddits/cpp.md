**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

I'm looking for codebases written with old versions of C++ -- stuff meant to be compiled with Cfront, etc.  Preferably something that has been in production at some point.  I'm looking to research different "dialects" and history of the language by taking a look at codebases of different eras.

C&amp;C remastered collection is available and from the first glance, seems to be a decent pre-c++98 look at things, I'm currently digging through sourceforge to find some old stuff but finding codebases like this that I could actually access seems to be a chore.

Anyone know a project or something where I could dig really old examples from?  I can try to dig old books from the library as well if anyone can name those.

I've no coding experience besides a tiny bit of HTML. I want to make my own game using c++ (UE), im wondering how hard the learning curve is self-teaching it, and my chances of success doing this. Its worth noting I've spent the past week watching youtube tutorials, and to my surprise its nothing even close to the difficulty I thought it would be, which has given me some confidence. The type of game I'd like to make would be something like your typical 3d FPS

Im already 27 years old, is it too late for me?

Some other questions: how important is it to know higher level math when creating a c++ game? 

Do you know any people who self taught programming and are now making a living out of it?

Should i go for a 2d game for my first time, is it that much easier than 3d?

Would C# be easier?

Should i give up on this dream, is it too far out of my scope? Please give it to me bluntly as I don't want to waste time.

Thank you.

Does a simple, easy to use, cross platform c++ programming environment exist?  


I am working on material for teaching c++ to physics students at my university. This class is a general overview of advanced programming concepts using c++ as an "example", so I really hope to use as little time as possible on setting up the programming environments on peoples computers. I really don't want to scare the students before even introducing the c++ language. Additionally, I would far prefer it if the same toolchain is used on mac, linux and windows so students are able to  cooperate with one another.

For windows, it seems to be easy to install Visual Studio, and include the clang/llvm compiler during the install. Visual Studio also has the build-in MS Build, which all in all results in a simple startup experience. But unfortunately Visual Studio is windows only.

VS code, on the other hand, is a cross platform IDE, but does not include either the compiler (which would thus have to be seperately installed). Also, since it does not have a buildin build system, one would have to be installed. This is not necessarily a problem, but I am not able to find one which integrates nicely with VS code. I would prefer not to have to also teach cmake, since the curriculum is plenty packed already. 

Outside of Visual Studio, I have yet to find a IDE which includes both a compiler and build system though a simple GUI. 

Any suggestions or tips are very helpful! I am currently considering having the students run code on a central computer, either through a web interface or by ssh-ing with vs code into a central server with everything up and running, but i hope to introduce them to a setup which they could use themselves after the course.

        static_assert(sizeof(Ref.Buffer) == 42);
    
        // However, it's not constexpr enough for std::size:

Is there a difference between libstdc++ and libstdc++11 in the current releases of gcc (or at least gcc &gt;=8)?

I want to create libraries that support code using the C++17 standard.  

I can't find any concise answer on which lib to use or if it even matters.
