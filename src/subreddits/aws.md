I'm collecting the most memorable keynotes of AWS on this page: https://awsvideocatalog.com/general/legendary - are there more worth adding?

Hi,

Just created an account to benefit a 12-month free vps ( t2.micro ), but before using it I'm wondering if the egress traffic is also free of charge or not ? I can't seem to find the information

Thank you
## [5][AWS + Serverless Framework + OpenAPI 3.0/Swagger generation](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/j9mb7g/aws_serverless_framework_openapi_30swagger/)

Hi everybody,

I am using serverless framework with AWS and TS and have to add an (semi-autogenerated) Open API specification of it. I have been scouting the possibilities to do so but all of them seem pretty meh.

I found [serverless-aws-documentation](https://github.com/deliveryhero/serverless-aws-documentation) plugin which in theory does the trick + it would be great to define it insiede `serverless.yml` where our validation layer is already defined. However, it looks dead + does not seem to support multiple serverless.yml files (basically it loses context of the paths etc.).

Another possibility would be to adopt a framework like Nest, Koala or Express and but I'd rather not move our project to mono-lambda realm. The frameworks seem to support autogenerated swaggers/OpenAPIs but mostly for containerized types of work.

There is also Amazon API Gateway Export which I don't really know how would fit here. (Is that mechanism any good, even without the serverless?). Perhaps somebody could give me a hand.

We also could try finding/writing our own decorators and webpack build, so that CI/CD walks recursively through `.ts` files and automatically generates OpenAPI 3.0 spec from the annotations. This is handful of work though and my team has only few developers, already overwhelmed with amount of work. :P

Lastly, manual writing of `.yaml` files. Duh.

I'd love to hear your stories about similar issues. Have you ever generated a Swagger or OpenAPI 3.0 in serverless realm? If yes, how was it?

Will running the AWS SMS that snapshots and sends deltas to AWS every few hours interfere with Veeam backups (or vica-versa)  Or would the two products track their own snapshots and CBT in vSphere?

I own a windows machine. I’ve downloaded the PPK file to connect with my insurance on ssh. But whenever i try opening the paegant app in windows, it shows “The service is already running’’. How should I open the app ?
## [8][Best security practices for a WordPress website on AWS?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/j9qktx/best_security_practices_for_a_wordpress_website/)

So, I want to host my WordPress website on AWS EC2. Just wanted to know how can I make my Instance secure from exploits and hackers.

I know how a self-managed Dedicated Web Hosting server works, In dedicated server they provide with a empty machine and then I need to take care of it's maintenance, updates, security etc. 

But it looks like AWS doesn't work this way. In AWS I don't get a dedicated server/PC, instead I have to use their cloud applications to create instances, etc.

So, as someone who's using AWS (or any other Cloud Computing service) for the first time, what security measures can I take here? 
Other than keeping my account passwords secure.
## [9][connecting to aws postgres database](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/j9j7ua/connecting_to_aws_postgres_database/)

Noob question here. I've been having a hard time connecting to a postgres database instance in AWS.

    import psycopg2
    
    myConnection = psycopg2.connect( host=hostname, user=username, password=password, dbname=database)

Under  connection and security I copied the endpoint and  passed it to the `host` parameter, the default port for posgres is is 5432 and `psycopg2.connect`.

Under security i modified my public accesssability ot yes.

The parameter user is my `Master username` which is available under configuration and Availability. I copied my password.

for dbname, I've tried both  `DB instance id`  and `DB name`. Both available under configuration and  Configuration.

It's unable to connect. I tried both Pycharm database connection tool and `psycopg2`

What did i do wrong?
## [10][Is there ANY real reason one would not want to lower the TTL for caching with CloudFront? Noticed I have to wait 24 hours for changes to fully update on Cloudfront from S3 bucket...but don't see why I wouldn't want to set it to 1 hour instead.

So, basically the title. I have a static website I have on S3 and use cloudfront with it. Basically, with the URL, it goes through cloudfront, but the files are held in S3 bucket.

One thing I recently noticed is I changed the CSS for the static website and also added an image. The image change went through, but the CSS change did not. I verified that the CSS changes do work when I access the content directly from the S3 bucket, so I know this really is a caching issue with cloudfront.

When checking the TTL policy, it seems the max is some super high number, but the default TTL is 24 hours (it is shown in seconds).

Given this...why wouldn't I say want my max and default ttl to be 1 hour instead? I mean I'm guessing this means cloudfront makes a request to S3 bucket once an hour instead of every 24 hours. 

But I just don't really see the major downside to this? Is there additional costs I should be aware of if I did that? Is there a reason one would really want the default to be 24 hours? 

Just curious as now I have to wait 24 hours for the change to reflect in the cloudfront now. Thanks for any information.
