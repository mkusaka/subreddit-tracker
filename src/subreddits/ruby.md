Which one do you use / have recently decided for? And why?

What do you hate about the current ones that you (have to) use?

Did I miss an important one for the ruby ecosystem?

Is there any way to remove unused keys on Lingohub?

I'm just deleting a bunch of unused keys in the translation yml file. Is there any good and safe way to do this?

edit:

Answer from Lingohub team:

&gt;Hi xyz,LingoHub will automatically deactivate keys when they are removed from a file. So for example you had a file with the following keys:A B CAnd you then upload the same file with the keysA CThe B key would be deactivated and not shown in the editor or exported anymore.Please note, this behavior is changeable through project settings. So make sure you check them before.Hope that helps.Best,

This is a partial answer that I wanted. Can I somehow reverse these keys if the mistake is created?or create more environments?

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

&amp;#x200B;

I recently published an early version of [a small gem](https://github.com/pjambet/til-rb/) I've been working on to manage a "TIL repo", like [this one](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) that made the rounds recently. It essentially creates a new commit for you, using the GH API, with a new file containing the content of the new TIL, and maintains a table of content in the [README.md](https://README.md) file.

&amp;#x200B;

Building it was really interesting and [I wrote a post about it](https://blog.pjam.me/posts/til-cli/), thought it would be worth sharing here!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using it for a week or so, and while I'm sure it has a lot of bugs (almost total lack of validation on user input for instance), it has worked reasonably well so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you questions or feedback.

Hi there. I've been having this issue a while now. I graduated bootcamp and they used vagrant for teaching Rails development. That's what I'm used to. But I wanted to try to make my own Vagrant box to start my personal development environment instead of using the one the bootcamp provided. And the first project is going to be my Web Dev portfolio in Ruby on Rails.

Well now I'm running into issues installing the latest ruby version (or even the recommented one if you don't know what your'e doing which is 2.6.6 with devkit. (Not sure how I'd go about manually installing ruby with devkit in ubuntu from the terminal.)

I'm at the point where I'm ssh'd into my Vagrant box, and I'm trying to run the command rvm install 2.7.1 and it's throwing an error at me. I'm not sure how to determine exactly what's wrong, but here's the output after that command:

Here is my Vagrantfile, also. Pretty basic:

    Â Â Â rvmÂ installÂ 2.6.6
    Â Â Â gemÂ installÂ rails
    Â SHELL

config.vm.synced\_folder ".",Â "/vagrant\_files" config.vm.provider "virtualbox" doÂ |vb| vb.memoryÂ =Â "4096" end config.vm.provider "virtualbox" doÂ |vb| vb.cpusÂ =Â 8 end end

Any help will be greatly appreciated. I've been trying to get help on this and this is the furthest so far I think I've gotten besides this - I did get ruby and rails to install by running sudo apt-install ruby, which gives me a really old version, and then the same with Rails when I try to install that the same way, it gives me version 4.something when it's pas 6.0.3!

If I could just get a newer version of ruby working and I can install rails, then I'm set!

So im learning ruby and I found this strange file on my second monitor on the desktop all alone called [UnluckyWretchedTrust.zip](https://UnluckyWretchedTrust.zip). I scanned it for virus's and came back safe. So I unzipped and it has a main.rb file inside. it was created at 4am. So i open it in atom and it is the code I wrote for a blackjack game. Why was it named UnluckyWretchedTrust? That seems odd to me.
