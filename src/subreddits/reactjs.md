## [8][Generate and update value inside useEffect](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g0iwwf/generate_and_update_value_inside_useeffect/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g0iwwf/generate_and_update_value_inside_useeffect/
---
My problem is

I have two states

    const [firstValue, setFirstValue] = useState([]);
const [secondValue, setSecondValue] = useState([]);
    

and here is a function that generate random number (the value that I want twice)

      const random = (num, length) =&gt; {
        var arr = [];
        while (arr.length &lt; num) {
          var r = Math.floor(Math.random() * length) + 1;
          if (arr.indexOf(r) === -1) arr.push(r);
        }
        return arr;
      };

and after updating the firstValue inside useEffect i want the second value get the first value generated

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setFirstValue(random(5, 9));
    setSecondValue(firstValue);
 }, []);
    

but the `secondValue` remains empty, how can I update the `secondValue` **INSIDE** useEffect ?

here is the code

I created this website to help people on the front lines and to help increase social distancing: [**tp-report.com**](http://tp-report.com/)   Send it to anyone you know working at a grocery or supermarket or store so they can make a report. Check it to see if a place has toilet paper in stock.   It was super fun to build. I learned a lot. For the front end I used React, React hooks/redux, Apollo/GraphQL, Material Ui, and custom CSS. For the back end I used NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, Mongo DB Atlas, and GraphQL.

Hello everyone

i am new in react and trying to learn in my way. i coded something with little change but when i press delete button....it just delete everything. seems like reactjs is very sensitive to {} and \[\] type variables. i thin i messed something up in this case..... but i dun know why...

Aight as the title states. Lets say you have a authentication app with services.

So you log in, and you fetch the services. Then what is best practise? Refretch every refresh, and if you go to a single item, refetcht that single item from firebase.

Or is it best to save it in redux for example and only refresh on a change in firebase.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it doesn tmatter, because in both causes you do 1 firebase request right? So cost/request it doesnt matter
