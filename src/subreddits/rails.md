I recently asked the Rails community on Reddit the following [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fgcy4s/is_there_any_part_of_rails_you_wished_you/): Is there any part of [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) you wish you understood better? The most common answer was… testing.

Hey! I am building a social network for coders to share and interact called [Devolio](https://www.devol.io). It's still in its early stages so there isnt much content on the platform yet but I really want to grow it! I've open sourced [the code](https://github.com/Uzay-G/devolio) and I hope to build something for devs alongside other passionate devs. Please tell me what you think because it really means a lot!

I'm aware there's been topics like this, but they are at best 1 year old. Rails 6 came out since, webpacker is bundled in by default.

I am novice to working with React/JS (mostly some jQuery before), but I have a need to make an app for which jQuery/StimulusJS won't be enough (I tried).

My main question is:

**Should I use** `react-rails`, `react_on_rails` **or create two separate apps (Rails-BE, React-FE)?**

Seems that `react_on_rails`  had bad reviews here, but this was before Rails 6 with default webpacker. I'm also somewhat hesitant to go for the last options as communication done via JSON sounds like a bad choice performance-wise.  Thoughts?

I am looking into Stimulus Reflex and it looks nice, but I am trying to figure out what I could use it for. Are you using it in real apps? Thanks

I had a stint with Rails 5-6 years ago where I learned a ton and really came to love the framework. But around that time I started to get in to blockchain development and so my time with Rails was cut short. Now I'm in a position where I want to pick it back up because I remember what a pleasure it was, but it seems like the ecosystem is drying up. Searches on Pluralsight (free this month, btw) and other non-Rails specific sites are showing fewer and fewer results.  This makes me very nervous about investing time in learning it. I'll be looking for another development job here soon and I'm scared to focus on this (rather than say a python framework) if the outlook isn't so good. 

Am I missing something? I see there are a few jobs on SO and such but most of them seem to be looking for seniors (though they're paying quite well).  What are my chances here? How can I find a good Rails job with so little experience in it (obviously I'm going to build substantial project in it for my portfolio)? Should I even invest the time?

For some context, I'm very good with JS, so I know express / React / etc quite well. I just really enjoy working in Rails and would like to do that.

I have a worker that runs every night at midnight and attempts to retry a one\_time payment that has previously failed. After 7 retries, the payment is marked as unbillable and is not retried again.

Since stripe is creating a unique charge\_id for each retry, does this put my stripe account at risk?

Is there a smarter way to do this? Stripe has 'smart retry' but it seems to only apply to subscriptions.

I've recently changed jobs. After 2.5 years of mostly doing Rails API apps, I'm back to working on a HTML-rendering app.

This project has quite a lot of JS views. Are those still considered good practice or is it more of a legacy feature?

Thank you.

Hi. I have been using 'yarn add' to install js packages just fine since Rails 6. Today I read a tutorial for Stimulus, and the tutorial uses webpacker:install:stimulus to install the package. I am wondering is there any difference between the two, and are they interchangeable? Thanks in advance.
