I'm building a movie browser website. Users can click React Router links to display either "Popular / Upcoming / Now playing" movies, all coming from an API.

I know that having just one stateful parent component is best here, but what I have done is this:
https://i.gyazo.com/599eced0014d7d4a9f2b5debfeb60276.png

I have created three separate stateful components, each one using a different API call and then adding the JSON data to the state. I know this is not efficient, but I have no idea what I need to do to make it originate from one parent component.

I feel like I need some sort of "filter" but I don't know where to start. Does anyone have ideas?

Thanks

Hi all, just wondering if anyone has the experience of going from Apollo Client to urql for client side GraphQL?

I'm considering making the switch as I find the Apollo documentation hard to follow as it is not up-to-date (e.g. updateQuery is referenced as the way to update local cache after a mutation in several places, but in the actual code they have deprecated this in favor of typePolicies - which are woefully underdocumented). 

Relay seemed even more complex, but curious about urql. 5k stars on GitHub which is a third of what Apollo-client has, but still a lot...they have no issues submitted though compared to Apollo which has 600 opened issues plus their spectrum.chat posts

Hi, I'm doing my a mvp to prove a business idea. 

Been thinking of using firebase for some simple auth and db option, but is there any other simpler option you can recommend? 

Db will not store large amounts of data for each user.

Here comes the list of 398 remote jobs and you can filter them by location or skills.

Here I would like to share the entire remote jobs list from the big list of opportunities. All these are 100% remote jobs not just allowed to work from home during this crisis. These are 100% remote jobs and will continue to follow that after the crisis.

https://remoteleaf.com/whoishiring.   
Note: Select "javascript" in the skills filter to see javascript dev jobs.

‚úÖ 100% remote full-time jobs.
