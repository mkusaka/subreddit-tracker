We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Imagine you have a todo list app which is a react app. The todos are persisted in a database somewhere and the client fetches the todos from a REST API.

When the user creates a todo in the react app, 2 things happen:
+ the client sends a POST request to the REST api asking to add a todo to the database
+ if the request is successful, the todo is also added to the state of the react app so that react can do it's magic and represent it in the DOM.

Both actions could be called `addTodo`. How would you approach naming those ? I'm looking for names that would be both meaningful and represent the fact that one action adds the todo localy and the other adds the todo remotely.

Thanks

## [12][Difference Between React JS vs Angular JS](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fsc46a/difference_between_react_js_vs_angular_js/)

The primary difference between [AngularJS and ReactJS](https://www.aparajayah.com/web-development/react-js) lies in the state of its management. AngularJS has data binding bundled in by default, whereas React is generally augmented by Redux to give unidirectional data flow and work with immutable data. 

Prompt rendering is among the best features of React that gives a significant edge over Angular. The core difference between React JS and Angular JS. That React is JS-centric, while ng2 remains HTML-centric. JavaScript is far more robust than HTML, that makes React far more simple, focused and consistent. It's very common knowledge in the JavaScript community that Angular1/Angular2 has much larger API to learn than ReactJS +FLUX (combined). In Angular, in general, the learning curve is much steeper so that means that being efficient in that area of expertise is much harder than in React. Because ReactJS helps to prevent updating of DOM, it means that the apps will be faster and deliver better UX. ReactJS was designed to help improve the total rendered pages from the website server. Besides, it utilizes nodes to render on the client-side. React vs. Angular: Which one is easier. Angular is a full-featured MVC framework, developed and maintained by Google whereas React is an open-source JS library which is developed and maintained by Facebook. The toolchain in React is high as compared to Angular where it is low.
