We know that the JavaScript that we write in Node.js gets compiled to C++. We know that JavaScript that we write in Deno gets compiled to Rust.

My question is simple: instead of always using JavaScript as a wrapper, why can't JavaScript be extended to handle more low-level system type programming? To be clear, I'm not trying to be snark. I am genuinely curious why this hasn't been done yet. Are there some inherent problems that make this basically impossible? What are some of the challenges with doing this?

Hi, my requirement is upon refreshing or closing the browser tab, there should be my custom alert

instead of browser alert. I have to get this work done in typescript so I am returning the

$event.returnValue = false on beforeunload event which will stop my browser from closing or

refreshing but at the same time I want my custom pop-up to be shown instead of browser pop-up.

Here is my Code -

      @HostListener("window:beforeunload", ["$event"])
      beforeUnload($event: Event) {
    //loading my custom pop up
          $event.returnValue =false;
    }

My Custom Pop-up loads but loads after I cancel the browser popup-

&amp;#x200B;

[Browser Pop up](https://preview.redd.it/yk3gpe3j5hz41.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1448c4db23676aea55b105a78f5d930a523d859e)

&amp;#x200B;

How can I achieve this? what am I doing wrong? Please help.
