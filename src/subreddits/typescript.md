Hi, I recently migrated a vue project to typescript manually without cli, and I managed to set everything up except importing ts files. Somehow I need to specify the .ts on the import path.

Can someone please help?
## [4][Q: Using yarn workspace but Typescript isn't aware of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hpqnrm/q_using_yarn_workspace_but_typescript_isnt_aware/)

When I import something from an another workspace I get `Cannot find module @org/common/Movie or its corresponding type...` from the TS compiler/Intellisense. How can make TS aware of my workspace structure?
## [5][Type '"X"' does not satisfy the constraint 'keyof NamingOption'.ts(2344)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hpranq/type_x_does_not_satisfy_the_constraint_keyof/)

       protected combineAndSave &lt;NamingOption&gt;(
          audiosAndPauseFiles: Array&lt;string&gt;
          , savePath: string
          , fileNameOptions : 
             Pick&lt;NamingOption, "prefix"&gt; |
             Pick&lt;NamingOption, "name"&gt;
       ) : void {
    
    /*
    Type '"prefix"' does not satisfy the constraint 'keyof NamingOption'.ts(2344)
    Type '"name"' does not satisfy the constraint 'keyof NamingOption'.ts(2344)
    */

I'm still rough with generics, why isn't `NamingOption` being treated as amorphous in shape above? I thought that's the point of a generic type, maybe my concept of them is wrong, or maybe it's a syntax error.

PS: The intent of the above is that argument 3 receive an object with a single key, for either `prefix` or `name` (not both). I know an object union could also do this but I want to learn the generic type way.

       protected combineAndSave(
          audiosAndPauseFiles: Array&lt;string&gt;
          , savePath: string
          , fileNameOptions : {
             prefix?: string
             , name?: string
          }
       ) : void {
          const {prefix, name} = fileNameOptions;
          let finalFileSavePath: string;
          
          // used to save sentence files
          if (prefix) {
             finalFileSavePath = `${savePath}/${prefix} - ${this.sentence.folderName}.ogg`;
          } else {
             finalFileSavePath = `${savePath}/${name}`;
          }

I think there's a hole above. Looks like someone may be able to pass an empty object, or even exclude the 3rd argument completely, which would hit the `else` clause with an `undefined` variable and cause a `TypeError` (if this is wrong please let me know).

Is there any way to constrain the `fileNameOptions` object so that one of the keys must be specified?

I tried this

          , fileNameOptions : Partial&lt;{
             prefix?: string
             , name?: string
          }&gt;

But on review of the docs this apparently does nothing the dual `?` don't already do.

I may leave it anyways for code clarity, if anyone has an opinion on that please share.

## [8][Noob Question: how do I enforce the implementation of a static method on a child class?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hpj5h2/noob_question_how_do_i_enforce_the_implementation/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hpj5h2/noob_question_how_do_i_enforce_the_implementation/

I know I can do this

```
abstract class A {
  myMethod();
}

class B extends A {
    myMethod() {
        console.log("implemented");
    }
}
```

and I can do this

```
class B {
    static myProperty = "hello";

    static myMethod() {
        console.log("hello");
    }
}
```

but I can't seem to mix the two.

I want to make sure that all child classes of a parent (abstract) class override a certain static property (or method).

Specifically, I want all descendants of `FromSQL` to have a static property `TABLE_NAME`, so that I can have a method `fetch&lt;T extends FromSQL&gt;` and then use `TABLE_NAME` to fetch from the correct table.

Is there any way to do this? If not, is there a workaround I can use?
## [9]["--isolatedModules flag" in typescript](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hp440a/isolatedmodules_flag_in_typescript/)

&gt; All files must be modules when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided

I've googled this error but I honestly don't think I'm violating anything. 

    import React from 'react';
    import Hero from '../components/Hero';
    
    const About: React.FC = () =&gt; (
      &lt;Hero /&gt;
    );
    
    export default About;
    
The error occurs at "(1,1)"..so  the first character. 

I have an almost exactly similar file that doesn't produce the error. It is also super strange because when I was working on this file yesterday and saved it in this state, it was rendering fine. But right now as I run the app again..I get that error. Does anyone know what it could be?

One answer from S/O: This error happens when there is no import or export statement in a file (these make a file a module). But I do have an export statement..

Hi you! As the title says I need to create a new method and I know there is a prototype way but isn't encouraged.
I was told about wrapping and then I looked into the documentation and Stack Overflow but I couldn't find any clear explanation/answer.

I want achieve something like this:
numberInstance.myMethod(anyNumber)

Thanks for helping me !
## [11][How to share common typings in a project? [Lerna / Workspaces]](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hor78i/how_to_share_common_typings_in_a_project_lerna/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hor78i/how_to_share_common_typings_in_a_project_lerna/

I did bit of a searching and couldn't find a real example anywhere.  

I'm about to create a project (both backend and frontend) that might share common typings (especially models etc). I haven't set up the lerna yet (the only share-able components are these typings at the moment). What's the best way to organize this? Can someone shed some light on this?  

Ideally, I guess, this common types would export two modules (if I understand the `module`s correctly) that matches the package names of the frontend and backend packages.

It'd be great if I get some ELI5 on `module` vs `namespace`, and how to organize typings that spans across multiple files.

Thanks!  

Edit: Big thanks to u/intrepidsovereign for creating a [boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanChristian4427/example-monorepo-ts)
