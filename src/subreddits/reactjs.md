Hi r/reactjs this is my first post on here.

&amp;nbsp;

I built a React component [(link: react-see-through)](https://github.com/andrew4699/react-see-through) that lets you mask unimportant elements on your page. **This could be useful for a tutorial where you want users to focus on particular parts of your page.**

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of work went into making sure **this could be plugged anywhere into a big project and just work and not break layouts**. I was able to swap this in at random places in one of my big projects and had it work just fine. There's a picture of that at the top of the README. There are also [examples available here.](https://andrew4699.github.io/react-see-through/#basic-usage)

&amp;nbsp;

This is my first sizeable open-source project and **I would love feedback** on anything from feature requests to even code quality. Enjoy!

## [8][How to explain difference of thinking between React and traditional OO language](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fye9em/how_to_explain_difference_of_thinking_between/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fye9em/how_to_explain_difference_of_thinking_between/

TL;DR do you have good resources to help share the difference between traditional OO software development and modern React Applications?

Background:

The project is based on React+TypeScript.

My coworkers  come from a C#, Java, etc. background. They are used to develop big traditional applications, with Object Oriented good practices, Types, Classes, etc. They often tend to take their Objet Oriented background here, so wanting to create Classes, Types in separate files, and they tend to "think" a lot in the classic OO way.

On my side: I have less general dev experience than them (2years xp), but more in React/ JS/ TS. I can't say I'm officially the lead developer, but I did develop all the codebase for months before another dev (OO oriented) came along.

I have the feeling and I know that things are not done 100% the same in Java/C# and React, I know that you cannot think the same. But I lack the experience and the skills to share it in a efficient and clear way. I would be really glad if anyone have good links, articles, ideas, to help share the difference between OO oriented traditional Java/C#/C++ applications, and the modern and changing React and JS way of thinking.

Is there a basic UI framework that I can build my custom look on? Basically I'm looking for a library that already has the most components like datatables, date pickers etc. built-in but requires me to style it to fit the company brand identity?

Or would it be more beneficial to re-style an existing library like Bootstrap?
