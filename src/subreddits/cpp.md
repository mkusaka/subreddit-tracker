**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

I'm trying to setup `experimental::executor` preferably with clang-10 but two of the implementations ([this](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/executors) and [that](https://github.com/executors/executors-impl)) that I've tried, failed to build. The first implementation doesn't even offer CMake support, and is incompatible with current latest implementation of `std::future`.

Is there an available implementation which builds with clang-9 or clang-10? If not, then what's the best way to go about compiling and successful running a basic example of `experimental::executor`?

I am wondering if there is any situation in which a struct or class with one member would have a different size (using sizeof()) than the size of its member, assuming that the struct is not inheriting from any other class. Is this undefined behavior, or is it something that the standard guarantees to be true?

On a second note, I am also wondering if there is a portable way to determine at compile-time whether or not a struct has a single member or not, given that I know the name of that member and its size. Thanks for your help.

I'm in a bottomless pit of over-engineering that I don't want to get our out because it's way too much fun. Also, you can't go outside so what else is there to do. Here is a really cool thing I found.

I wanted to use my fancy compile-time alias for calculating summary byte size of multiple structures:

    template&lt;class ... Descriptions&gt;
    using summary_byte_size = std::integral_constant&lt;size_t, (Descriptions::byte_size::value + ...)&gt;;

It's not `sizeof()` because it's a description of data, not actual data. It carries no data, ok? Basically there are types that have required `byte_size` defined which is an `integral_constant` as well.

Problem is, I wanted to use it with a subset (first N actually) of variadic template arguments that I had. So I couldn't simply `Args...` them to this structure :( In moments like this you really want to think `std::tuple` so I did that. I made `std::tuple&lt;Args...&gt;`, then I put it into thing below to get `std::tuple` of only N first types from initial tuple:

    template&lt;std::size_t Count,Â typename Head,Â typenameÂ ...Â Rest&gt;
    struct tuple_of_first_nÂ {
        using typeÂ =Â decltype(std::tuple_cat(std::declval&lt;Head&gt;(),Â std::tuple_cat(std::declval&lt;Rest&gt;()...)));
    };
    
    template&lt;typename Head,Â typenameÂ ...Â Rest&gt;
    struct tuple_of_first_n&lt;0,Â Head,Â Rest...&gt;Â {
        using typeÂ =Â Head;
    };

Now - the actual core of this whole thing. How do I extract tuple types and push it to my `summary_byte_size&lt;&gt;` struct?

How to get `Ts...` from `Something&lt;Ts...&gt;`?

Introducing - *this abomination*:

    template&lt;typenameÂ Source, template &lt;typename...&gt; typenameÂ Target&gt;
    structÂ extract_types_and_apply{};
    
    template&lt;template &lt;typename...&gt; typenameÂ Source, template &lt;typename...&gt; typenameÂ Target, typename ...Â Ts&gt;
    structÂ extract_types_and_apply&lt;Source&lt;Ts...&gt;,Â Target&gt; {
        usingÂ typeÂ =Â Target&lt;Ts...&gt;;
    };

Basically we force it to pick *specialized* version so that `Ts...` is deduced and I can freely push it to anything I want that can accept these given `Ts...` args. And there we go!

    autoÂ totalSizeÂ =Â extract_types_and_apply&lt;std::tuple&lt;Vec3,Â Vec3,Â Vec2&gt;,Â summary_byte_size&gt;::type::value;

Here's another example how you can use it. It can be used to take a container and create another container with same type! Here I made `std::list&lt;int&gt;` from `std::vector&lt;int&gt;`:

    autoÂ actualListÂ =Â extract_types_and_apply&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;,Â std::list&gt;::type();

Here's Godbolt link if you want - [https://godbolt.org/z/zO711Q](https://godbolt.org/z/zO711Q)

If you want to pass values through template args like `std::size_t` then it's whole different story, because  neither `typename` nor `class` is `std::size_t`... but it works for types! Also, this is C++17. In C++20 you can basically do the same using single line templated lambda:  
`[&amp;]&lt;class ...Â Types&gt;(std::tuple&lt;Types...&gt;){ /*Â useÂ Types...Â howeverÂ pleasedÂ */ }(tuple_of_first_n&lt;2,Â std::tuple&lt;int, char, int, int&gt;&gt;::type{});`

I hope you like it :D
## [10][Preview of my second library, ESeed Window, window management library currently supporting Win32 and Vulkan, more to come](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3iae9/preview_of_my_second_library_eseed_window_window/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3iae9/preview_of_my_second_library_eseed_window_window/
---
Good day reddit folks! I hope everyone is safe! Not too long ago I posted my first library [ESeed Math](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fpum4g/eseed_math_my_first_c_library/)  on r/cpp, which got a greater response than I expected for such a small project! I was quite happy.

In any case, my second library [ESeed Window (GitHub)](https://github.com/elijaharita/eseed-window) has been in the works since then, and is finally in a functioning state! It's a C++ window management library designed for uniform cross-platform use with a variety of rendering APIs. The first supported API is Vulkan, as the platform-specific code is pretty simple. Thanks Vulkan! =) The first platform is Win32.

Why did I make a window library when we have GLFW and SDL? And SFML? And Qt? You know, that's a good question. I only have 1 and a half brain cells and I make myself do everything from scratch! In any case, although each of these libraries will accomplish the job they're designed for, I'm not quite happy with any of them. GLFW's Vulkan support is a lil hacky, and GLFW and SDL are both written in C, which does awkwardly stand out in C++ code. On the other side of the spectrum, SFML and Qt are much larger libraries. I just wanted a simple light weight C++ window library. If there is a library out there that's like what I'm looking for, that I just happened not to find... well, haha. hahahaha :')))))

A small list of supported features --

* Platform-agnostic window construction
* No nasty windows.h in the library's header files! yay!
* Title management
* Keyboard and mouse input (getters and callbacks)
* Cursor control
* Position and size management
* Fullscreen
* Unicode support
* Platform-agnostic Vulkan surface creation
* Event polling and waiting

Here is a code example to run a minimal window --

    #include &lt;eseed/window/window.hpp&gt;
    
    int main() {
        esd::wnd::Window window("Window!", { 1366, 768 });
        while (!window.isCloseRequested()) {
            window.waitEvents();
        }
    }

Creating a Vulkan surface is also very simple!

    #include &lt;vulkan/vulkan.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;eseed/window/vulkanwindow.hpp&gt;
    
    int main() {
        esd::wnd::VulkanWindow window("Vulkan Window!" { 1366, 768 });
        
        // Get required instance extensions for surface creation
        std::vector&lt;const char*&gt; extensions = 
            window.getRequiredSurfaceInstanceExtensions();
        
        vk::InstanceCreateInfo instanceCreateInfo;
        ...
        instanceCreateInfo.setEnabledExtensionCount((uint32_t)extensions.size());
        instanceCreateInfo.setPpEnabledExtensions(extensions.data());
        ...
        vk::Instance instance = vk::createInstance(instanceCreateInfo);
    
        // C VkSurfaceKHR is also supported, if you're into that kinda stuff : )
        vk::SurfaceKHR surface = window.createSurface(instance);
    
        ...
    
        while (!window.isCloseRequested()) {
    
            ...
          
            window.poll();
        }
    
        ...
    }

So, this is just a preview release. While I see no reason that it couldn't used in production code, it will currently only run on Windows. However, I'd like to change that! Adding additional platforms like MacOS and Wayland is going to be a lot of work for me, and I'm willing to do it. However, if anybody else finds this concept interesting, and would like to collaborate on adding additional platforms, let me know! If this library can make it to a more developed state, I'm sure there'll be plenty of people to benefit from it.

I am 17. I don't have much experience with writing open source libraries. I've done my best to create a useful piece of technology, but of course, for a large project such as this, assistance is very much appreciated &lt;3 Whatever the result, I'm proud of starting to be able to stay focused on a project without giving up. Everyone, thanks for reading, and enjoy your day!

## [11][Ssh2 client based on QTcpSocket and libssh2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3o01j/ssh2_client_based_on_qtcpsocket_and_libssh2/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3o01j/ssh2_client_based_on_qtcpsocket_and_libssh2/

For implementation ssh2 protocol in my [my open source](https://github.com/synacker/daggy) project I created [class for ssh2 connection](https://github.com/synacker/daggy/blob/master/src/DaggyCore/Ssh2Client.h).

This class supports:

1. Async signal slot interface
2. Ssh2 channels/processes

I searched any async C++ wrappers for ssh2 before and did't found.

Is there sense for implementing separate lib for ssh2 wrapper?

Thank you for attention!
