We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I can only think of two things: forwardRef and hooks. Are there other things that trip up junior and intermediate React devs? Or things junior or intermediate React devs think they know, but don't?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/erry3c/babel_780_released_we_can_now_use_ecmascript_2020/

New features include:

* The nullish coalescing operator.

`const name = person.fullName ?? "Anonymous";`  which reads "if person.fullName is `null` or `undefined`, then `name = "Anonymous"`.

Same as `||`, but for nullish values, instead of falsy ones.

&amp;#x200B;

* Optional chaining

`const city = person.address?.city; // person.address could be not defined`

&amp;#x200B;

* Dynamic `import()`

`import getTargets from "@babel/helper-compilation-targets";`

`getTargets({`

`browsers: ["last 2 chrome versions"],node: 10`

`}) == { chrome: "77.0.0", node: "10.0.0" }`

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to use them in my immediately Create React App application by upgrading `@babel/core` and `react-scripts`.

Hi all

I have understood the concepts of React. Components, Props, nesting, hooks, class/functional components and more. By themselves, I feel quite confident. Yet when I need to actually build something, I feel lost.....I am stuck and I feel that I understand the fundamentals of React well enough but when it comes to building something, I am so clueless.

What would you guys recommend? I am looking for simple beginner friendly projects that also give me their code, so that I can read and understand what is going on. All the projects I have googled are either too hard, or they are quite beginner friendly but do not give their source code.

Feeling sad and overwhelmed because I realize that I can't actually do anything with React....
## [12][useEffect set initial state warning: missing dependency](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/es90g4/useeffect_set_initial_state_warning_missing/)

I want to use useEffect as a componentDidMount replacement. So far I always have left the second array parameter empty and it was working fine. I have updated my create react app and now it tells me that 

&gt;React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency

It wants me to put the state inside the array of the second argument of useEffect. When I do this useEffect is triggered indefinitely (because it is updated every time when I set the initial data in its effect). What am i supposed to do here?

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      const response = fetchData...
      const data = setData(response.data...)
    }, []);
    // [data] warning disappears but code breaks
