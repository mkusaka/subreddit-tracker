tl;dr: lost interest in web dev, learnt Rails, have just completed rewriting my old homepage; thanks to the Rails community for helping me get through this.

---

Hi! Over the past month, I've completely rewritten my homepage from scratch, in Ruby using Rails. This was my very first real Rails project and I'm so proud that I can finally say that it's (nearly) completed.

I come from a background of many languages, but mostly php. Don't get me wrong, php is an awesome language and if you're interested in a typed scripting language with a Java-like OOP system, then php is probably your best bet.

I've been doing web development in my freetime for nearly 4 years now and I really lost interest lately. The only app that I was still maintaining was my homepage. It had a pretty old php code base from when I was a complete newbie to software development.

From side projects which I had long since discontinued, I gained much, much more knowledge in software development and became what I would consider to be quite a good developer. My homepage was my only project left that was not a library or small tool, and considering its age, I thought of rewriting it.

Long story short, I couldn't bring up the motivation. Started it a few times using different frameworks, but always discontinued the project after a few days. I think I just knew my stack too well and got bored of it. In the end, it was just repeating the same tasks I did a thousand times already, once again. I think you could say that I was in some kind of coding depression.

I came to the conclusion that I needed to learn a new framework or maybe even a whole new language. I tried PHP/Slim, PHP/Symfony (granted, that really was not new to me...), Python/Django and even a few more.

After looking for more frameworks to try, I found Rails. I already knew Rails (not really), because I dabbled with it around 2 years ago. Back then, I dropped it because I neither understood Rails nor Ruby. Having heard great things about Ruby and Rails and having seen the Ruby community as really friendly, calm devs whose projects "just work", I really got interested in it again.

I started learning Ruby using [the Programming Ruby book](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) and Rails using several YouTube tutorials and blogs. I felt as if Rails is the right thing for my homepage, so I started working on it (based off of a 45min YouTube video, even though the code base has completely changed since then).

After having understood Rails' basics (where does it get the views/layouts from, how does webpacker work, how do all the helpers work, how do I validate input, how do I query a database, ...), it became pretty easy and I could work on it all by myself, no tutorial needed anymore.

I still ran into quite some problems (looking through my post history, I made 9 posts on here over the past month), which I consulted you guys for. All my questions got answered! And this is just a big thank you to all of you! This community gave me a really warm welcome and I feel right at home here. I joined this sub when I started my Rails journey and in the future I'd like to help others new to Rails too. Rails has an incredibly awesome community.

Also, the people from Stack Overflow, numerous blogs around the web, YouTubers making tutorials and developers writing libraries, deserve all an equally big thank you. To me, it feels like those resources are often not appreciated as much as they should be.

My site is now live and I'm going to Open Source it very soon. I'd love to post a link, but I don't want my Reddit account to be associated with my homepage/IRL personality.

So, again, thank you to all of you! ;)

Hi!  


I am (very lately) going to start testing my little applicatin. I have been posponing that since it makes me unconfortable/I don't know well what I am doing.  


Can you point me out to a project reference in which I can study how it's done?  
I will use just minitest.

Thanks

Hi, every week I livestream some Ruby on Rails coding, building an app and looking at different approaches to features from a learners perspective. In recent weeks we [created our initial models and associations](https://youtu.be/vQjw5uUAx5k), last week we [added some forms along with `edit` and `update` actions on a controller](https://youtu.be/MWSngfjNKS0).

This week, I wanted to run through some different approaches for allowing admins (or any other type of user) to edit/update a model. We looked at where this type of behaviour can live inside your Rails app and then implemented one of the options.

Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbRw2jHpgg0

I'll add in some chapter markers as soon as I can to make this easier to navigate, I've already done some of the previous videos.

I usually stream 10:30am (UK Time) every Sunday. You can subscribe to [the YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6JPQW8LnAZyfC_rUZqDqqA) if you want to be reminded. Thanks!
## [6][Why not to use Rails on Windows?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/j4va9b/why_not_to_use_rails_on_windows/)

I'm starting to learn rails and heard a lot of recommendations to use it on Linux, but no one tells me exactly why. So, I prepared a setup on Ubuntu but tried to give a chance do Windows and made my first small api, with login system, etc... but couldn't spot any problem using Windows.

So, can anyone give me reason to drop Windows now instead of running into big issues later, or is it just some kind of a programmer tabu?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Also, I found it way easier to setup an developer environment to Rails on Windows than on Ubuntu, so I don't get the "configuration nightmare" that people tells about.
## [7][s3 signed urls question](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/j4qcxj/s3_signed_urls_question/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/j4qcxj/s3_signed_urls_question/

After uploading a file to S3 using Shrine and Uppy (which requires a presigned url), and saving its data to my model, I get to call `image_url` in image tags and such. However....something about having all that credential information as part of a url that I want to be a publicly readable file strikes me as sort of...odd? If my understanding is correct, and it's used for signing uploads, is there any reason why all this remains in the url? If I copy the image url from most sites, I do not see S3 credentials. Would this hurt me in any way?

I go to my console and type `model.image_url` (or just copy image url in the browser) and get this:

`https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/model/1/image/9457719e40fb416e01a153657d7ea4fb.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=###&amp;X-Amz-Credential=accesskey_date_region_s3aws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=###&amp;X-Amz-Expires=900&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=###`

Is it ok that X-Amz-Algorithm, X-Amz-Credential, X-Amz-Date, X-Amz-Expires, X-Amz-SignedHeaders, and X-Amz-Signature are public like this?

X-Amz-Credential is just my access key and date and such, so it doesn't seem harmful. But what about X-Amz-Signature?

And X-Amz-Expires...what is it that expires here? According to [this](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=284629) a value of 900 is equal to 15 minutes, however I've been able to view this image hours later. Why would I want this?

Hey, I promise you I've gone through all the posts on this subreddit I could find on this topic. I have some beginner questions as I've only dived into my first rails project in May (which is running just fine :D)

I now need to add proper authentication to it

I initially used Devise + a custom JWT strategy but that wouldn't work for me in the long run. Long story short, I need an Oauth mechanism for creating an Alexa Skill. 

Anyway, my confusions are :

1. In my app (a flutter one in this case) I would like to start off with a simple sign in with email and later scale to social logins. Can I do this without leaving the app (not going into the browser?)

2. If not, do I need to create a custom view in my API only rails app just for handling the login that I need to send my native app users to, to authenticate?

3. What is the redirect URI in this case for doorkeeper? 

I can figure out the omniauth bit and the specifics as and when it comes, but my fundamentals here in understanding this process keeping rails and doorkeeper in mind aren't clear. 

I will buy you a beer because this has been really stressful figuring out and because I love this community in general haha

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

I have a few custom UI components in my app, such as a dropdown menu. Writing those up manually every time I need one is not so cool, considering that it's quite a bit of HTML to write and if I need to update the dropdown markup once, I have to do it across many, many views.

Therefore, I wrote those two helpers: [\*click\*](https://gist.github.com/ImMaax/9d9c6ba45eba6664b87a43e0c93fa168)

Do you think this is a good approach or is it completely horrible? Pretty much my first time working with blocks in Ruby. Thanks a lot!

In my CMS I manage user editable templates that are stored in the database and retrieved with a custom template resolver. For these templates/views Rails' logs don't show rendering time like for the standard views. Is there a way to fix this? For example by hooking into ActionView LogSubscriber? Thanks!
