Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

It doesn't seem like it would be too complex (following `std::lock_guard`) to have a type that does acquire/release. But cppreference has no mention of such a type. Was it considered for the standard?

## [8][abbreviated class templates?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/eoiscy/abbreviated_class_templates/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/eoiscy/abbreviated_class_templates/
---
since we now have abbreviated function templates in c++20 (with concepts), I wonder if we could have something similar for structs/classes, concretely

&amp;#x200B;

`struct test {`

`auto x;`

`auto y;`

`test(auto _x, auto _y) : x{ _x }, y{ _y } {}`

`};`

`auto obj = test{ 1, "aaa"s };`

`// _x deduced to int, _y deduced to std::string as function template deduction for the ctor.`

`// obj.x then deduced to int since it is initialized by _x, and _x is int, likewise for obj.y`

the whole thing should be equivalent to

`template&lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt;`

`struct test {`

`T1 x;`

`T2 y;`

`template&lt;typename T3, typename T4&gt;`

`test(T3 _x, T4 _y) : x{ _x }, y{ _y } {}`

`};`

`template&lt;typename...T&gt;`  
`test(T...)-&gt;test&lt;T...&gt;;`

I have implemented a simplified header-only library to help make performing volatile read and writes easier in C++ codebases.
Really handy especially if you're into embedded systems.

It's a few lines but well documented and won't have to repeat yourself nor use the volatile keyword irresponsibly again. 

More documentation and justification on the repo. 

Contributions and reviews are highly welcome too ðŸ˜€

Why is there a seemingly big discrepancy of existing and used c++ version? Despite good compiler support.

When I see the new features of current c++ currently (17 and even 20 has wide compiler support already) i am amazed.

But in reality:
Open recent and active c++ project on github.
Itâ€™s 98 or 11 in the best case
Why on earth is every c++ code I (with my limited horizon) find in the wild uses such old standards?
Also clang uses c++98 as default setting. Which is somewhat okay, because it can be easily adjusted. But itâ€™s weird nonetheless.
