We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I was a developer for my entire career and my new position will barely allow me to code on the project anymore (words from the previous teammate in this position). This is my first time as a lead and I'm scared of not keeping up with the good stuff.

Hello everyone! I am a Junior React dev and recently I got placed in a team as a solo front end developer.

I made in the past a couple of other projects made in CRA but they were hosted on a different FTP server.

Now I need to create the front end that is in the same back end project structure (spring application) and the output .war will be just 1. Should I still use the CRA or maybe I should dive into other libraries (gatsby or next) as I have like 1 week of studying before getting hand on the code.

Thanks in advance!

This post attempts to offer a jargon-free answer to the following questions:

* Why do frameworks like React &amp; Vue use Virtual DOM?
* What is Virtual DOM?
* What problem does it solve?
* Does it make rendering to the UI faster or slower?

====================================

Note - I'm trying to improve my tech writing (make it jargon free to explain fundamentals). So, if you have feedback about the post from that perspective - kindly share.

Hello redditers!

I'm new to reactjs, but can do alot of things in HTML, CSS and Javascript. React is very interesting IMO, but there are some things I can't seem to get. 

I'm trying to add animations to my components (scroll reveal, appear on click, etc.) and I found some tutorials on useState, useRef and useEffect, but i don't seem to fully understand how they work.

So I'm looking for some tutorials that will describe them, or someone that can mentor me a little bit.

Any help is much appriciated!
Thank you, wonderful people of reddit
