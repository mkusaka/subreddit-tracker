I have just finished the "Creating Well-tested Applications In Golang" course on Pluralsight and the topic of fuzzing came up. It looks a really interesting topic and I am keep to put it to use. Does anyone here use it often? If so what type of functionality do you test?

I have written an article on how to implement the HealthChecks for the gRPC containers in Kubernetes. Provide your comments.

We've created a headless video player and a testbed framework for the evaluation of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) algorithms, protocols and so much more...

We've had a lot of fun writing this HAS video player, over the last year.  Hope you enjoy it

I wanted to replicate papers-with-code and I came up with this.

Feel free to comment and contribute.
