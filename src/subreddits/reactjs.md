We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hola,

My cousin was laid off during the pandemic and has the time and resources to invest in making a career change. I have felt it upon myself to help him in his journey and I'm really proud of what he has been able to achieve in just 5 weeks. I want to give an open invitation to anyone that might be interested in learning a specific concept or technology. PM me or reach out to me via Youtube.

Hey all,  

I'm happy to share with you my latest open-source project [use-count-up](https://github.com/vydimitrov/use-count-up). This is a React/React Native component and hook to animate counting up or down to a number.  Â 

[use-count-up](https://github.com/vydimitrov/use-count-up)Â is thought to be a [lightweight](https://bundlephobia.com/scan-results?packages=use-count-up@latest,react-countup) alternative to the famousÂ [react-countup](https://github.com/glennreyes/react-countup) with built-in support for `toLocaleString` number formatting. It hasÂ declarative API _(no more imperative calls to `start()` and `update()`)_ and is built with React and TypeScript for React and React Native apps.  

Hope you like it!

I am looking for open source React repositories so that I can learn from them. So far I have found the Spectrum chat one ([https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum)) to be really useful. I was wondering if there are any others the community have found useful.

I am learning to code on my own so I've this to be the best way I can learn how other people go about programming.

Hi all,

I would like to share this link for anyone learning React through the brad Traversy course on udemy.

Basically Brad says that the way the hooks are introduced and explained in this course  are not the  best way they should be used.

The course came out when react was still new so lots of things were still unlearned.

I am still going through this file and i am struggling to understand some of it, but once i start changing the code i might be in a better position.

Hopefully this will help out anyone who is currently doing the course as i am and was finding some of hooks usage to be a bit unusual.

If anyone cares to help to give us a hand as to why we shouldn't have functions that change the state inside the stateContext file would be of great help!

My thinking is that it causes react to do unnecessary renderings?

## [12][How do I interact with a site which uses React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gmo51w/how_do_i_interact_with_a_site_which_uses_react/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gmo51w/how_do_i_interact_with_a_site_which_uses_react/
---
I had some Scripts to interact with a specific website to automate some tasks. That site has ported its code to React JS and they stopped working.

Now things like changing the value of the input fields do nothing. Well, it changes the value, but it doesn't trigger the logic behind it, therefore for example, the buttons to submit something keep disabled (and is not as easy as just enabling manually the buttons).

I tried dispatching different events, like "keydown", but for security reasons it seems the browser doesn't allow that event to change the actual value of the fields.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.
