I kid you not i got over 50 chats/pms and i wasn't even mad, it was interesting to work on so many different stuff that took me almost no time and i could do from my office after finishing my work.   I started answering every chat/pm in order telling them to send the files to one of my emails so i could keep track of everything and to make communication easier in general. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 2-3 projects where everything went well i wrote after every email that i was accepting tips in general if they were happy with what i did but that it wasnt mandatory or even encouraged to do so, but it would help a lot (Living in Southamerica i kinda make a dollar an hour lmao)   Most of the people didn't mention it and just thanked me for the translation and that was cool, there was two or three that sent some tips to my paypal account (That is the same email i was using to manage all of this) but at least 5 people went furious about just reading the word \"Tip\" at the botton of the email in italics and light gray. I swear it was almost invisible.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe work was done, the translation was complete and i even modified some terms to make it more user friendly (after asking them ofc) the files were in the very same email where i was telling them that they could tip me if they wanted to but i just got called a scammer and that i wasn't really doing anything \"For free\" because then i was asking for money and if i wanted charity then i should go to the church.   Well i ignored that because that kind of people is everywhere and my main goal was (Is) to help indie dev reach new regions but then this guy wrote me.  \n\n\nHe wanted a \"Simple translation\" of a moneymaking app that was based on crypto and i thought it was one of those silly games that give you 0,00001 cent per win or something like that, but after i sent him the files he kept sending more and more and i ended up with about 6-7 big strings files which to me made no sense at all. i wrote to him asking wtf was happening and that i was just offering a small translation not this kind of work and somehow he slipped that he was making a new game/crypto app that function as a wallet but not really because he keeps the private keys and there is no way to redeem the \"Gems\" users won. I refused to keep working on this and again i got insulted and told me that it was irresposible to accept a job offer and not even finish it. I asked him for $20, just to see what he would tell me. And of course he started telling me that i was a scammer and stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I kind of gave up after that. But i picked up three more emails and they were really blessed. The first one was kind of a tic-tac-toe game that was really easy to translate and the game was really fun, i even played it with my coworkers.   Then a flashlight that i didn't use and just translated the appstore description (He tipped me about $6 and was the first and only one to do so even thought it was one of the most easy translation i had) and then a guy with a Military app to identify ranks. This last one was really interesting because i had to do a lot of research to properly translate ranks, i called a friend from the UN and the guy was just nice af. Im waiting a response for him rn because it looked like he wanted to continue the project and im on board 100%, it was really fun.  \n\n\nSome people even got mad when i asked to see the app so i could see the context of what i was translating and it was just ridiculous.  \n\n\nBut yeah, i finished the last one and the ones i had on reddit (One guy didn't even say hello, he just sent a message saying \"Translation\" and a walltext about a game that i didnt even read) got ignored.  \n\n\nSo if someone wants anything translated to spanish, hit me up. But remember that i have a full time job and i cant make everything in a few hours, im just trying to help. Not only here but in life in general, i think that rough times need helping people.  **You can send me the files to ironkunst@gmail.com** and write what you need and if you don't have the app in the appstore at least try to explain it to me because otherwise probably the translation would make no sense if its a weird game/lifestyle app.  \n\n\nI don't ask for money, you can tip but as i said its not necessary at all. Just a \"Thank you\" email back is enough and im open to modify whatever sounds/looks weird once i can see the app working.  \n\n\nOk this was a full rant but im sorry, i really can't talk about this to anyone because i always get \"They why aren't they paying you? You should start charging for it\" If the wording sound weird, im high af on benzos. The stress that this gave me and the work combined were just killing me.  \n\n\nIf one of you who acted like a dickhead is reading this, there is no hard feelings at all, everyone else who i had the honor to work with is welcome to just email me to chat. I sent a lot of notes with the translations and i can help even more if you need them, again free of charge. \n\nThanks for reading, i love you all and i wish you the best.", "author_fullname": "t2_i03et", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Free Spanish/English translation [Update/Rant]", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/androiddev", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_hchtcl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1592666921.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.androiddev", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, im high on benzos because of the stress everything in my life is causing me right now and i know its not the way to get through them but its what work for now so i copied this rant from the discord server, im sorry if you cant understand anything as i said im on a (6mg kpin) benzo high&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And im really sorry for the walltext and i know that this possibly will get deleted but i really need to vent because im still receving messages.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago i posted about doin free translations EN/ES for small apps and i was expecting a bunch of strings files and maybe some random stuff.   I kid you not i got over 50 chats/pms and i wasn&amp;#39;t even mad, it was interesting to work on so many different stuff that took me almost no time and i could do from my office after finishing my work.   I started answering every chat/pm in order telling them to send the files to one of my emails so i could keep track of everything and to make communication easier in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 2-3 projects where everything went well i wrote after every email that i was accepting tips in general if they were happy with what i did but that it wasnt mandatory or even encouraged to do so, but it would help a lot (Living in Southamerica i kinda make a dollar an hour lmao)   Most of the people didn&amp;#39;t mention it and just thanked me for the translation and that was cool, there was two or three that sent some tips to my paypal account (That is the same email i was using to manage all of this) but at least 5 people went furious about just reading the word &amp;quot;Tip&amp;quot; at the botton of the email in italics and light gray. I swear it was almost invisible.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The work was done, the translation was complete and i even modified some terms to make it more user friendly (after asking them ofc) the files were in the very same email where i was telling them that they could tip me if they wanted to but i just got called a scammer and that i wasn&amp;#39;t really doing anything &amp;quot;For free&amp;quot; because then i was asking for money and if i wanted charity then i should go to the church.   Well i ignored that because that kind of people is everywhere and my main goal was (Is) to help indie dev reach new regions but then this guy wrote me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted a &amp;quot;Simple translation&amp;quot; of a moneymaking app that was based on crypto and i thought it was one of those silly games that give you 0,00001 cent per win or something like that, but after i sent him the files he kept sending more and more and i ended up with about 6-7 big strings files which to me made no sense at all. i wrote to him asking wtf was happening and that i was just offering a small translation not this kind of work and somehow he slipped that he was making a new game/crypto app that function as a wallet but not really because he keeps the private keys and there is no way to redeem the &amp;quot;Gems&amp;quot; users won. I refused to keep working on this and again i got insulted and told me that it was irresposible to accept a job offer and not even finish it. I asked him for $20, just to see what he would tell me. And of course he started telling me that i was a scammer and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of gave up after that.

Not even a massive spike in downloads, just an indication that the translations were being noticed and recorded.\n\nCheers all :)", "author_fullname": "t2_8jo4z9h", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How long does it take to see the results of ASO localisation?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_hciasq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1592669441.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.gamedev", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone who has implemented ASO localisation to their App Store page give me any indication on how long it took you to start seeing results?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I implemented ASO localisation last night and while I know it\u2019s far too early to see any results for my app yet, I was wondering how long it took for others to see results.
