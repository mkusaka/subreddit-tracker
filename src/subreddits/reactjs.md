We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I started self-learning back-end in 2017 and front-end in 2018&amp;19 and full stack in late 2019-2020 on and off.And programming as a hobby since kid.I now have an opportunity to work in my first paid project which is an e-commerce web app so am really excited.

...............

I learnt the MERN stack and in the finishing stage of my first portfolio e-commerce project,which I followed some bits initially from a react udemy course but then changes various things and added a lot of features.It took me 3 months as I was learning while doing it but this new project should take less time than that but am kinda scared.

Deadline of the project is in 1 month.Client wants a grocery store of a relatively small scale.
As I can work with MERN, I am going with it and think it is a good stack to work on for that app along with redux-thunk.

.................

How would you aproach the project ?

And how much time should it take ?

Thanks you for your much appreciated help !

## [7][I made a thing: Kinetic Components - Animate a single React component or orchestrate animations among a collection of React components. Use CSS animations or your favorite JS animation library!](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gougxz/i_made_a_thing_kinetic_components_animate_a/)

The playground: [erhathaway.github.io/kinetic-components/](https://erhathaway.github.io/kinetic-components/)  
The repo: [https://github.com/erhathaway/kinetic-components](https://github.com/erhathaway/kinetic-components)  


I dread adding animations to apps b/c they get so unwieldy fast. The aim of Kinetic Components was to create an API that is, in my mind, ideal for controlling animations in React. It lets you easily add and orchestrate animations among multiple components. For example, if a drawer slides open, components inside the drawer can have micro animations. Kinetic can be used to easily orchestrate the micro animations on drawer show and hide! Furthermore, you can go beyond the simple enter / exit animations that most libs facilitate. A single component can have 3+ animations - the sky is the limit!

For example, give an example:

```js
// ListItem.tsx
interface Props {
    onTouchStart: (e: React.TouchEvent) =&gt; void;
}

const ListItem: React.FC &lt;Props&gt; = (props) =&gt; {
    const handleTouchStart = (e: React.TouchEvent) =&gt; {
        // Call the incoming function inside the component
        props.onTouchStart (e);
        // perform some other operations
    }

    return &lt;div onTouchStart = {handleTouchStart}&gt; &lt;/ div&gt;
}

export default ListItem;
```

```js
// ListItem.test.tsx
import {createElement} from 'rax';
import renderer from 'rax-test-renderer';

it ('Test ListItem TouchStart', () =&gt; {
    const mockFunc = jest.fn ();
    const component = renderer.create (&lt;ListItem onTouchStart = {mockFunc} /&gt;)
    const tree = component.toJSON ();
    tree.eventListeners.touchstart ();
    // report an error
    expect (tree.eventListeners.touchstart).toHaveBeenCalled ();
})
```

```js
expect (received) .toHaveBeenCalled ()

    Matcher error: received value must be a mock or spy function

    Received has type: function
    Received has value: [Function handleTouchStart]
```
