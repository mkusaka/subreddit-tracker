This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Like most developers, I use my own projects as a sandbox for exploring new stuff.I would like to open source my app, which has more than 50.000 downloads.It does use generic abstractions of architecture components, Room, Koin, LiveData, Fragments, Kotlin Coroutines, AndroidX and more. Hopefully it might be a helpful material for new devs. Source code can be found here: [https://github.com/edgar-zigis/Paleontologas](https://github.com/edgar-zigis/Paleontologas)

So I have an app that I want to make available for users but that also needs to be able to give admin privileges to some users, maybe only me.

I know that in web dev you could just have an account with Admin privileges show a custom dashboard, so would something similar to that work in Android? Maybe It'd be better to create 2 apps for the purpose (one for users and one for admins)? Or would back-end dashboards(WordPress/Azure/Firebase Console) management be the best way? 

What would be the most proper way to accomplish this as per best practices and flexibility in Android? I am using Kotlin, AAC and MVVM.
## [6][Session - A Signal protocol fork with decentralized servers and no need for a phone number](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f4z4tu/session_a_signal_protocol_fork_with_decentralized/)

 r/androidapps suggest I cross-post this...

Session is a cross-platform, anonymous and decentralized messaging application. You don't need a phone number or email address to make an account.

Session uses the Loki Service Node network to route the data, for which the nodes are rewarded with $LOKI. The Loki Network itself is made up of some \~1000 community operated Service Nodes where 44% of the supply is held in the SNs - about US$7.5 million at the moment.

I love Signal, but I don't love the attached phone numbers or central servers, but I know there's a challenge in allowing an altruistic intention over a financial incentive for the node operators - Sybil resistance. By using Loki's Service Node network, the crypto-economics is designed in a way that a bad actor would drive the price exponentially up while trying to accumulate enough Loki to be able to perform any traffic analysis on the routed data.

Think of it as a Signal fork meets a Monero fork meets an incentivized TOR network.

Just saw that the S20+ and S20Ultra will have a dedicated depth sensors. Would love to develop utilizing this.

I am making a survey to benchmark my fill rate. I'm with my banners close to 100 percent, but with my interstitials around 70-80 percent. Seems there is a lot of unused potential for monetization.

I am trying to follow an online tutorial to see how okhttp works for requests in android studio using kotlin.

I have managed to implement it successfully for when the request is good.

However when the request is unsuccessful (invalid search by the user, api not working properly, too many requests etc.) My app just crashes and closes down.

How can I edit my code so the error is handled properly and the app doesn't have to shut down.

example:

The user enters a key that is not valid so the api request fails.

I don't want the app to close but a toast to pop up saying "check your input is valid".

How can I do this?

    val url = "www.google.com"
    
            val request = Request.Builder().url(url).build()
            val client = OkHttpClient()
    
            client.newCall(request).enqueue(object : Callback {
                override fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {
                   //code if request is successful.
    
                }
    
                override fun onFailure(call: Call, e: IOException) {
                    //code if request was unsuccessful
                }
            })
