Hi

I've had a casual interest in game making my whole life and I want to try building mobile games. I don't have much experience in programming, just a little bit of python from 2 years back and some basic BATCH from a few years back.

Is Kotlin powerful enough to build small arcady games with?

Hi everyone,

I've had an ambition to learn to make apps. However with covid and everything the android dev market here in the Netherlands is saturated. So I thought I'd learn to code server side in kotlin since I've spent 100 hours in android kotlin tutorials. When the Android market grows again I'll at least have some experience with the language.

I don't know where to start though. Anyone have any ideas for a beginning developer?

What am I missing that would make my life easier?

So, I write C++ and occasionally some Java (a desktop Swing application) for a living. Been thinking about trying out Kotlin for a while, finally found a reason: Compile &amp; patch [https://github.com/manuelsc/HDDFs-MPG-Dumper](https://github.com/manuelsc/HDDFs-MPG-Dumper)

I got to say, Kotlin kicked my ass today. It wasn't even the language that did it for me. It's Maven and the build tools. The IDEs did not help.

So I tried Eclipse, loaded in the Kotlin plugin, made a Kotlin project, set it as a Maven thingy and BAM, Kotlin dependencies disappeared. WTF. Mind you I've never used Maven (I'm quite happy with Ant, and I loath Make, MsBuild is pretty bad). Googled for help, found a terrible tutorial. Eclipse will crap out Ant scripts on demand, it should be able to do the same for Maven. I decided that maybe Eclipse's shitty Kotlin-Maven support was a sign I should try something else. 

So I looked at the .gitignore file, it mentioned IDEA project files, so I'm like "welp it's about time I tried out Intellij again" I've used Eclipse for all of my Java development (it's the only thing Eclipse is good at). The nice thing about Eclipse is you can mostly ignore dependency problem, just put the jars in a folder and pull them into the project dependencies. What you see is what you get. Unless I completely missed it Intellij, completely lacks anything remotely useful to help new users out with Maven. I've been thrown into the deep end of Maven. Finally dropped the dependencies in and... The Maven Central site Intellij tried to pulled the dependencies from didn't have it. I couldn't even figure out what to google for that one.

So I went back to Eclipse, made a new project, not a Maven Project, and downloaded the jars from Maven Central, added them as dependencies to the Java project, Eclipse was happy. No errors, no unhappy squiggles. And then I tried to launch it. org.jetbrains.kotlin.ui.console is like "ERROR: Unresolved reference: java (3, 8)" along with pages more of errors like it can't find jack shit. Regular console is like "Error: Could not find or load main class MainKt"

Anyway, suggestions?

Hi, I shared our experience with building a CLI app using Kotlin MPP and automating the entire release with Github Actions.

 Hello, so i'm quite new to kotlin and i'm building a really simple app for a little project of mine.  
So the issue is: **I really need to find a way to either exchange a variable between uiThread and main thread or execute an ArrayAdapter on the uiThread**, which it doesn't let me to ( as i'm pulling my array from JSON objects on the internet) If someone is able to help me I'd be really grateful

I cannot get any sort of random number function to work in Kotlin, for the life of me. It's quite frustrating. Can someone show me an easy way?
## [9][Looking for advice to build a RESTful server written in kotlin on my raspberry pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/imerkm/looking_for_advice_to_build_a_restful_server/)

I have a lot of kotlin experience through Android dev and I absolutely love the language. I have a raspberry pi sitting around and I thought it would be neat as a fun side project to build a local server and app to communicate with each other.

I've been trying to decide on a framework to use but I haven't found any solid documentation and every project seems a bit different. I don't have much knowledge when it comes to web frameworks like spring or ktor so I'm not sure what I need.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading!
## [10][Calculator library (pure Kotlin module)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/imegl1/calculator_library_pure_kotlin_module/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/imegl1/calculator_library_pure_kotlin_module/

Many apps have number inputs, and in many cases, having a calculator function to provide the number inputs is desirable. This is my first time to publish a library, and hope you will find this helpful. Any feedback is much appreciated. To import:

    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.jairrab:KotlinCalculator:1.0.0'
    }

To get an instance of the `Calculator` library, call `Calculator.getInstance()` and pass a listener to receive calculator updates.

    class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), Calculator.Listener {
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    
            val calculator = Calculator.getInstance(this)
        }
    
        override fun onCalculatorUpdate(key: String?, entries: List&lt;String&gt;, result: Double) {
            Log.v("CALC", "key: $key | entries: $entries | result: $result")
        }
    }

`Calculator.getInstance()` returns a `Calculator` interface that provides the following functions:

    calculator.clear()
    calculator.pressOne()
    calculator.pressTwo()
    calculator.pressThree()
    calculator.pressFour()
    calculator.pressFive()
    calculator.pressSix()
    calculator.pressSeven()
    calculator.pressEight()
    calculator.pressNine()
    calculator.pressZero()
    calculator.pressDecimal()
    calculator.pressPlus()
    calculator.pressMinus()
    calculator.pressMultiply()
    calculator.pressDivide()
    calculator.backSpace()
    calculator.pressEquals()

The `Calculator.Listener` receives updates when a calculator function is called. Here's an example of a sequence of calculator operations and it's resulting logs:

    I/CalculatorLog: Key: initializing | Entries: [] | Result: 0.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: 1 | Entries: [1] | Result: 1.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: 2 | Entries: [12] | Result: 12.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: 3 | Entries: [123] | Result: 123.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: backspace | Entries: [12] | Result: 12.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: + | Entries: [12, +] | Result: 12.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: 1 | Entries: [12, +, 1] | Result: 13.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: 3 | Entries: [12, +, 13] | Result: 25.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: * | Entries: [12, +, 13, *] | Result: 25.0
    I/CalculatorLog: Key: 2 | Entries: [12, +, 13, *, 2] | Result: 38.0

The calculator is a pure Kotlin module library and does not have any Android dependency, thus you will need to provide a UI to call the and display the calculator functions.  This makes the library lightweight and very flexible to suit your needs. See the link below for a sample UI.

Note: The calculator library currently only supports MDAS operation. That is, it prioritizes multiplication and division over addition and subtraction as shown on the image above.
