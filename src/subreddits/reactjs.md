Following is my sample code when using context

&amp;#x200B;

I have created a class called createDataContext which has following code 

&amp;#x200B;

`import React, { useReducer } from "react";`  
`export default (reducer, actions, defaultValue) =&gt; {`  
 `const Context = React.createContext();`  
 `const Provider = ({ children }) =&gt; {`  
 `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, defaultValue);`  
 `const boundActions = {};`  
 `for (let key in actions) {`  
 `boundActions[key] = actions[key](dispatch);`  
`}`  
 `return (`  
 `&lt;Context.Provider value={{ state, ...boundActions }}&gt;`  
 `{children}`  
 `&lt;/Context.Provider&gt;`  
`);`  
  `};`  
 `return { Context: Context, Provider: Provider };`  
`};`  


Following is the code for one of my context 

&amp;#x200B;

`const authReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {`  
 `switch (action.type) {`  
 `case "error":`  
 `return {`  
`...state,`  
`...{ loading: false },`  
`...{ errorMessage: action.payload }`  
`};`  
 `case "customerMobileNumberLogIn":`  
 `return {`  
`...state,`  
`...{ data: action.payload },`  
`...{ loading: false },`  
`...{ errorMessage: "" }`  
`};`  
   
 `case "inProgress":`  
 `return { ...state, ...{ loading: true }, ...{ errorMessage: "" } };`  
 `default:`  
 `return state;`  
  `}`  
`};`

&amp;#x200B;

`const customerMobileNumberLogin = dispatch =&gt; {`

`..do api call with axios` 

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

`export const { Provider, Context } = createDataContext(`  
 `authReducer,`  
  `{`  
 `customerMobileNumberLogin`  
  `},`  
  `[]`  
`);`  


&amp;#x200B;

I am using ReactRouter

`import { Provider as AuthProvider } from "./context/AuthContext";`

`ReactDOM.render(`  
 `&lt;AuthProvider&gt;`  
 `&lt;Router&gt;`  
 `&lt;RootWithAuth /&gt;`  
 `&lt;/Router&gt;`  
 `&lt;/AuthProvider&gt;,`  
 `document.getElementById("root")`  
`);`  
Now suppose I have many api calls and I decide to create separate context file for each api call, won't this approach slow down my app?The context api is causing the same problem as redux. I am not 100 percent sure if this is the right way of doing things but I followed Stephen Grider udemy React Native course for using this approach in Reactjs as well.

*I hope this is related enough to React.js, I don't know a sub where I can post text where it would fit better.*

I'm working on a React project based on Next.js, using TypeScript and styled-components. I've just implemented Storybook as a system to test my UI components. I am also trying out some testing, but I'm really new to it and I know just the basics. 

I would like to be able to automatically run all my tests when I commit to a feature branch, and if it's possible some sort of canceling/failing the commit if the tests fail. I would also like to prevent merging of a feature branch into master if the tests have failed.  I heard about CI systems but I don't know where to start. Should I use CircleCI? Where do I get started? Are there any developers willing to advise me on where to get started with this? I work on all my projects alone and I use GitHub. Thanks in advance!

Live streaming an app for my future twitch streams. The app is a soundboard that can be managed on the computer and then the sounds can get triggered from the phone. I want to make it so it can be added as a browser source in obs and streamlabs. Usually I get a few friends on here to help answer my questions and others. Come join in. help out or sit back and learn a bit. [https://twitch.tv/jamie\_337\_nichols](https://twitch.tv/jamie_337_nichols)

Clock found here: [http://demo1.downloader.tech/](http://demo1.downloader.tech/) 

This clock app is really impressive to me, like, it's beautiful. I'd like to know how it works.

The code for the app can be found here:  [https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners/react-js-compass-clock.html](https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners/react-js-compass-clock.html)

It's only 125 lines of React code and 115 lines of CSS. I don't know how to read all of it though. Can someone explain? It looks pretty complicated so maybe explaining in written English is too big of a challenge...

I understand almost all of the individual lines of code but I don't get how it all comes together. The presence of the $ symbol in the code also confuses me -- I don't know what it does.

I also see this line as being particularly important yet hard to understand: 

    array = length =&gt; Array.from({length}).map((v, k) =&gt; k).map(x=&gt;x+1);
## [12][Uploading DICOM (dcm) files from React App to django server](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/en37bo/uploading_dicom_dcm_files_from_react_app_to/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/en37bo/uploading_dicom_dcm_files_from_react_app_to/
---
Hi there,

I need help with uploading a dataset of dicom files from my React App to a Django server.

The hierarchy of the files are as follows:

&gt;main/  
&gt;  
&gt;title/setOne/view  
&gt;  
&gt;1.dcm  
2.dcm  
&gt;  
&gt;title/setTwo/view  
&gt;  
&gt;1.dcm  
2.dcm

&amp;#x200B;

So the use case is that the user is going to upload the "main" directory and a script is supposed to generate the final list of objects to be posted to the server.

Example of request needed to be sent to server:

&gt;Array of objects  
&gt;  
&gt;The objects contain name of set and an array of files.  
&gt;  
&gt;`[`  
&gt;  
&gt;`{`  
&gt;  
&gt;`"name": setOne,`  
&gt;  
&gt;`"scans": [`  
&gt;  
&gt;`{"scan_image": 1.dcm},`  
&gt;  
&gt;`{"scan_image": 2.dcm}`  
&gt;  
&gt;`]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`},`  
&gt;  
&gt;`{`  
&gt;  
&gt;`"name": setOne,`  
&gt;  
&gt;`"scans": [`  
&gt;  
&gt;`{"scan_image": 1.dcm},`  
&gt;  
&gt;`{"scan_image": 2.dcm}`  
&gt;  
&gt;`]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`}`  
&gt;  
&gt;`]`

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I am facing is that for some reason the file objects upon posting them to the server using an axios POST request are all null. I have been looking around so much for a solution to this but with no luck. Hope I find it here.
