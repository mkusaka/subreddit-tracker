I am looking for a way to document my go api with swagger or something similar.

I have already used it on other languages but i can't find a decent comprehesive guide for golang.

Any of you guys could drop a tested package that you have worked with that has good documentation?

Note: i have found [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) or [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) but i find the docs to be confusing compared to other languages so it might be just me here! :)

Hi

  
I have a script that queries a web server (via REST). 

the script runs with its own schedule using crontab and i was wondering how can handle the authentication part of the script. the only thing i can think about is using some sort of config file that the script will read from to get the user\\password parameters but i don't want to have the password written in clear text (i can use base64 but it's not really secure either).

Do you have any ideas how can i securely store the password in a file?
