**1)** Why Javascript is your favorite language ?

**2)** Do you plan in going in another programming speciality / language in the future ? (e.g. C++ 3d graphics, legacy Java, database, something else etc)

**3)** Do you think that Javascrip is more cutting edge than C# or Java or is cannibalizing most of the business programming done by C#, Java etc since 1 language can do backend and frontend now and growing in popularity with frameworks like React / Electron etc ?

Which IDE is better? Visual Studio or Webstorm. I have been using VS for almost over a year now, and it seems pretty comfortable to work on. But I came across a post few days ago, where people are of the opinion that WebStorm is even better than VS when it comes to web development.

Now I have used Pycharm for python development, so I know how extremely good IntelliJ editors can be. But I dont want to install something and be disappointed later. So I would like to gather opinions
