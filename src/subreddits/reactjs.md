We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi all,

at Signofactory we love to travel üåé. The frustration of not being able to hop on the next plane pushed us to buy the domain [https://flights.rip](https://flights.rip)

We were unsure what to do with it so we eventually settled on a (very basic) flight search engine, trying to recreate the experience of popular website such as Skyscanner or Momondo using modern web technologies. We ended up using the very limited Skyscanner APIs ([provided through RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search)) to power the flight search, as they were the only free alternative we were able to find (suggestions appreciated!).

Some key features of the project:

* The frontend experience is built with Next.js (React) and the backend is built using Express.js (plus Passport for authentication)
* We experimented using Recoil, which I have to say is very straightforward although it lacks the opportunity to initialize values from server (we ended-up double wrapping our Component in \_app.js to initialize them via useEffect() hook). If you know of a better way to do so, we are here to chat with the community ;)
* Deployment is fully automated through Github actions to our webserver. If you are looking to deploy something like that on your own server look at the workflow files, there are some secrets you should configure (feel free to DM us if you need help with that)

We were deeply inspired from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gnn5j1/built_a_dribbble_clone_for_developers_mvp/) from the fellow Redditor u/abdulmdiaz

What do you guys think? Are you interested in seeing more content like this? Based on the feedback we get, we are thinking of releasing many more of these small "experiments" to keep on growing and building credibility for our clients.

We are also thinking about a small YT series like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gpovx1/nextjs_building_a_car_trader_app_all_6_videos_now/) to teach how to re-build our skyscanner clone (or another platform) from scratch. If you're interested, you can subscribe to our (upcoming) [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYDpGClrHtSbKD3qWHLovQ).

We are a small web development company based in Italy. Our [main website](https://signofactory.it) is currently under revamp, but we should be back online soon. We have worked in stealth mode on some cool stuff in the past - and we are now looking forward to sharing it with you guys!

Any comment or feedback is appreciated (even harsh ones) - we know we have a lot to learn!

## [10][Help with TypeScript type signature for "onClick" handler of button element](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gsrtnx/help_with_typescript_type_signature_for_onclick/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gsrtnx/help_with_typescript_type_signature_for_onclick/

Hi there,

I am new to front-end development and to React with TypeScript. I was wondering why I can write

    &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; console.log("BOOM!")}&gt;

without any compiler error, although Visual Studio Code tooltip tells me:

     (JSX attribute) React.DOMAttributes&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;.onClick?: ((event: React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent&gt;) =&gt; void) | undefined 

As far as I understand it, the `event` parameter is not optional. So why does the compiler not complain about `() =&gt; ...` although it should be `(event) =&gt; ...` ?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help,

Schorsch

## [12][How do you even use ant design's ConfigProvider?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gsr5rb/how_do_you_even_use_ant_designs_configprovider/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gsr5rb/how_do_you_even_use_ant_designs_configprovider/
---
In Ant Design's docs, under Usage, it simply writes:

    &lt;ConfigProvider {...yourConfig}&gt; &lt;App /&gt; &lt;/ConfigProvider&gt;

My impression of this was simply to wrap ConfigProvider around my ant design components and the components would somehow be able to consume my configurations, but it doesn't:

    import locale from 'antd/es/date-picker/locale/zh_CN';
    &lt;ConfigProvider locale={locale}&gt;
        &lt;DatePicker /&gt; // DatePicker should be accepting locale, but it isn't
    &lt;/ConfigProvider&gt;

Also, React's docs on Context mention that I'm supposed to have access to the Context if I want to have a component consume it, but I don't have access to it in this case.

Of course, I could simply directly pass the locale as props to DatePicker, but I don't want to do that. Any idea how to make my child components consume the locale prop? I've completely stumped.
