Hello all,

I'd post this only in a jobs channel, but since Kotlin is so nichey, I thought it'd be fine to post this here being the opening is fully remote.  
I'm looking for a fully remote Java developer with exposure or experience in Kotlin. This person really needs at least  years' of experience and it's nice if they've built out platforms in the past, rather than just maintenance. It'll need to be mostly during typical work hours as it'll be with a team of others. Paying $65-$70/hr for 40 hours per week.

Just starting to learn Kotlin, coming from dynamically typed and interpreted languages (js and ruby mostly).  I'm going through the Big Nerd Ranch Kotlin book and have a question about importing and useing classes.  I created a Player.kt file and have the player class in that file.  In a separate Game.kt file, I instantiate and use a player of player class without having to tell the file where it comes from in Player.kt. 

Can someone explain to me how this works?  Does it just get found at compile time?  If so, does that mean you don't have to import anything that is your project source code? 

Sorry for the ignorance of Kotlin and compiled languages in general.  Just trying to understand what is going on under the covers.

I tried Java in the past and it didn't fit my personal style - most frameworks were 'heavy' in the sense of many abstractions and learning curve. When I compare Spring with the Node/Python frameworks, the later are much more lightwight and simple (and less robust). That's my personal preference, I'm sure others like the Java-style which is great.  


Does Kotlin has the same 'DNA' like Java? can you recommend Kotlin backend framework which looks more similar to Express/Django and less Spring?  


p.s. By no mean I'm looking to discuss the right architecture/style, just checking if Kotlin is a candidate for my next project

Hi I'm a programmer and wish to create mobile apps. I've heard of Kotlin a while back and when thinking of which language to use, Kotlin is a probably the one I'll choose but I have questions before I make that choice

-How steep is the learning curve? I don't have Java or any C languages yet under my belt

-Can I create GUIs with Kotlin itself?

-Can I link my apps to Flutter for the interface?

Thanks in advance

We are currently using Lombok to reduce boilerplate, but we would rather use Kotlin's data classes. Null-safety, extension methods, and other idioms are just bonus. We don't have time to completely migrate the project to Kotlin anytime soon, so it would be a mixed project for a long time. What are your thoughts on mixing Kotlin with an existing Java legacy project?

Hi,

I'm fairly new to Kotlin and I want to know if I can 'streamline' this piece of code:

    private var selectedItems: MutableList&lt;String&gt; = mutableListOf&lt;String&gt;()
    
    
    fun select(dataList: ArrayList&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;, id: String){
    
            for (row in dataList){
                if (row["id"] == id){
                    selectedItems.add(row["name"].toString())
                }
            }
        }

The 'dataList' looks like this \[(name="abc", id="1"), (name="def", id="2"), ... \].

It's probably good to know that the id's are unique (might speed up the search). 

Sorry if there is a specific Kotlin learning subreddit (like /r/LearnPython) for these type of questions. I couldn't find it.

Thanks.
