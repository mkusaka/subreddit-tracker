We’re on the engineering team for Android Jetpack &amp; Jetpack Compose, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, August 27**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), focusing on a new topic every week. We’re excited to close out our [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid) with a focus on UI, and on Thursday we’ll be hosting an AMA on the Android Jetpack and Jetpack Compose!

[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is our suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We launched several new libraries like Hilt for Dependency Injection, App Startup, and updates to Paging, Navigation, CameraX, and more.  Check out the Jetpack updates we made during #11WeeksOfAndroid [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-jetpack.html).

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI - declarative, composable, and more! We just [launched](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/announcing-jetpack-compose-alpha.html) alpha, together with a bunch of new  training materials! Check out our new videos, or dive into our curated [pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose). We are excited to hear your feedback as you try it!

For this AMA, we want to answer your *technical* questions about Android Jetpack and Compose.  No roadmaps :)

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, August 27 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PDT / 4:20 PM EDT.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

## [3][Google reviewers telling us that the ad content in our app is not consistent with the app's content rating. Ignoring that we have a Neutral Age Screen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ij7nht/google_reviewers_telling_us_that_the_ad_content/)

Hi guys,

Google constantly rejecting our updates because of  the policy violation (ads are not suitable for children). But after reading through all of the Google Play policies many times we can't find any violations in our game.

&amp;#x200B;

Our game (50M installs) is rated 7+ and our audience includes both under and over 13 years old age groups.

&amp;#x200B;

This part is from Google Play Policy:

"If your app's target age groups include both children and older audiences, any ads that may be shown to children must be in compliance with Google Play's Families Ads Program. A **neutral age screen** must be implemented so that any ads not suitable for children are only shown to older audiences."

&amp;#x200B;

And this is from one of the Google Play emails that we got after appeal:

"Ensure that your app complies with all Families Policy Requirements (for example, you can include a neutral age screen if it’s applicable)."

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is that we already implemented neutral age screen so children under 13 years old can see only suitable ads that are rated 3+.

We tested our ads and our age screen - everything meets the requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps someone else has come across a similar situation and can share ideas on how to solve this problem?

so I have an App on Play store with size 14mb, yesterday I released a new version where I optimized the size to 12mb, but now I have reviews telling me that it's taking a lot of time to download when they have a speed wifi connection,   
I tried it myself it's really slow compared to Facebook app 45mb for example.   
is this store issue or something a developer can do something about?

Hello guys, hope y'all are doing well.

So I left Android development in early 2019 due to some personal reasons and school and I want to get into developing apps again for the most part of my spare time especially during this period of lockdowns and all the bad stuff going on.

I started android development in 2018 and I worked on a project which was published on the Playstore during that time. Learned a lot while working on that project and some other side projects but I had to stop at some point due to some reasons stated above.

Yesterday, I started looking up on some new features available for developers only to discover that there have been lots and lots of changes since I left which is cool by the way.

So guys, what are the best ways to catch up now. I originally learned Java and did a bit of Kotlin back then but didn't take it too seriously. I guess I would have to focus on learning Kotlin for now right? I'm also seeing JetPack Compose on the AndroidDev YT channel, how is it going to be any different from the normal XML way of building UIs?

I will be glad to hear what you guys think. Thanks.

I have been using Linux (Arch Linux) as my main work machine. I have been happy with Linux and never bothered going back to windows (I still have windows in dual boot setup).

Last week I opened windows (it had been a year) by mistake and man those **Working on updates** are still there. I was free at that time so I decided to use it for a while and there was a new update to **1909**. So I just updated it. 

I had a question regarding the RAM usage of android emulator when running on dedicated GPU, you can find the question [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=258449). Since I was in windows, I decided to verify if the same thing happens in windows or not. 

So I installed Android Studio and created a new AVD similar to the AVD in my Linux. To my great surprise the emulator was using around **600MB** of RAM. I was shocked to see the result as my Linux AVD was using around **1800MB** of RAM. I tried different Android versions for the AVD and all resulted in RAM usage below **700MB**. In my opinion, I was expecting AVD to use less RAM in Linux. 

I don't know if this is due to some **WSL 2.0** thing that windows is doing or am I the lucky one. Anyway has something noticed similar behavior?

Like webflow or something? 

I mean something actually good, none of that react native bullshit like thunkable or adalo.
