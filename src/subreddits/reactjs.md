We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

ðŸ‘‹ Hey guys. I wrote an article explaining React through visual mental models. I think it's a great way to have an intuitive grasp of React. 

Iâ€™ve learned that the biggest difference between someone that has mastered a language, framework, or tool and someone who hasnâ€™t lies in the *mental models* they use. One person will have a clear and advanced one and the other will not.

HELP!!!

The sign in with Google was redirecting back to the sign-in page and the id token was being printed to the console

1.Need you to send the id\_token to /api/users/google/

2. id\_token is the parameter

3. The response should be jwt tokens and user data

&amp;#x200B;

sorry this is my code

&amp;#x200B;

onGoogleSignIn =async (googleUser) =&gt; {

const id\_token = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id\_token;



if (id\_token === true){

const response = 

await [axiosInstance.post](https://axiosInstance.post)(' /api/users/google/', {

email:this.state.email,

password: this.state.password,

});

 const responseDataÂ =Â response.googleUser;  
 axiosInstance.defaults.headers\['Authorization'\]Â =Â "JWTÂ "Â +Â id\_token;  
 localStorage.setItem('access\_token',Â responseData.access);  
 localStorage.setItem('refresh\_token',Â responseData.refresh);  
 return googleUser;

}

return alert("ID token not found")

}

I am writting an app and I am using reactjs, now I leveraged a lot of react context and empty components, there's no centralized state, the application code is amazingly clean; everything is so reactive and clean, it really feels like you are just building an UI.

But the thing is slow to render, it seems to work just fine once it has rendered a view, but heavy view changes (page to page) clog the main thread, it takes 1200ms to render the initial view, 500ms in production, and I am talking with all the shouldComponentUpdate and PureComponent optimizations; the render takes only one single pass, and only one single pass, yet it takes that much time.

Subsequent renders go fast, but the initial render for some reason is really slow; I can see all the clogging comes in the fiber reconciler of react-dom; heck I can see the interface itself choking, adding divs and spans in real time. It doesn't look to bad because stuff is happening; all the colored boxes appear first creating a skeleton view (with the right width and height to contain the text), then text appears in those boxes, then all the data pops in the inputs; then console gives a warning, render took 1200ms, 500ms in production.

Any idea how one can make a mockup generator with React? Something like this: [https://prnt.sc/s7dcwm](https://prnt.sc/s7dcwm)  


Is there any easy way to do this?
