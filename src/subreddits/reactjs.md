We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi Guys, 

I just came across Scrimba. I absolutely love the learning experience. It's not video, it's not text. It's guided IDE experience? I actually don't know how to describe it yet..

Any ideas on how to approach that in React?

I have a react based website. Sometimes, I get confused what should be categorized as unit test or integration test in case of UI. Eg. Let me give following scenarios and can someone tell me how you find out what should be part of integration test can what should be part of unit test?

1. Testing a react component which has some button and onClick of which we make a call to backend and get data. We wanted to assert on this data. This entire simulation of steps should be unit test or integration test? 
2. Testing a component which has a sub component which dispatches an event to the Parent component. What should it be?
3. Testing a component without doing an click or anything. Just let it render and check if buttons are present, etc.?
4. Testing the scenarios which spans through multiple react components? Eg. User logins and then user clicks on some link and submits a form.

Please advise that how to differentiate between unit test and integration tests in above scenarios and in general.
## [10][best practices for a heartbeat refresh](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/erbwyq/best_practices_for_a_heartbeat_refresh/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/erbwyq/best_practices_for_a_heartbeat_refresh/

Hey all,

I want my client to have an option for a regular heartbeat that contacts my server and refreshes the information on the page. Googling has some information about how to do this, but the main articles I find seem unsure if this is even a good approach.

I can use the guides out there, or figure out my own solution, but I was wondering if there are best practices for this kind of thing with react. What's the best approach?

I have watched this video [Sharing Code Between React and React-Native: What Not to Share - Ben Ellerby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO7SkFqRd7s) and out of curiosity I want to know how well the website/apps are made (since I used to be a PHP developer that does Magento, and that Magento's functions are very complex to be 'cloned' at all)

The website [https://www.made.com/](https://www.made.com/) is still using Magento and the app is still IOS, I am not sure whether it's because I am not the target country they made the website for, tried with VPN in US/Germany too. (Anyone can check for me?)

The Case Study [https://www.theodo.co.uk/our-clients/made-omnichannel-react-migration](https://www.theodo.co.uk/our-clients/made-omnichannel-react-migration) actually says they delivered the mobile, web and kiosk applications already.

Well, checking out Ben Ellerby linkedin, he has been promoted to VP of Engineering from Architect Developer, so I could be wrong about the website?
