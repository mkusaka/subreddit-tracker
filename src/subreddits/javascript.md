Hi /r/javascript!

We are 3 researchers from the [Institute of Software Technology](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/se) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and currently conduct a  survey  to analyze the influence of technology trends and hypes on  software  development practices and the hiring process. Our target group  are  software and IT professionals both in technical as well as in  hiring roles. We think a lot of you will have an opinion on this topic, having undoubtedly tried to make sense of the JS framework jungle out there. The survey should not take more than 5 minutes.

Your participation would be a great help! Feel free to distribute to your colleagues as well.

[https://www03.surveygrid.com/public/online/index?AZ4A%2F11111](https://www03.surveygrid.com/public/online/index?AZ4A%2F11111)

If you have any questions, we'll also happily answer them here.

Thank you and stay healthy!

I'm curious about what the workflow was like, what kind of tooling was around and what kind of quirky JS behavior was there at the time, like `console` being `undefined` on old versions of IE. What's a good place to read more about this topic?

How efficiently can you synchronously busy loop with 100ms or less time between condition tests? Nodejs or browser.

    // probably runs hot, not a winning strategy :)
    while (true) { /* condition == true, do nothing, just burn cpu */ }
    // may run a bit warm
    while (isConditionMet()) { cp.execSync(`sleep 0.09`)) }
    // ice-cold?
    while (isConditionMet()) { /* your ideas here */ }

\&gt; "Uh, dude, JS is single threaded--your condition can't update? This is obviously a bad idea."

Not entirely true. But even so, assume it is.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the lowest energy way to run this loop? Not sure how we can assess the winner yet. Let's figure it out!
