In my opinion, there are cases where using the goto statement results in cleaner code.

Hello everyone! I'm trying to learn go, and to do so I've created a little quiz game to study psychopathology for an exam. My problem is that I don't like the code I've wrote, so I'm trying to do better, hoping to learn good go practices along the way. 

My question is: if I have a nested struct, with maps and stuff like this...:

```go
type Disorders struct {
    Disorders []Disorder
}

type Disorder struct {
    Name     string
    Symptoms Symptom
    // More stuff
}

type Symptom struct {
    Cognitive map[string]string
    Emotional map[string]string
    // More stuff
}
```

...what is the cleanest way to write a ```.String()``` method for everyone of them, that lets me specify the kind of symptom, the key of the map, etc.

I load the values from a JSON, so it looks like I can't use the [stringer tool](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer)

Do you see a better solution to writing every ```.String()``` method manually? 

Btw I wanted to thank this community, you're all very inclusive and supportive, and it's one of the subs I read from most gladly!
