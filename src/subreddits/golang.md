I couldn't decide. GoLang is new and heard its fast since its compiled. On the other hand, Python is very popular and is in demand right now. Google Trends show 90% for python and 5% for GoLang. I know python is a general purpose programming language, while GoLang is suited for system programming. Pls help me decide which one should I learn. I am a Javascript full stack developer and would like to strengthen my resume...

Hey Gophers!

A few months back I had a need for a commandline spinner, to provide some useful feedback for a tool I was writing. I tried to use the most popular spinner that we have in our ecosystem and I ran in to a few challenges. I initially thought about enhancing that package, but it would have required substantial breaking changes.

That ultimately took me down the path of writing my own, to experiment with a new API and implementation. I haven't had many ideas on what to add in the past few months, and am happy with the result so far, so I thought it might be good to share with you:

- https://github.com/theckman/yacspin

There are a few major differences from the other spinners we have in our ecosystem:

* It's safe for concurrent use (updating content while spinner is running)
* The ability to update the text in the spinner isn't tied to the animation
  * This means you don't need to trade animation aesthetics to have live-updating info
* Success and Failure results, that can use different final characters and message colors
* The spinner dynamically indents any text you specify to the maximum animation size
  * That way any text in your spinner doesn't shift back and forth as the spinner animates
* The ability to pause the animation so you can update a few properties at once, and make them appear atomic to the user

I've detailed quite a few of these in the `README.md` file, and even have gifs that compare the behaviors to other spinners if you're interested.

This seems to work as expected on Mac, Linux, and Windows. If you run in to any issues, or have any ideas for additions or changes, [please raise an issue](https://github.com/theckman/yacspin/issues/new)! Likewise, happy to review and accept contributions you raise.

I hope some of you find this useful, and are staying safe out there.

Cheers!
