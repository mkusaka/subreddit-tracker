**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

[This month's issue of Overload magazine (#156)](https://accu.org/var/uploads/journals/Overload156.pdf) had not one but two thought-provoking articles:
1. Profiting from the Folly of Others: a look at accessing private members of C++ classes by investigating a header called UninitializedMemoryHacks.h (from Facebook's Folly)
2. Deconstructing Inheritance: a critical look at implementation inheritance from the angle of LSP.

## [10][Current iostream status in C++?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g187t6/current_iostream_status_in_c/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g187t6/current_iostream_status_in_c/

**TL;DR**:

What is the status of the current iostreams in C++, in particular:

* are they discouraged from being used?
* what are the alternatives?
* is there an ongoing work in the committee to replace/fix them?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been actively working with standard stream just for a couple of days, so excuse me if I am missing something, but here is a list of questions I have got:

* Where is `fsync()` in std::? Or, in a more general wording, what are the guarantees the standard provides that a file/stream will actually write my data to disk? You **do** need to call this function [if you want to write a file to disk](https://lwn.net/Articles/457667/) (not just pretend).
* 2^(3) combinations of various state flags ([iostate](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/ios_base/iostate)) give rise to a whole host of checking functions: `good()`, `eof()`, `fail()`, `bad()`, `operator!()`, `operator bool()`. Is not it too much? Suppose your are using a stream, would you know without documentation which one and when to use?
* Why are the names of methods so cryptic: `btowc`, `sbumpc`, `xalloc`, `showmanyc`, `epptr`, `sungetc`?
* Are they ZeroCopy streams?
   * Why `stringstream::str()` cannot return (or set) an underlying string/buffer by rvalue? It requires copying.
   * Imagine a have a stream (let's consider two cases: based on a file or on a string) and I want to write a function that calculates md5 sum. How can I write it in such a way that it do not require **any** copying in case the stream is based on a string (that is a legitimate requirement, since C++ has always had [this tenet](http://www.stroustrup.com/ETAPS-corrected-draft.pdf): "*What you donâ€™t use, you donâ€™t pay for \[BS94\]. And further: What you do use, you couldnâ€™t hand code any better*")? As far as I understand, any stream implementation has an internal continuous buffer. In the case of string, this buffer could be the string itself, in case of file it could be either chunk of the file, or even entire `mmap()`'ed file. How do I get access directly to the buffer in the current C++ streams?
* All operations by one? The closest I managed to get to the buffer is [`streambuf`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_streambuf), but the problem is that all its public functions work only with one(!) character at a time: "reads one character from the input..." and so on...

Just in case you want to know how it can be implemented otherwise, have a look at Google's [ZeroCopyInputStream](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.io.zero_copy_stream#ZeroCopyInputStream).

**Finally, my question**:

Can please anyone rebut/debunk what I have pointed out above, or tell the status of the current iostreams:

* are they discouraged from being used?
* what are the alternatives?
* is there an ongoing work in the committee?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Just made a quick grep for "fsync" in the sources of postgres and got nearly [80(!) occurrences](https://gist.github.com/DimanNe/3a3e520569af5ff09e15125538c706b7) - does it mean that it is even dangerous to use current streams?

I am thinking of taking this course:

Anyone had experience taking Dolous classes before?
