This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Basically I want to create an app for my use only that will go into a different app and press something at a certain time every day. Basically I have an app where I have to press a big button thats in the middle of the screen every morning, and I'd like to create an "app" on my phone to automate it and have it automatically press the button every morning for me without me having to do anything. Anyone has any idea how I can have an app open another app and press something while running in the background?

Hi. My city recently developped an android app which shows each bus live location. I would like to build a little script which could get the live location of the nearest bus every x minutes. However i've never coded anything with android and I dont know where to start (I dont even know if this extraction is possible, because I dont own the app so it might be a problem ?). Any suggestion ? Thanks

Why are devs at google making it hard for android developers? They release libraries so frequently and completely overhaul everything. It was fine till a limit. Now again they are releasing jetpack compose which is a completely new thing. I don't have problem learning new things but the rate at which they release new stuff is far swift than other frameworks. For example they release a new dependency injection hilt while recruiters still look for dagger 2. Android is just getting overwhelming. What are your thoughts?

So I have a spinner (drop-down select, the naming of this thing is another rant) and I have a blue background and want to change the text colour to white, sounds simple, right?

to do that I have to create TWO layout resources (one for selected item and one for dropdown) and in code declare an adapter which needs the item array (cause the reference in XML is not enough), context, and the resource for the style of the selected item. then on a separate line I have to declare a separate resource for the items in the drop-down menu.

I JUST WANTED TO CHANGE THE TEXT COLOUR!!!!! why do does this need two extra XML files and 3 lines of code!? it sometimes feels like a lot of the android API is specifically made to have as many files in a project as possible

Hallo fellow redditors!

&amp;#x200B;

I hoped that maybe you could help me. :)

A friend and I are developing an App which was originally planned as an Alexa Skill. Our program works 'offline' so to speak, but trying to code with AWS (Amazon Web Services) was a big pain in the ass. No other way to put it.

So now we have to build/integrate the **google assistant** (or any smart speaker tool for that matter) into our program. From scratch. \*sigh\*

It's supposed to work like this:

1. You trigger the program with a keyword.
2. You say a command.
3. Program responds with google assistant.
4. that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any experience in this? I am not asking for code, but if you have any advice whatsoever or if you'd share your experience,  I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you very much in advance! :)

I come from iOS dev and android fragmentation gives me a bit of headache.

I have app that target specific android devices, which at this moment are android 4.4-8 (19-26 sdk)

I know that i have to set compilesdk &gt;=18 to support androidx. If I change this and migrate to androidX, will I be able to still support these older android versions?

Hi all,

I wanted to share with everyone an open-source library that helps you turn a raw Android Bitmap, Canvas, or image resource drawable (or anything you can draw on a hardware-accelerated Canvas) into a video. Also allows for audio muxing!

It is a pure, simple Android MediaCodec implementation. Requires no third party libs or NDK. Currently supports the MP4 container and both AVC/H264 and HEVC/H265. Easily extensible to other supported formats.

I recently finished rewriting everything in Kotlin. This came about because I wanted to have a feature similar to what Google Photos does, but didn't want a server do the processing for me. 

To my knowledge, there were no existing libraries for Android that allowed for on-device hardware-accelerated video multiplexing, so we decided to create one! It's not perfect yet, but we'll continue to work on improving it. 

Hopefully it helps someone else, happy coding!

Big shout out to [dburckh](https://github.com/dburckh) who helped write a lot of the multiplexing logic, which we borrowed heavily from [BigFlake's](https://bigflake.com/mediacodec/EncodeAndMuxTest.java.txt) implementation.

I used to be a network engineer and switched over to software development for Android. I always wanted to eventually make networking apps, like speed-test, monitoring, remote configuration, etc. What are some good open-source projects, apps, libraries, resources I can look into?
