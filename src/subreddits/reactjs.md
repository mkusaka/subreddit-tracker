I've been building my own projects in React for about 6 months. I feel like I've been doing well and constantly learning but at the same time I still sense something might be missing. I started learning React  from one course in Scrimba and took it from there - just googling stuff. There's certainly more things out there than the way I learned things.

&amp;#x200B;

Did you, after a while builing apps with React, watched a course or video that changed the way you think about React?

I have done some React courses and gone through to-do apps etc and I'm now looking for a meatier project to learn from!

As per the title, if there is a project which matches that it would great. So far I've found Spectrum on github but it's a bit too big for me to dive into. I also found this: [https://github.com/oldboyxx](https://github.com/oldboyxx) which I've learned from, but it doesn't have Redux-Toolkit (or any redux actually).

Thanks for any pointers!

I'll explain.

I have a comment section for my React blog that pulls comments from JSON.

A typical comment looks like this:

    {
            "path": "https://www.website.com/blog-post/", 
                "comment": "I have no reply, only a question and I am  undoubtedly presuming...", 
                "parent_id": 314541, 
                "name": "Thomas", 
                "date": "2018-05-12", 
                "id": 406163, 
                "avatar": "https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/4e234b1110fa5123dbe9c4e73e77d69?s=48&amp;r=x&amp;d=robohash"
              }

As you can see, there's a unique \`id\` for the comment, and an optional \`parent\_id\` when it's a reply to a parent comment (took the idea from Wordpress).

The relevant comment section in JSX is here:

    
    return data.allCommentsJson.edges.map(d =&gt; {
        const val = Object.values(d)[0]
        const HasComment = val.path === OgUrl
        const comment = val.comment.replace(/\n/g, "&lt;br /&gt;")
        const hasParent = val.parent_id &gt; 0
        return (
          &lt;&gt;
            {HasComment ? (
              &lt;li key={val.id} style={{marginLeft: hasParent? `10%` : `0`}}&gt;
                &lt;CommentWrap&gt;
                  &lt;article
                    itemProp="comment"
                    itemScope
                    itemType="https://schema.org/Comment"&gt;
                    &lt;header&gt;
                      &lt;Robot
                        fixed={{
                          aspectRatio: 1 / 1,
                          src: `${val.avatar}`,
                          width: `42px`,
                          height: `42px`,
                        }}
                        alt={val.name}
                      /&gt;
                      &lt;h4
                        itemProp="author"
                        itemScope
                        itemType="https://schema.org/Person"&gt;
                        &lt;span itemProp="name"&gt;{val.name}&lt;/span&gt;
                      &lt;/h4&gt;
                      &lt;CommentMeta&gt;
                        &lt;time itemProp="datePublished"&gt;{val.date}&lt;/time&gt;
                      &lt;/CommentMeta&gt;
                    &lt;/header&gt;
                    &lt;CommentBody itemProp="text"&gt;
                      &lt;p dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: comment}}&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;ReplyButton href="#comments"&gt;Reply&lt;/ReplyButton&gt;
                    &lt;/CommentBody&gt;
                  &lt;/article&gt;
                &lt;/CommentWrap&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            ) : null}
          &lt;/&gt;
        )
      })
    }

My question is, when I map over \`data.allCommentsJson.edges.map\`, how can I sort this data to pair comments with parent comments (if it's a reply)?

So if a comment has a \`parent\_id\` that matches the \`id\` of another comment, then reorder the index to place the reply directly underneath the parent. 

Right now, comments are just displayed chronologically which means that replies are not where they should be.

Hi all,

I'm looking for a solid listbox component. A component which displays an always visible list of items (unlike a dropdown which hides the item list when it loses focus), which can be single- or multi-selectable. 

Something similar to a pivot table slicer, in which one can select multiple items by simply clicking and dragging the mouse.

Something similar to the last component on the following codepen, but with a cleaner UI.
 https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-l6suj

Anyone came across something similar?

I need your help that am I  doing right or i'm missing something? please check the code and  let me know.

code :-

scrollbar.jsx

 &lt;div className="scrollable-content"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;    
 &lt;/div&gt;    
  );    
};    
Scrollable.defaultProps = {    
 children: null,

**De-note** is a minimal note taking app built with react and bootstrap. I used create-react-app as a base structure.

I'm new to React and posting on Reddit and this is my first take at it while learning so it may  be a little crude in terms of coding standards.

Please review and guide me where I can improve also what is the future safe learning path for react and related stuff?
