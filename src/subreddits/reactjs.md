We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [4][A functional component with state is oxymoronic and no different from an object](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f6pkce/a_functional_component_with_state_is_oxymoronic/)

Something with an internal state is an object.

Something which is functional has no internal state.

Therefore a component cannot both be functional and still have an internal state.

It may look like a function, it may be labelled as a a functional component, it may use something called "hooks", but conceptually, it has an internal state, and that makes it an object.

Why does React call it a functional component when it behaves like an object?

A few days ago MongoDB anounced that they added GraphQL out of the box in MongoDB, because I think it has a lot to do with how we maybe build React apps in the future I wanted to ask here what you all think about it.
For me it is amzing when I think about it I have my Client Side CRA connected direct to MongoDB's GraphQL service, this removes the need of having a server between writing middlewares and maintaing it, I personally like the idea and will try it tommorow how about everyone else do you think a new trend is coming where this hosted cloud database providers give you direct out of the box api for your database?

Been playing around with hooks recently. Lots to like, once you get past some of the unusual function call order restriction.

But one major question pops up with useEffect. Unless I'm missing something, the primary example does not cover a specific edge case, see here:

https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#example-using-hooks-1

Assume that like most subscriptions, `ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus` doesn't fire retroactively. That is, it will only fire for *future* event changes. If that's the case, isOnline will remain null until a friend comes online. That doesn't seem like the best UX. Contrived example: a workplace where a user might come online at 9 am and stay online all day.

In this hypothetical scenario, another user that logs in at 9:05 am would see their friend as "null" or "loading" for the full day.

So, what's the idiomatic React way of fixing it? I can't find it explicitly documented anywhere. The two closest options I see are:

1. Replace the initial state. Instead of null, pass in something like `ChatAPI.getFriendStatus(props.friend.id)`
2. If the above is expensive, replace it with a lazy function as documented here: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state and inside that function, call `ChatAPI.getFriendStatus(props.friend.id)`

**Is there something far more obvious I'm missing?**

My immediate move, and definitely what *not* to do, is adding a manual call to handleStatusChange() with the imaginary `ChatAPI.getFriendStatus(props.friend.id)` as an argument. Doing this inside the effect, to populate the first status, causes a loop between state updating and the effect triggering, unless you use the useEffect optimization.

Hope this makes sense! Have others faced this issue?

AdminBro is an automated admin interface for Node.js apps based on React, written in TypeScript = Django admin for node on steroids !!!

Now, we almost finish the entire scope for v2.0 and we released it along with the demo version: 

Demo page can be found here:

[https://admin-bro-example-app-staging.herokuapp.com/admin](https://admin-bro-example-app-staging.herokuapp.com/admin)

Github repo is here: [https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro)

and you can install it using: 

```
yarn add admin-bro@2.0.0-beta.26
```

In this version: 

* there is an entire Design System written specially for AdminBro
* i18n support
* hooks support
* the entire UI change to Drawer'like exploring resources

Now we are working on the documentation which (WiP) can be fond here:

[https://softwarebrothers.github.io/admin-bro-dev/v2/](https://softwarebrothers.github.io/admin-bro-dev/v2/)

Let me know what do you think - and star the repo if you like the idea :)

Hi, I'm new to react development, please help me with notifications functionality, let's say a user is doing his/her work on the page, and got message from a friend, this message is received by a backend service (spring-boot), now how can I send this notification (event) to the user. When I look for event listeners, most of the answers talk about button or some sort of internal action event listeners, how do I make the app listen for external notifications, like something sent by backend services. Thanks.
