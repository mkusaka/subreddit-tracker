Happy to have made **my first Npm module** ðŸŽ‰, I would like to share it with you.

I present to you **Fitext**.

This module adapts the text elements so that they are always contained in their parents without ever exceeding whatever the height and width of the parents, even if the amount of text varies.

**I'm interested by any return or advices on it**, have a nice days devs ðŸ˜ƒ !
