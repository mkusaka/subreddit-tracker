Hey, does someone know a good game library for Kotlin (for JVM, native, script/js or wasm)?

Suppose I wanted to know what properties are available on the Kotlin object introduced by the Kotlin JVM Gradle plugin. From the [Using Gradle reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) I can see that kotlin.incremental is a valid property, but is there a real reference of all properties and methods of the kotlin JVM plugin (preferably w/o having to use reflection to find them)?

The layout of the STD LIB docs is so shitty it hurts.  There are no collapsable sections once you enter into a package.  Why can't it be laid out like the JavaDocs? Trying to find something on the page requires you to scroll half a mile to find the sub-heading you're even looking for.  Entire sections should be collapsable at least on the subheading

I don't know how I bungled it up so badly this morning, but I've managed to get it working.  I suspect I didn't actually select Kotlin and I selected Java with Kotlin as an additional framework... and man I don't know I must have just needed coffee or something.  Thanks for chiming in, I'm finally in business now!

~~So I'm trying to make  anew Kotlin project but there's a problem, I can't even produce a Hello World.  Using intellij 2020.2.3 there appears to be two ways to create a Kotlin project (Either selecting Kotlin directly, or choosing Java and selecting Kotlin/JVM as an additional framework), and neither of them work out of the box, and all of the documentation I can find is seemingly out of date (~~[~~https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/jvm-get-started.html~~](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/jvm-get-started.html) ~~for example, the UI options it walks you through don't exist),~~

~~Once you successfully create a project, it fails to setup because the configuration doesn't work.  I had to update some gradle options to get the correct version of gradle for my version of the JVM. Thankfully I was able to find that solution on Stack Overflow because I would have never figured that out on my own or with the available documentation.  So it downloads the new gradle version, and the example main function created by the IDE has no green Run button in the gutter, and attempting to build the project yielded some 2000 lines of LLVM optimization errors.~~

~~Is there a better "hello world" walkthrough somewhere on the internet?  I'm not really finding a lot of help with all of this, and frankly this is kind of a nightmare compared to pretty much every other environment I've ever worked with.~~

I'd like to create a web and mobile app that uses an interactive [choropleth map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map).  Since the release of Kotlin Multiplatform, I was thinking about trying to use [https://leafletjs.com/](https://leafletjs.com/), but I'm not sure how well it will work.  Any advice is much appreciated!
