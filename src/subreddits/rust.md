Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i6yqng/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

## [10][Can I learn this instead of C++ and still be worth my salt or do I need to learn C++?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ig6g1c/can_i_learn_this_instead_of_c_and_still_be_worth/)

So I know C++ at its core, but the languages huge list of features is insane and hard to learn. Can I learn rust and be worth as much as a C++ developer in the commercial market or will Rust always be that one language that business just doesn't use? That's a hard question to answer I totally realize that. I know Rust doesn't support popular C++ libs like Qt etc but I recognize that it's still early.

Also, how does Rust differ from C++ in terms of OOP? Glossing over Rust reveals a more functional-ish language given the terms structs, procedures and module buzzwords being thrown about in the docs.

PS: I'm fluent in Swift and a little Kotlin mainly. If this post violates the rules, feel free to remove.. I guess I'm just looking for perspectives.
