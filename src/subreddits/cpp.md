**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

Hello Der,

I'm trying to make a ECS in c++ and started exploring the existing material a little, going down the rabbit hole I ended up finding out about special allocators.

I think I get the theory behind the allocators, and have seen multiple (around 5) videos from cpp con and one from code::dive 2018 about allocators, and I do get that using allocators&lt;typename&gt; is bad and that you should use                   std::pmr::datatype&lt;typename, &amp;(allocator)&gt;           instead.

What I specifically don't understand is what function other than :  new, malloc, realloc, calloc (these are general allocators right?). do you use to get the memory in the first place? Like what is that one function that gives you a block of memory on the ram to work with so that nothing else touches it? What does the actual grabbing memory out of thin air work?

Do you like just get an array of some required size in bytes, and then deal with that ? Or is there a function that you can call so you don't have to create an array? This seems kind of contradictory?

I apologize if I make absolutely no sense, but can someone please help me out... I don't think I'm intelligent enough to figure this out on my own...

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: yes things make more sense after asking the question.

Allocators aren't the ones that actually allocate the memory aren't they? They just hand out pointers to the allocated memory in such a way that everything works for the expected specific purpose?

So is it alright to use new? and std::allocator&lt;t&gt;::allocate(n) to get the memory block and then have an allocator class that deals with it?

Hello! I want to share with you my first open source app. I want to learn so feel free to point any suggestions or improvements you consider!

[https://github.com/AlexSL92/udp-packet-replicator](https://github.com/AlexSL92/udp-packet-replicator)

It is a command line application that sends a packet stored in binary format through the network using UDP protocol. 

I have been using it to test local network applications. You can store a packet with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for example and then replicate it constantly to the desired IP and port.

I hope you find it interesting! Feel free to post any suggestion about the code or the functionality.

Hi guys,

When implementing a grid class I stumbled upon a problem in my deduction guides.

My grid class consists a number of indexable objects (like `std::vector` or `std::array` or a linspace implementation like in matlab) which describe the positions of the grid per dimension. Now the grid class's task is to create positions from these indexable objects by combining these. This works in my impementation without any issues. When passing the dimension descriptions directly via a parameter pack there is also no problem.

The actual problems comes when a constructor is called that does not take a variadic parameter pack where you have the types directly but with a constructor that only gets said how many dimensions it has to get via a number as template parameter N, but not which types. We only have some bounding box and a resolution and want to repeat `linspace` N-times.

Now with C++17 we got deduction guides. One could repeat linspace with a `std::index_sequence&lt;Is...&gt;` (`sizeof...(Is) == N`) in the deduction guide like this:  
`decltype((Is, linspace{})...)`

And the whole deduction guide looks like this:  
`template &lt;std::size_t N, std::size_t... Is&gt;`  
`grid(bb&lt;N&gt;, vec&lt;N&gt;, std::index_sequence&lt;Is...&gt;)`  
  `-&gt; grid&lt;decltype((Is, linspace{})...)&gt;`

But this only works if you already have a  `std::index_sequence`  
It would be great if you could call one deduction guide from another or when a constructor C1 calls another constructor C2 the deduction guide of C2 would be called if C1 is used. 

Here is a little framework: [https://godbolt.org/z/QNc-4x](https://godbolt.org/z/QNc-4x)  
In line 38/39 is the constructor where linspace would magically need to be repeated.  
Its deduction guide in 54/55 is not able to do this.

The constructor with `std::index_sequence` in line 32/33 can with help of its deduction guide in lines 47/48.

Maybe there is some super simple solution I have overseen. Or maybe there is no solution to this problem. Suggestions are welcome!

Best Regards
