## [2][Who's Available? [Jan 2020]](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eouupz/whos_available_jan_2020/)

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Im currently in the process of searching for seo friendly technologies to use in a money transfer website like:

https://www.monisnap.com

And i came across gatsby because i want to use react since im familiar with it.

Is it a good choice to use on this kind of website or should i use it for the landing page only.

Thanks
## [7][Introducing MockRequests, the first network-mocking library that's actually user-friendly!](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/epiv1c/introducing_mockrequests_the_first_networkmocking/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/epiv1c/introducing_mockrequests_the_first_networkmocking/
---
Unlike most other front-end network-mocking libraries, this small but powerful library provides a simple, user-friendly method for configuring mock responses for any URL. A quick rundown of the features this provides:

* No changing source code! With this library, you don't need to replace either the URL called (e.g. replacing `https://real.url/api` with `localhost/mockApi`) or the fetch call (e.g. `fetch(url)` with `Promise.resolve(mock)`).
* No painful configuration of complex node servers, proxies, or anything else! Simply install and go.
* Full support for use along with third-party libraries, such as `Axios` and `jest`.
* Dynamic response modifications to mimic back-end alterations of data.
* Query parameter parsing to mock all URLs with the same pathname with the same dynamic response function.
* Mock response resolution times for different URLs individually.
* Easily split mock code from production code and/or activate mocks via terminal (e.g. `MOCK=true npm start`).
* Configure all URLs you desire to mock within one single `MockRequests.configure()` function call.
* Mix mock responses with real API calls by only configuring the URLs you need mocked.

Feel free to check out the in-depth ReadMe and install at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-requests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-requests), or check out the React demo at [https://d-pow.github.io/MockRequests/demo/](https://d-pow.github.io/MockRequests/demo/).

## [12][Do we have any doc or tutorial that I can deploy Nextjs on github.io?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/epiito/do_we_have_any_doc_or_tutorial_that_i_can_deploy/)

I don't really know about the Reactjs router. But I used Nextjs before. Thus, I am thinking to deploy a GitHub blog using reactjs and nextjs on [github.io](https://github.io). Do anyone know how to do it?
