Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i6yqng/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hi! RsMixer is a pulsaudio volume mixer with a terminal user interface and vi-like keybindings. It is configurable (both keybindings and colors).

This is my first big project written in rust, so any constructive criticism of the code is welcome.

        let doors: Vec&lt;_&gt; = [
            Door::new(),
            Door::new(),
            Door::new(),
        ]
        .into_iter()
        .map(|v| {
            Rc::new(RefCell::new(v)) as Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;dyn IDoor&gt;&gt;
        })
        .collect();

I want to create multiple instances of Door and wrap each of them into Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;&gt;&gt;. Resulting collection elements should have trait type IDoor instead of specific type.

What's the correct way of doing that?

&amp;#x200B;

The compiler error is: the trait \`IDoor\` is not implemented for \`&amp;Door\`
