Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j57z68/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

It takes care of the page layout and text alignment and renders a document tree into a PDF document.  All of its dependencies are written in Rust, so you donâ€™t need any pre-installed libraries or tools.

    let mut doc = genpdf::Document::new("./fonts", "Liberation")
        .expect("Failed to create PDF document");
    // Change the default settings

    // Render the document and write it to a file

There's one thing I hate more than anything else about Rust - more than confusing lifetime errors, more than compile times, even more than `std::ops::Range`: asking questions on StackOverflow.

55% of the my questions are edited, and 15% are *erroneously* closed as duplicates/too broad by one single user. I won't name them but anyone who has posted a Rust question to StackOverflow will know who I am talking about.

This user often posts useful information, but I did not ask him to be my personal copy editor. If a *single person nitpicked more than half* of all the text he wrote I do not think he would appreciate it. And we are talking nitpicks. Here is a typical edit:

&gt; Convert SystemTime date to ISO 8601 in rust

to

&gt; How do I convert a SystemTime to ISO 8601 in Rust?

The question closures are worse than the edits though. StackOverflow has a meme-level problem with overzealous question closure, and it's especially infuriating because closed questions are almost impossible to reopen (only 6% are). Out of the 4 closed-as-duplicates I have been punished by, I would say only 1 was a genuine duplicate. The others have helpful answers. To have so many questions mistakenly closed by a single prolific user is very frustrating.

The Rust team seem to be keen to make the Rust community welcoming. This is not welcoming. It also does not happen with any other topic I ask about - only Rust.

The thought of asking a question on StackOverflow should not fill me with dread. It should not make me think "god I hope that guy is asleep".

## [6][How does HashMap return a reference to a value?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jbmc1y/how_does_hashmap_return_a_reference_to_a_value/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jbmc1y/how_does_hashmap_return_a_reference_to_a_value/

Hello.

I was wondering how does HashMap return a reference to a value without getting

`returns a value referencing data owned by the current function`

&amp;#x200B;

        pub fn get&lt;BK&gt;(&amp;self, key: &amp;BK) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;V&gt;
        where
            BK: Hash + Eq + ?Sized,
            K: Borrow&lt;BK&gt;,
        {
            self.root
                .get(hash_key(&amp;*self.hasher, key), 0, key)
                .map(|&amp;(_, ref v)| v)
        }

&amp;#x200B;

I have a similar function `get` for a struct that owns a HashMap and I'm trying to return that value reference and I get a compilation error: `returns a value referencing data owned by the current function`

        fn get&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, key: &amp;'a dyn MyTrait) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'a dyn MyTrait&gt; {
            ...
            hm.get(&amp;key)
                .map(|v| v as &amp;dyn MyTrait)
        }

&amp;#x200B;

I think I understand the essence of the problem, where I'm a returning a reference to something that `hm` owns, but how does it work for HashMap?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I think I understand something that is missing from my question and is the reason for this issue.

        fn get&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, key: &amp;'a dyn MyTrait) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'a dyn MyTrait&gt; {
            let hm = self.hm.lock().unwrap();
            hm.get(&amp;key)
                .map(|v| v as &amp;dyn MyTrait)
        }

`hm` is actually a local variable that unlocks [self.hm](https://self.hm) (is behind a mutex)

I redacted this code my original question as I didn't understand this is the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get around that?

My guess is there's no way other than cloning the value as it's a reference to something behind a mutex. Problem is I cannot have MyTrait be Cloneable because then I get errors for not being about to have MyTrait as a trait object....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

I'm working on this for about two hours now.

I have a tokio application where I get a `Stream&lt;Item = Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;` (actually it is a bit more complex because shiplift (from master branch) returns an enum of buffers, but for the sake...) and I need to convert this to a `Stream&lt;Item = Result&lt;String&gt;&gt;` (parsing linewise into UTF8).

(the ultimate goal is to parse linewise using nom, but having a stream over lines is the first step towards this).

I am lost right now. This seems to be a task that is way too hard for me to implement. Maybe some of you gurus around here can help.

My code is https://gist.github.com/matthiasbeyer/6b5f3a79f75a68c2bdef5536bcd8f57d (I hope I included all relevant parts). Note that the code example actually handles the shiplift return value which is an enum over three different types of buffers.

## [12][Is there a clever way to deserialize this nightmarish json into either structs or vectors?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jb1bdm/is_there_a_clever_way_to_deserialize_this/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jb1bdm/is_there_a_clever_way_to_deserialize_this/
---
I'm hoping a Serde wizard can kindly help me as I've been stuck on this all day. I'm trying to deserialize json of a format I've not encountered before which I am struggling with, due to it being a weird mixture of stucts and arrays. These are the 5 overall different message types:

    {"event": "event_name", ...other fields} // other fields vary depending on event
    ["heartbeat", "id"]     //heartbeart
    ["channel_id",  "price",  "count",  "amount" ]     //trade
    ["channel_id", [  ["price",  "count",  "amount"], ["price",  "count",  "amount" ] , ... ] ]    //snapshot
    ["channel_id", [  ["order",  "level",  ], ["order", "level" ] , ... ] ] //other_snapshot

So far I have got something like this, where I am using untagged and tag

    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
    [serde(untagged)]
    enum WebSocketMessages { 
       Heartbeat(String, String), 
       Trade(String, String, String, String),
       Snapshot(String, Vec&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;),
       OtherSnapshot(String, Vec&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;)
       Events(Events), 
    }
    
    [derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
    [serde(tag = "event")]
    enum Events {
      //  I know I can put structs in here depending on event_names 
    }

I think the Events part will work with using the tag of event to put different structs in the Events enum. My big problem I think is with the two "snapshots", as the structure of both is very similar and yet I don't know how to neatly specify one has arrays of length 3 (price, count amount) and the other has arrays of length 2 (order, level). Also I'm mixing up String and Vec together in the enum which doesn't feel right.

If anyone can give me a tip or help I would really appreciate it.
