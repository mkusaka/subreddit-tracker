We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello, I've been going through the University of Helsinki Full stack course which teaches React and Node, I'm about half way through the course and starting to build my own stuff to reinforce the knowledge. I'm not sure however if the structure of the components is good, if my app is well designed and I would like to see how the pros do it. If you can help me by recommending some projects that are considered to have good code and adhere to best practices i would be grateful.

I'm in the process of making a simple Todo app. Currently I'm trying to implement a HOC *Private Route*, to protect some routes, in this case the todo routes displaying all todos.

However, eventough the App.js state `isAuth` changes between true and false, the HOC always redirects to the Login page.

Is there maybe something wrong with my lifecycle?

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
//Import BrowserRoute to enclose the components and Route for path declaration
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, Redirect } from "react-router-dom";

import Todo from "./components/Todo/Todo";
import Login from "./components/Login/Login";

export default function App() {
  const [isAuth, setIsAuth] = useState(false); // initially set to false. Only initialIsAuthenticated() or &lt;Login&gt; can set it to true

  // Ask the server if there is an existing session for the user
  function initialIsAuthenticated() {
    fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/users/is-authenticated/", {
      credentials: "include",
      headers: {
        Accept: "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
    }).then(res =&gt; {
      setAuthenticating(false);
      if (res.ok) {
        setIsAuth(true);
      }
    });
  }

  // Run the initialIsAuthenticated() on component mount
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    initialIsAuthenticated();
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
      &lt;div id="app"&gt;
        &lt;main&gt;
          &lt;Switch&gt;
            &lt;PrivateRoute exact path="/" component={Todo} isAuth={isAuth} /&gt;
            &lt;Route
              path="/login"
              render={props =&gt; &lt;Login {...props} setIsAuth={setIsAuth} /&gt;}
            /&gt;
          &lt;/Switch&gt;
        &lt;/main&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
  );
}

const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, isAuth }) =&gt; {
  // Here, no matter if isAuth is true or false, it always redirects to Login
  // I know this because replacing &lt;Redirect to="/login" /&gt; to null does not redirect.
  // I also tried switching  &lt;Redirect to="/login" /&gt; : &lt;Component {...props} /&gt; just to see the effect, and it still does a Redirect.
  return (
    &lt;Route
      render={props =&gt;
        isAuth ? &lt;Component {...props} /&gt; : &lt;Redirect to="/login" /&gt;
      }
    /&gt;
  );
};
```

## [7][Digital product store with React - how to distribute products?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gk8fi3/digital_product_store_with_react_how_to/)

I'm building a simple ecommerce site in React to put some downloadable products up for sale.

I want to keep things as simple and light as possible, so the plan is to host the site statically and avoid using/paying for a CMS.

For payments, I'm deciding between Stripe and Paypal (this decision isn't obvious because my country is an emerging market, so I have to jump through some hoops to set things up).

**Question 1:** Do I need a third party CMS to store, track sales of and distribute my digital products, or is Stripe/Paypal capable of doing this for me (even if they do a very simple job of it)? When I say distribute, I mean "email the customer a download link to the file", "show a download link on the page after checkout" or anything similar.

**Question 2:** If Stripe/Paypal can't distribute my digital products for me, should I use something like SendOwl or GumRoad? 

**Question 3:** What are my options for building this functionality myself? Is it enough to just setup a Lambda function which emails customers a link to the product they paid for? I'm not too attracted to this because I'd like to have at least some primitive sales/customer metrics.

Thanks!

Hi, I'm developing JavaScript arcade vertical shooter style game and I've been thinking about using react and canvas for it, but don't really know how to best use them together. Can you recommend me some tutorials about that? I've also been thinking about incorporating redux for game state management.

How would you use context to wrap you app.tsx and render if it is authenticated or not?

I'm having a token which I'm sending to authenficiation server and get a user token back if token is valid, and if not, I'm  redirecting the user to the authentification page.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I in App.tsx use context to define if the user exist or not?

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way of doing it?

Me and my cousin saw all the websites of the business around us and they are all wordpress templates taking 5 seconds to load , so we wanted to help them out and make some profit while doing it!

We just made our landing page and wanted to see how it was since we want to provide as much quality as we can.

also we plan to offer something like 5 free websites (excluding maintenance) for some business around us to get some testimonials , do you thing thats a good idea?

thanks for the feedback i really appreciate it
