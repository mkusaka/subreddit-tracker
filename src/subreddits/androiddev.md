* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hey there! As far as I know it's possible to run virtual devices, but only (?) x86 images. Is this a huge disadvantage in development?
I'm not an experienced programmer, but made some basic apps in the past. Now I'm thinking about to change from desktop to laptop, and i want something for long term which is capable for proper developing cause I want to refresh my knowledge.

## [8][Will Google issue a moratorium on automated bot-bans while rest of human world is in COVID-19 lockdown?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fjh1ri/will_google_issue_a_moratorium_on_automated/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fjh1ri/will_google_issue_a_moratorium_on_automated/

This relates to automated bot-bans and account perma-bans in a time of human distress.

We are now facing exactly the situation I mentioned earlier in my posts on how auto bot-bans can overwhelm a preoccupied dev - that a dev could be on hospital bed, while a series of app-bans are triggered by a Google bot, which leads to an account perma-ban, depriving a dev of livelihood exactly when he is most vulnerable.

That possibility may have been quaint to some at that time, but it is now a grave reality.

At this time the human side of Google Play (the devs) will be experiencing lockdown, medical expenses and general slowdown in the support networks around them.  Many will be caught up in support roles for their older parents and relatives and friends.

At this time the automated side of Google Play will be chugging along merrily at it's usual speed.  And maybe even faster if the management are psychopaths - bot-banning and account perma-banning will continue at speed.

At a time when there is a general understanding in governments that some relief is needed, **will Google step up to the plate and announce that they will be suspending the aggressive bot behavior at a time when humans are weak and at their most vulnerable?**

Will a human (in all senses of the word) step up to the plate?

Hey,

I am trying to run an emulator on my machine (3600 ryzen, b450 mobo) but I am getting error message:  

*"This computer does not support Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x) or it is being exclusively used by Hyper-V. HAXM cannot be installed.* 

*Please ensure Hyper-V is disabled in Windows Features, or refer to the Intel HAXM documentation for more information."*

&amp;#x200B;

I googled but the fixes always resulted in going into the device security-tab but for me it shows a different result in this tab than shown. I have a message there "standard hardware security not supported".  


Any ideas?

## [12][Which layout, view group, or view combination to use for non-scrolling grid?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fjjjpf/which_layout_view_group_or_view_combination_to/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fjjjpf/which_layout_view_group_or_view_combination_to/

The interface of an activity will always be a 2x3 (landscape) or 3Ã—2 (portrait) fixed grid with no scrolling. I have a Gridview inside a ConstraintLayout but it doesn't work well with screen rotation from what I see, I think because it is scrollable. Which combination should I use?
