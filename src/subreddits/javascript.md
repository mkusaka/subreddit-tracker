(french man from Quebec excuse my english)

**A)** Do you think Javascript is a good programming language to learn in 2020 or the Java stack or C# stack with Blazor etc are more suited for webdev and a stable career ?

**B)** Do you feel that the performance of native programming language like C++ could threaten Javascript dominance in webdev with Web assembly (or another language) or it's too far away down the road or not "production ready" to worry about it ?

**C)** Why most C# or Java programmer keep doing web development in their stack and keep thinking it's better and JS is shit...is it because they don't want to take the time to learn JS the right way ? or they are stuck in the 80's with their OO concept and dislike functional programming ?

I posted a JS quiz from an app that I built yesterday and it turned out that some of the questions were incorrect and/or badly worded. Thanks to those that took the time to provide constructive responses. I am also sorry since it seems that i might have broken some reddit rules by posting the link.

I was wondering if this community will be interested in providing some questions and answers as comments to this thread. I know there are a lot of experienced programmers in the channel that might even have the privilege of conducting interviews for their teams . I also know that this channel is not for learning JS but I think current/future developers might benefit from some shared knowledge/experience.

For those that are willing to contribute, I am looking for non-library/framework-specific questions, preferably in multiple choice format, that sheds a light on whether one truly understands JS and all its intricacies.

Thanks!

Trying to shift career paths. I’m taking a course and reading a ton, but am a little lost. 

I was able to rewrite my code, link the HTML/css and host on AWS, which was a feat in itself for me (accomplished by persistent googling). It’s  a simple music visualizer. 

As far as the page layout though...
One thing I’m having trouble with in Js is how to position things. From the resources I’m reading, layout can be done via css, HTML and in fact the Js script itself. I guess I am confused about how you mentally organize this process? It seems hard to figure out exactly what point to start at, or rather which file should be controlling what, how the hierarchy of files works.. can someone do a breakdown? Maybe not ELI5, but ELI15?
