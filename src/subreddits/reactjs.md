During development, I'd like to make Dev Tools pause the code where the error in my code is thrown. Sure there's a stack trace printed in the console like it's some Fortran program, while I'd like actually being in the stack where I can inspect variables, run stuff, go up and down in the stack etc. For now I'm not interested in alternatives such as putting a breakpoint in the questionable line, or add a conditional breakpoint, because these workarounds are annoying, distract and slow us down. There's a reason for Dev Tools and its Pause on exceptions functionality. Also, I can't pause on handled exceptions because Babel and related workarounds throw exceptions like crazy, so my actual exception is dwarfed among the hundreds that Babel, core.js etc. throws (blackboxing doesn't help due to reported Chrome bug)

Hi, I am a fairly new react developer with a little over 1 year of experience. I am developing an application that consists of various graphs, reports and charts often dealing with lots of computations, calculations and grouping of data. 

I take in all the data along with the reference tables required from DB and store them in redux. As a result making any changes via the filters or changes to the source data in general takes a lot of time to perform computations to all the graphs and reports and therefore, makes the application significantly slow. 

Do you guys have any tips on how to deal with the situation and how you design and develop your applications which deals with a lot of data. thank you

I’m working on a React App and I need the best way to report any crashes that occur in the app. I thought about using error boundary to fire an email containing details of crashes every time there’s one, but I believe there’s a better way to do this than just Error boundary doing the work.

I am currently trying to make a "Edit Details" page where the user of the app can edit the details they've set when signing up. This needs to be done in React, JavaScript.

These details would include their full name, email, username, updating password and updating their avatar.

Backend includes Django and MySQL for database.

Any suggestions?

I am trying to better understand this hook so I came up with this code, but on every  button click in the parent component, the child component gets re-rendered (check out the console). What am I missing?  Thanks in advance to whomever can help shine some light on this elusive feature.

    const Child = ({name}) =&gt; {
        console.log("rendering child"); 
        return(&lt;div&gt;Hello, {name} &lt;/div&gt;); 
    }
    
    const MemoShowcase = () =&gt; {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0) 
    const [name, setName ] = useState("") 
    var MemoChild = React.memo(Child) 
    return (&lt;div&gt;                
         &lt;input type="text" onChange = {e =&gt; {setName(e.target.value)}}/&gt; {count}
         &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; {setCount(count + 1)}}&gt;increment&lt;/button&gt;      &lt;MemoChild name={name}/&gt;             
    &lt;/div&gt;) }
    export default MemoShowcase

I  am trying to implement instagram like love on posts. It is working for one single post.

Since i am using same state, when i click love on one post it gets changed in every post.

How to optimize following code so that i can add love on one posts without affecting other posts.  


code:

Togle between red and white love icon on click

    &lt;div onClick={this.handleFavourite} className="favourite-details"&gt;
    {
    this.state.isFavourite ? &lt;img src={Favourite2} width="40%" /&gt; : &lt;img src={Favourite1} width="40%" /&gt;
    }
    &lt;/div&gt;

//function

    handleFavourite(e) {
            this.setState({
                isFavourite: !this.state.isFavourite
            });
        }

//state

    this.state = {
                isFavourite: false
            };

I have a parent GameRoom component that requests data from my server after it mounts. Part of this data is only used to initialize the child Game and GameSetup components. My issue is, how do I store that data so that i can pass it to those components in the render method? I could store them in state, but I feel that's not the best way since the GameRoom component doesn't need that data itself. I've tried setting two gameInit and setupInit components equal to the initialization data, but for some reason they never get set. I could also have the child components fetch their initial data themselves, but I figured it would be better this way because I'd have at least some initial display. What's the best way to do this?

    
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import Game from './Game';
    import GameSetup from './GameSetup';
    
    let gameInit, setupInit;
    
    class GameRoom extends Component {
      id = this.props.match.params.id;
    
      state = {};
    
      boundHandlers = {
        receiveGameRoomData: receiveGameRoomDataHandler.bind(this)
      };
    
      componentDidMount() {
        this.props.socket.on('gameRoomData', this.boundHandlers.receiveGameRoomData);
        this.props.socket.send(JSON.stringify({event: 'getGameRoomData', payload: this.id}));
      }
      componentWillUnmount() {
        this.props.socket.off('gameRoomData', this.boundHandlers.receiveGameRoomData);
      }
    
      render() {
        const renderMainArea = () =&gt; {
          if (this.state.gameInProgress) return &lt;Game socket={this.props.socket} initData={setupInit} /&gt;;
          else if (this.state.gameInProgress === false) return &lt;GameSetup socket={this.props.socket} initData={gameInit} /&gt;;
          return null; // this is only reached when gameInProgress is undefined, meaning there's no data from the server yet
        };
        return (
          &lt;React.Fragment&gt;
            {renderMainArea()}
            {this.state.scoreBoard ? &lt;ScoreBoard scores={this.state.scoreBoard} /&gt; : null}
          &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
        )
      }
    
    }
    
    function receiveGameRoomDataHandler(data) {
      data = JSON.parse(data);
      let inSetup = "setupData" in Object.keys(data);
      if (inSetup) setupInit = data.setupData;
      else gameInit = data.gameData;
      inSetup ? delete data.setupData : delete data.gameData;
      this.setState(data);
    }
    
    class ScoreBoard extends Component {
    
      render() {
        const scoreData = this.props.scores;
        const playerNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(scoreData);
        let tableData = '';
        playerNames.forEach(name =&gt; {
          tableData += `&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;${name}&lt;br/&gt;${scoreData[name]}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;`;
        });
    
        return (
          &lt;table dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: tableData}}&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
        )
      }
    }
    
    export default GameRoom;
