## [3][Rails &amp; Amazon SES for emails. Best practices and throttling?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hgrr27/rails_amazon_ses_for_emails_best_practices_and/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hgrr27/rails_amazon_ses_for_emails_best_practices_and/
---
Hi all,

For a Rails site I'd like to switch to Amazon SES for sending emails because we're having some trouble delivering to the big providers from our own servers.

Now, SES has a pretty low throttling threshold by default (1/sec) which is a problem due to the nature of my application. My users send out invoices once a month, in bursts of thousands. Once I exceed Amazon's rate, emails get rejected. I need to do some throttling / queuing *somewhere*.

The way I see it, I can do that in 2 different ways:

1. Have the Rails app talk directly to the SES SMTP and do the throttling in-app, perhaps through something like DelayedJob?
2. Have the Rails app talk to a local MTA like Exim, which sets up a relay to SES, including throttling and retries.

Options 2 seems to be more robust, but it requires yet another service to be configured and maintained.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, anyone know any good guides how to set up SES with SNS on AWS to get insight into the individual bounces, rejects, etc.? I found their original documentation a bit lacking.

I recorded a short exploration of the view\_component gem from Github. I have to say I'm pretty excited about it. There's some good stuff going on in the Stimulus Reflex community around ViewComponentReflex([https://github.com/joshleblanc/view\_component\_reflex](https://github.com/joshleblanc/view_component_reflex)), so I figured I'd start here before jumping into that: [https://youtu.be/oKqJmEAn-X0](https://youtu.be/oKqJmEAn-X0)

Hi, i've made a gem to selectively track changes on AR models, where audited gem would be an overkill. ActsAsTracked can be plugged into ActiveRecord model, and then used whenever you need a history of changes and actors made on the record.

You can find docs in the [repository](https://github.com/ramblingcode/acts-as-tracked)

Blog post [here](https://www.ramblingcode.dev/posts/track_changes_on_your_activerecord_models/)

Example usage in this [project](https://github.com/ramblingcode/rails6-acts-as-tracked-usage)

Hope you find it useful.

Glimmer DSL for Opal v0.0.8 is out with table data-binding support, including selection, sorting, and editing (can be easily styled with standard CSS). Glimmer DSL for Opal is an experimental web GUI adaptor for webifying [Glimmer](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer) desktop apps (i.e. apps built with [Glimmer DSL for SWT](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-swt)) via [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Opal](https://opalrb.com/) without changing a line of code. Apps may then be custom-styled for the web via standard CSS.

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hgcqvv/how_can_i_get_amount_from_braintree_in_a_safe_way/
---
I'm currently trying to integrate Braintree into my app. Basically, I want to allow customers to top up their account's credit via PayPal. The way I wanted it to work would be that the customers visit `Billing#new`, are able to select/type the amount that they, then click the "Pay with PayPal" button and after that was successful they get their selected amount as credit to their account. 

After reading through the Braintree ["Get started guide"](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/start/overview) I got nearly everything working in sandbox mode. The only thing that I don't have is a safe way to get the selected/typed amount from the client. Basically what they teach in their starter guide and what I have done so far is to create a form in `Billing#new` where they render the PayPal button via their JS SDK. After the customer has clicked on the button and payed with PayPal, the SDK provides a callback function where I then submit the form with the payment_nonce to `Billing#create`. Inside `Billing#create` I currently have this code:

&gt; result = gateway.transaction.sale(amount: "10.00", payment_method_nonce: nonce_from_the_client)

This code creates the entire transaction but hardcodes the required amount. [In their example app](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_rails_example/blob/master/app/controllers/checkouts_controller.rb#L22) they handle the amount via `params[:amount]` but add a note to not do this in production. But they don't say what to use instead.

I'm feeling a little bit lost here. They say not to use `params[:amount]` but every other option that I have explored quickly falls apart too. I'd like to use something like webhooks but can't find any usage example in their documentation or online.

I have a variable created in an action within one of my ruby controllers. I can access it from the corresponding view, but how can I pass it so that my JS can grab it? Does it need to be embedded in the view as a hidden tag/variable?

I am working on a Rails project and I am using namespacing for the models and controllers. That is the child models (`admin` and `student`) are put in a directory called `user` and the controllers are put in a directory called `users`.

I also have `admins_controller` and `students_controller` that use the `admin` model and the `student` model respectively. These controllers are namespaced using  `users` directory.

&amp;#x200B;

I then have a `personal_info` model that contains more details about the `user`, such as gender, age, date of birth. The `personal_info` table has a **one-to-one** relationship with the `user` model.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's my code**;

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Info model**:

    class PersonalInfo &lt; ApplicationRecord
    
      belongs_to :user
    end

&amp;#x200B;

**User model**:

    class User &lt; ApplicationRecord
    
      has_secure_password
      has_one :personal_info, class_name: 'PersonalInfo', dependent: :destroy
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :personal_info, allow_destroy: true
    end

&amp;#x200B;

**Admin model**:

    class User::Admin &lt; User
    end

&amp;#x200B;

**Admin Controller**:

    class Users::AdminsController &lt; ApplicationController
      before_action :set_admin, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
    
      # GET /admins
      # GET /admins.json
      def index

    &lt;% end %&gt;
    
    &lt;%= link_to 'Back', users_admins_path %&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I try to create a new `admin` or update an already existing admin after adding inputs to the displayed form no `Personal Info` data is saved on the database. They are all **nil**.

&amp;#x200B;

    PersonalInfo Load (0.3ms) SELECT "personal_infos".* FROM "personal_infos" WHERE "personal_infos"."user_id" = $1 LIMIT $2 [["user_id", 6], ["LIMIT", 1]]
    
    =&gt; #&lt;PersonalInfo id: 2, first_name: nil, last_name: nil, phone: nil, gender: nil, dob: nil, address: nil, city: nil, state: nil, country: nil, user_id: 6, created_at: "2020-06-26 13:37:16", updated_at: "2020-06-26 13:37:16"&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to get this resolved, but no luck yet. Any form of help will be highly appreciated.

So i have a multi user blog platform, it's a simple crud app but my issue is with the association because i have many types of users (i have simple user that can write blog post and it show his name) and i have a company account (which is like the user but have other information like company website instead of the user username)


my issue is how to handle the association (i already implemented the user model using device) which have_many blog 

so every blog have the belong to associated to the user

how to add another user type (Company) which have the the same many blog 

i searched and found the STI but it's not what i need as there is differences between the users types ( i may add another type later) 



should i use polymorphic association or are there another method to this relationship    





TL;DR i have user, CompanyUser, blablaUser which all of them can make blog post how to make the association ?
