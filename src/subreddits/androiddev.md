This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hey Droids,  
Some of you might remember me from my previous project - [https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fvmktf/learn\_jetpack\_compose\_from\_examples\_that\_show\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fvmktf/learn_jetpack_compose_from_examples_that_show_the/)  


I'm back with another quick weekend project - [JetpackCompose.app](https://JetpackCompose.app)  


https://preview.redd.it/pmh0h3k1zz451.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eae3f7536a90eaef548df60289044a569d28878

The first tool that I added on this site makes recommendations for the right JetpackCompose API to use based on what you use today with the current Android UI Toolkit. Very IFTTT-eque if you will!   


Here's a quick demo -

Would love for you'll to try it. There's more coming on the site so stay tuned!
## [4][Clean architecture everywhere, or dirty coding. Where does one draw the line?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/h982qv/clean_architecture_everywhere_or_dirty_coding/)

I am still re-writing my two demo apps at the moment, but I am hitting on certain roadblocks where clean architecture actually made the code worse, where the coding was actually more straightforward and understandable if I did away with LiveData observing, for example, and just read the data one-time while creating Views. It's dirty coding I think, something where a non-conventional, non-elegant approach or beginner-level method is used, but gets the job done right away. 

I have heard about clean architecture coding, but I also heard about KISS which I think is the same as dirty coding (unless I am mistaken), but where does one draw the line?
## [5][I'm losing downloads day by day. I'm getting lower and lower in a popular keyword ranking. What is going on? Is it natural behavior of a published app lifecycle? How does keywords ranking works exactly in Play Store?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/h9c9wd/im_losing_downloads_day_by_day_im_getting_lower/)

Hi,

I have my first game app **published for about 1.5 years now.** I have between **100k-200k downloads.**  
On the best days **I had 2k downloads/day and on a bad day I had like 300.**

***HOWEVER,***

in the recent days I see with a keyword ranking tool that I use that my app is losing rank in a popular game keyword. There was a time when **I was in the top 20 in USA** but I started losing that so right now I'm more closer to the 100th place and **I started to lose downloads lightning fast.**

From the "bad day 300" **I slipped down to an average 100/day, but sometimes even \~50.**  


It is important to note that I reached these number with almost **0 budget advertising**, like negligible amount. Only posts on forums, social media, and I had 1-2 posts on websites about android games and that is it basically.

*Needless to say that my income has been greatly reduced.*  


My question:  


*  Is it a natural behavior of the constant competition on the Play Store?
*  What can I do to prevent this? I cannot stuff more keywords to my app's description it is already has like 7% density, like ever 10th-15th word is that particular keyword. Could I get algorithm penalty from stuffing more keywords?
*  Is it a natural fluctuation of Play Store's algorithm? Can I expect better numbers ever again without touching anything?
* I also thinking about maybe the target audience simply depleted, since my game is a sub-genre and maybe everyone who really wanted to try it already tried it so that's it, game over?  

* I tried stuffing another popular keyword but it just made things worse in the past 2 weeks.
* Buying keyword boost is out of the table for me. First of all it is prohibited, I don't want the ban hammer, secondly I don't believe in its efficiency and cost per value.   


Please help if you can,  
Adam

Does anyone know how to make a scale view like this one or if there's any library that can get a similar  behavior ?

You can ask questions about how to localize different words and phrases into another language, let the users check your localization for mistakes and open the localization files to let users contribute to your app or game.

Awhile ago I expressed that the best way forward for any Android Developer is also selling apps independently on your own website. I really want to support independent Android Developers plus I bought a few new Android devices and I am enjoying the power/freedom of Android again.

I've been doing Android development now off &amp; on for \~5 years, I'm a self-taught dev who has occasionally struggled along over the years to piece things together.

This is a project I first made a few years back and published to the Play Store. I maintained it minimally over the last few years &amp; also used it to help me start learning Kotlin. It doesn't have all the latest &amp; greatest libraries but it's very simple and minimal. I hope another Android dev out there can gain value from it.
