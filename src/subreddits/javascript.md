As the title says it, I am trying to make a list of modern UI frameworks that support no-build-no-cli code as "first class" citizens because not everyone needs an SPA

Three primary features would be: routing, state management and templating

1. MithrilJS - Very good at state management and routing but you need their proprietary JS API functions to do any kind of templating/UI. (Score: 2/3)
2. RiotJS - templating/UI - good, routing - good with a library, state management - couldn't find anything actively maintained. (Score: 2/3)
3. AlpineJS - Apart from routing, state management and templating seems good. (Score: 2/3)
4. VueJS - routing, state management have excellent support, templates are second class and held within a string variable, some sort of &lt;template&gt; tag would have been better. (Score: 2/3)

Any more input/discussion would be nice, I know there are a gazillion workarounds, that's why I have mentioned "first class" citizens, so users don't have to go through the trouble of maintaining those workarounds down the line.
