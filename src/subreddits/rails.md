Hey! I'm interested in getting into Ruby on Rails, and I'm wondering whether any of you might be able to point me in the direction of some good resources.

I have active subscriptions to [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com/) and [GoRails.com](https://gorails.com/), and I have the GitHub Student Developer Pack. My end-goal is to build a basic social-networking site for my school, not to become a paid web developer!

I have loads of experience in Python, HTML, JS and CSS, and I launched myself into a Basics of Ruby course on Lynda, so I have enough experience there too.

I was watching this free Udemy course, which looked perfect; [https://www.udemy.com/course/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/learn/lecture/4336792?start=240](https://www.udemy.com/course/8-beautiful-ruby-on-rails-apps-in-30-days/learn/lecture/4336792?start=240), but in the Announcements section it was apparently severely outdated. Does anyone know of something similar? I honestly prefer video content to reading (with the exception of books).

And I'd prefer to not spend heaps. I've looked at The Odin Project and the Essential RoR Training courses on Lynda but the RoR course seems far too theoretical. I want to get creating ASAP.

Many thanks!

Hi, I've been struggling with writing a passing cucumber that deletes a resource and shows a confirmation dialog to the user. The controller sends a request to an external API, so I stubbed this request. I finally found out what was going wrong and wrote this blog post about it. Hope it'll help some (some day).

Hello mates, I spend some time to find the simplest possible configuration to start a Rails project using Docker.

[https://github.com/bdavidxyz/simplest-rails-docker](https://github.com/bdavidxyz/simplest-rails-docker)

I picked some ideas from other projects from GitHub, trying to remove as much files and as much lines per file as possible.

With Ruby-on-Rails, you can't start a project without a properly initialized, configured, and started database. You also can't start the local server without a webpack dev server running (from Rails 6 I guess). So that's make 3 services running at least before even to print a "hello world" page.

This kind of project is extremely useful to test various tools and versions without polluting your local machine. I find it also more professional to use Docker instead of brittle, quickly-too-old documentation. So it could be a starting point for a more serious configuration.

What do you think ? What could be simplified ? Do you have more simple examples ? How do you test tools in isolation ? Thanks for your returns, and stay safe :)

I often need to run super old ruby/rails projects alongside new ones on my Mac.  Besides Docker is there a sane way to pull this off? I've noticed a ton of problems with running old + new ruby (things like ssl libs) and multiple versions of Postgres are a headache. But using docker with a non-docker team can also be a hassle. So just wondering what others are doing.

I have a column in my leads table called

The problem I'm having is when I do:

It gives me the full date and time ü§î, what is the right method please?

---
Edit: this has been solved, scroll down to see my solution

Oh hi, it's me again! :)

Still trying to do a GraphQL api with rails, but I've hit a snag. I am doing an order management system, and it's not going to be worth much unless I can add products to an order. I have set them up with a Product model and an Order model with a has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many relationship. ie. Product has\_many orders and Order has\_many products. that part seems to be working fine, I made a join table and as far as I can see it works.

The problem arrises when I am using GraphQL. The documentation is hard to find once you move away from the most basic queries and mutations. alas, I am in the process for doing the CreateOrder mutation for my api, as I need to add products on creation, i.e whatever the user orders.

&amp;#x200B;

first I had the ProductType for an argument, but I realized that's a non starter and found out I need to create an input type for it, so I did:

&amp;#x200B;

At this point this, I don't know if this is even the correct way of doing it, because I wasn't able to find a Ruby example online. Either way, GraphQL isn't complaining at least. So I try calling the mutation like so:

&amp;#x200B;

and it is at this point that everything falls apart as rails gives me the error:

&amp;#x200B;

it would be nice if someone in this awesome community could give me a pointer in the right direction, either by telling me what's wrong here, or by sharing a tutorial that covers something similar, because I haven't been able to find one on my own :/
