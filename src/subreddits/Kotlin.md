Hey! I've just released a lightweight and developer-driven API to query and parse OBD commands.

It's written in pure Kotlin and platform agnostic with a simple and easy to use interface, so we can hack our cars without any hassle.

This is the repository link with the installation and usage guide -&gt; [https://github.com/eltonvs/kotlin-obd-api](https://github.com/eltonvs/kotlin-obd-api)

I've been using this API in some personal projects for several months and decided to release it to the public now.

Simply explains how to use property configuration in spring. It is a try run for git pods. I love how git pods works.

 Hi. Once again I am asking you for help. I am learning to use the Room  library. This is an application that records notes. I was able to save  notes and show them all. However, I can't do deleting a note on  onLongClick and editing a note on onClick. I tried in different ways but  always crashes applications. I will be grateful for any tip.

## [5][Coding interviews in Kotlin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/fym4tl/coding_interviews_in_kotlin/)

Over the last year at work I have been using Kotlin almost exclusively, and as a result I am most comfortable with it now. I find that now when I write Java I make lots of dumb mistakes like forgetting semicolons or the `new` keyword. Previously Java was my go-to interview language but given how little I write it I think these small mistakes would give a poor impression if I continued to use it during coding live challenges. 

Does anyone have experience going on the interview circuit using Kotlin for these challenges? How was that received? I'm a huge fan of the language but I recognize that many companies have outdated views on it, perhaps thinking of it as an exclusively Android tool (I'm a backend dev). Were companies generally receptive or did they raise eyebrows when you would use it? 

The other option I am thinking is investing time learning more Python. That is a nice interviewing language in general and the syntax is different enough that I think I can effectively switch from "kotlin-mode" to "python-mode" without too much fuss. The downside is that I don't have nearly as much experience in this language.

## [7][[Hadoop] Does one need to know a lot of Java before getting into Hadoop ecosystem using Kotlin only?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/fyhcy5/hadoop_does_one_need_to_know_a_lot_of_java_before/)

I'm actually from a python only background. I have basic syntax level understanding of both C++ and Java, but I'm planning to move forward and explore the Java APIs for Spark, Flink, Presto, Kafka etc **using Kotlin instead of Java.**   


I'm the crazy guy thinking that scala is going to be doomed soon because of the way it's headed. So people please let me know  whether skipping most of Java and straight away learning Kotlin and building hadoop stuff is possible/advised?  


I dont think I'm violating any of the subreddit rules. but if mods feel its bad please remove it!   


Thanks!
