**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Hello all.

I kindly request your review to this simple variation of the classical Treiber-stack used to monitor idle threads in a threadpool.

The problem:

Every threadpool holds a number of threads it re-uses to execute tasks that had been submitted to it.

Work-distribution is an important aspect of parallel and concurrent execution: an application needs to partitian, distribute and schedule

the work into tasks and threads in order to achieve maximum cpu utilization.

Every thread in a threadpool can either be active (executing tasks) or idle (waiting for a task to be submitted to the threadpool).

An old-fashion approach is to have one queue for the entire thread pool and have the threads waiting on one mutex, using one condition variable.

when a thread finishes to execute a task, it goes back to the global queue to pop a new one, and if it doesn't find any - it sleeps on the condition variable

until a new task is submitted to the pool and the thread is notified by the pusher.

Needless to say, this is very naive approach that doesn't handle high loads.

Modern approaches use one queue each worker, possibly a lock free one. threads either steal work from other queues when they run out of tasks,

either they do the reverse thing by sharing tasks when they detect that other threads are idle.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, whether we just want to enqueue a task to the right thread, or we want to share work, we need to know which threads are idle and which are not.

To do so, I've modified the classical Treiber stack algorithm to handle this task of monitoring idle threads.

This is NOT a general-purpose lock free stack. this has a very specific goal under very specific environment.

In my threadpool, threads are stored in a vector, and their ID is basically the index they sit on. We can use this fact to use integers instead of pointers.

The idle-worker-stack is also bounded, since the maximum amount of threads is fixed.

This also means, that the data stored in the stack can only be an integer number from 0 to (worker-size - 1).

&amp;#x200B;

So we can basically "ditch" the old node structure in favor of a simple integer array.

the index of a cell is the index of an idle thread, while the integer the cell contains points to the next idle worker.

we also don't have to worry about memory management, since we just allocate this fixed array in the stack construction, and deallocate the memory fully during the stack destruction.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real change from the classical Treiber-stack algorithm is the aba stamp we keep in the cursor ("head") member - this prevents the nasty ABA problem that the classical design has.

&amp;#x200B;

The code:

    class idle_worker_stack {
    
    	struct alignas(8) cursor_ctx {
    		int32_t pos;
    		uint32_t aba;
    	};
    
    private:
    	std::atomic&lt;cursor_ctx&gt; m_cursor;
    	std::unique_ptr&lt;std::atomic_intptr_t[]&gt; m_stack;
    
    public:
    	idle_worker_stack(size_t size);
    
    	void push(int32_t index) noexcept;
    	int32_t pop() noexcept;
    };
    
    idle_worker_stack::idle_worker_stack(size_t size) {
    	m_stack = std::make_unique&lt;std::atomic_intptr_t[]&gt;(size);
    	for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
    		m_stack[i] = -1;
    	}
    
    	cursor_ctx cursor;
    	cursor.pos = -1;
    	cursor.aba = 0;
    
    	m_cursor = cursor;
    }
    
    void idle_worker_stack::push(int32_t index) noexcept {
    	while (true) {
    		auto current_idle = m_cursor.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    		m_stack[index].store(current_idle.pos, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    
    		cursor_ctx new_cursor;
    		new_cursor.pos = index;
    		new_cursor.aba = current_idle.aba + 1;
    
    		if (m_cursor.compare_exchange_weak(
    			current_idle,
    			new_cursor,
    			std::memory_order_release,
    			std::memory_order_relaxed)) {
    			return;
    		}
    	}
    }
    
    int32_t idle_worker_stack::pop() noexcept {
    	while (true) {
    		auto cursor = m_cursor.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    		if (cursor.pos == -1) {
    			return -1;
    		}
    
    		auto next_idle_worker = m_stack[cursor.pos].load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    
    		cursor_ctx new_cursor;
    		new_cursor.pos = next_idle_worker;
    		new_cursor.aba = cursor.aba + 1;
    
    		if (m_cursor.compare_exchange_weak(
    			cursor,
    			new_cursor,
    			std::memory_order_release,
    			std::memory_order_relaxed)) {
    			return cursor.pos;
    		}
    	}
    }

&amp;#x200B;

A few notes:

1. the memory barriers are only needed to prevent reordering. the workers themselves are protected with a lock. this is why most of the operation only require relaxed operation. when we use release m-o, it's only because we want to prevent the CAS to be reordered before whatever comes before it.
2. this implementation looks more of a "flat list" or an "unrolled list" than a node-based-stack.
3. there can be only &lt;&lt;size&gt;&gt; producers, where &lt;&lt;size&gt;&gt; is the number of the workers. there can be infinite amount of consumers. if the stack is empty when popped, it should return -1.
4. should a padding be added between m\_cursor and m\_stack? should the individual integers in the array be padded between them? I couldn't decide myself.
5. pushing and popping is done under a loop - so we can use weak CAS instead of a strong one to milk a little more performance from the hardware.
6. please ignore the bit-ness issues here. this WILL be modified to work correctly under 32 bit. assume for now that this design is written to work only under 64-bit CPU's that support atomic operation on integers.

Your comments, remarks, reviews, questions and answers are welcome.

I've been writing a class to wrap around part of a C library that requires function pointers for callbacks. The callback should be instance-specific; however, a function pointer can't be made out of anything that involves `this` (`this` is a function parameter, and parameters can't be constant expressions).

Since all instances of this class will be `static`, I was able to come up with the following solution that I found to be interesting:

    template&lt;auto&amp; inst, auto func&gt;
    consteval auto make_member_callback() {
        return [](auto... args) { (inst.*func)(args...); };
    }
    
    // MyClass is a class that takes a function pointer as an argument
    constinit static MyClass mc {
        make_member_callback&lt;mc, &amp;MyClass::someCallback&gt;()
    };
(Try it online [here](https://godbolt.org/z/-Zo9S4) (or with a templated lambda [here](https://godbolt.org/z/erxmS-)))
 
My work is with a real-time operating system written in C, so being able to use this with all of the callbacks required by hardware will be helpful. Would anyone else find this useful?

I'd also enjoy it if, in the future, this could happen within a constructor. Right now this is prevented by `constexpr` parameters, though I would propose that a `constexpr/consteval` constructor (i.e. one that initializes a static object) should be able to access `this` at compile-time, since it appears that the static object's address/instance can be known.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Someone pointed out that a variadic generic lambda could be used instead of a templated lambda, which I think is simpler (and doesn't affect the resulting program). Changed the above example to match.

**Edit 2:** Thanks to everyone who suggested different variations of this code. As I've spent more time on this, I've been able to set the callback during "construction:"

    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    
    template&lt;auto&amp; v, auto f&gt;
    constexpr auto member_callback = [](auto... args) { (v.*f)(args...); };
    
    struct MyClass {
    public:
        using Callback = void (*)(const char *);
    
    private:
        int value;
        Callback callback;
    
        void myCallback(const char* data) { value = printf("%s: %d", data, value); }
    
    public:
        consteval MyClass(int v = 0) : value(v), callback(nullptr) {}
    
        template&lt;MyClass&amp; MC&gt;
        constexpr static auto&amp; init() {
            MC.callback = member_callback&lt;MC, &amp;MyClass::myCallback&gt;;
            return MC;
        }
    
        Callback getCallback() const { return callback; }
    };
    
    int main() {
        constinit static MyClass mc = (mc = MyClass{42}, MyClass::init&lt;mc&gt;());
        mc.getCallback()("hi");
        return 0;
    }

Say you have (in non-library code) a

    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;

do you write

    auto iter = find_if(cbegin(v), cend(v), [](auto i) { ... });

anticipating that ADL will find `std::cbegin()`, `std::cend()` and `std::find_if()` because the vector is a type from `std`, or do you spell the namespace on the function calls?
