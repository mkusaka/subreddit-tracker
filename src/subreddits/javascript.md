What's the memory difference of an array of 1000 objects all being one of like 1-5 references to the same objects vs an array of 1000 integers? Im dealing with a large number of objects in one of my projects and i'm trying to optimize as much as possible, I was going to pass the indexes of functions around instead of an array of bound functions, but I'm not sure what some of the lower level implications are.

[This is what I'm referring to.](https://i.redd.it/530vtwzl3cc51.png)

What is causing this, and how do I fix it short of just adding a day to the date object?

- I have worked with react quite a lot, but have never worked with vue, angular, svelete, etc... 
- I am not asking “what is best?” Or “which should I choose?” (I find those posts annoying)
- which types of web apps would play to the strengths of each framework?
