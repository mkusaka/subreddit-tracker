I'm trying to add a MapView to my android app. On the docs it says I need to forward some methods, what does that mean?

 [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView) 

When I try to override the methods it says they're final and cannot be overwritten

    class TestMapView(context : Context) : MapView(context) {
        override fun onCreate() { //Cannot be overwritten
    
        }
    
        override fun onStart() {
    
        }
    
        override fun onResume() {
    
        }
    
        override fun onPause() {
    
        }
    
        override fun onStop() {
    
        }
    
        override fun onDestroy() {
    
        }
    }

How do I go about properly implementing this?

I have written an Android app in Kotlin and I need to be able to identify the nouns in the sentence a user enters. spaCy can solve this problem but the problem is it's only for Python, so I can't implement it in my Android app. Any suggestions?
