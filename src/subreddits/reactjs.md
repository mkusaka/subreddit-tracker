Hi everyone!

About a year ago, I decided that I didn't really like the current GitHub UI for reading code and doing pull requests so my brother and I decided to put our React/Redux skills to the test and make our own. I am really excited to show off our results and get all of your feedback :)

The site is called [Mergefly](https://mergefly.com) and we tried to add in as many fun features as we could think of such as multiple tabs, a file tree for navigating code, full code context, floating comments, live updates, hotkeys and Slack integration. We also use the Monaco Editor for displaying code so you get a lot of the built in features that you see in VSCode. Also, for fun, we added support for all the monaco themes so you have around 50 to choose from.

I'm really proud of how the site turned out as well as how well my React skills have grown and I really hope you guys enjoy it too! If you guys have any ideas for improvements please let me know! It's still very much a work in progress.

I have been doing this for a while but find myself wondering what the point is.

If the user is entering an email and then pressing `Submit`, what exactly do we gain from setting `email` state to the latest character entered?

Isn't it just as good to do something like this?

    onSubmit = (currentInputValue) =&gt; doSomeLogic(currentInputValue)

What's more - by setting state on each key press, am I not wasting computing resources and risk running into issues like missing characters if the user types or backspaces too fast?

I have a crud rest api and I want some simple UI to work with it. I know there is a react-admin, but before jumping into it I would like to know is there any alternative.

Hi there!

I am beginner to react web app. And i switched from Unity to React about 4 months ago. I have designed a very simple react web app. But now i am thinking of adding google ads. I looked around on on Google and i found few npm packages.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Note: According to google it will take 24-48 hours to display ads*

But in my case i want to display some dummy ads so that my google adsense account do not any harmful notification from Google.
