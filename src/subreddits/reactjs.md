We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [10][react-admin: display &lt;SelectInput&gt; inside &lt;Datagrid&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f8pnqj/reactadmin_display_selectinput_inside_datagrid/)

After fetching the data I'm displaying it within a `&lt;Datagrid&gt;` as `&lt;TextFields&gt;`. I'm trying to display one of the columns as a `&lt;SelectInput&gt;` with the values coming from the API. Code example should make more sense than my explanation:

An example of the record from the db:

        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "foo",
          "status": "active"
        },

In the above, `status` can have two values: `active` or `passive`. As for my (not working) code:

    export const ProjectList = props =&gt; (
      &lt;List {...props}&gt;
        &lt;Datagrid&gt;
          &lt;TextField source="id" /&gt;
          &lt;TextField source="name" /&gt;
          &lt;ReferenceInput label="Status" source="status" reference="status"&gt;
            &lt;SelectField optionText="status" /&gt;
          &lt;/ReferenceInput&gt;
          &lt;EditButton /&gt;
        &lt;/Datagrid&gt;
      &lt;/List&gt;
    );

The idea is to display the "Status" column as a select element, allowing to change its value directly from the `&lt;Datagrid&gt;`.

Any idea what am I missing here?

## [12][What's the recommended way to render SVG's in a component?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f8ietg/whats_the_recommended_way_to_render_svgs_in_a/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f8ietg/whats_the_recommended_way_to_render_svgs_in_a/

I'm coming from a pure HTML + CSS world where I would normally do this with the following

    &lt;svg&gt;
        &lt;use xlink:href="./pathToSVGFile#svg_name&gt; &lt;/use&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;

I've tried do this in React using the styled-components library but it's been unsuccessful:

    const styledSVG = styled.svg`
        /* some styling */
    `;
    
    const Icon = () =&gt; {
        return (
            &lt;styledSVG&gt;
                &lt;use xlinkHref={icon}&gt; &lt;/use&gt;
            &lt;/styledSVG&gt;
        );
    }
    
    export default Icon;

Whether I import the value of "icon" before passing it to xlinkHref or if I just pass a string version of the path itself, the svg is not rendered on screen. If I change the styled-component to be an &lt;img&gt; instead of a &lt;svg&gt; then I can display the svg by passing it in with the src attribute. However, using this approach I believe I lose out being able to style the icon through the CSS 'fill' property. Anyone have any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

Thanks all. I ended up going with /u/bakedleaf 's solution since I'm already using CRA. In case someone in the future is looking at this for reference here's the [docs link](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/#adding-svgs).

Here's how I ended up using it to apply the same style to different SVG's. Keep in mind this is all done using the styled-components library.

    // Import svg's as React Components
    import { ReactComponent as BookmarkIcon } from './pathToSVG';
    import { ReactComponent as ChatIcon } from './pathToSVG';
    
    import styled from 'styled-components'
    
    const StyledIcon = styled.svg`
        /* Styling that all icons will receive*/
    `;
    
    
    // assuming we want to render a styledIcon somewhere, you can call it like this.
    &lt;StyledIcon as={BookmarkIcon}/&gt; 
    
    // The 'as' attribute will render the given content with the styles applied by 
    // the current styled-component

&amp;#x200B;
