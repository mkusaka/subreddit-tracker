This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

 As the title says, I am a 16 year old high-school student that has been developing for android for the past year. I've created an app called wearAmask for android that reminds you to take your mask whenever you leave your home, work or any other location.

wearAmask works by allowing users to add a location (address) on a map by holding down on the map or typing an address. Once you choose a location, you can select the radius of the region, choose a color and enter a location name.

Once you enter a location, or even many locations if you'd like, wearAmask will automatically run in the background and will remind you to take your mask whenever you leave that location! (and also reminds you to take necessary precautions).

The app is currently open to public testing and is 100% free, no ads, completely open source and no BS whatsoever :)

[wearAmask on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hudzah.wearamask) and also for anyone that wants to check out the code, it's on [GitHub here](https://github.com/HudZah/wearAmask)

Oh and I also posted this on [r/androidapps](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/) but wanted more technical advice and suggestions based of the code itself. 

Would really love to hear feedback from you guys! Any code improvements, suggestions and bugs would be really helpful!

Also [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM2rMe_WCas) a cool promo video I made for the app if you'd like to have a look!

## [8][Fragment blink](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j0pfk7/fragment_blink/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j0pfk7/fragment_blink/
---
I'm having a problem when I try to show a fragment from an activity. The fragment is showing well, but with a blink effect. I could see the blink effect is because it's showing the fragment and then it's showing it with the transition I set it up before on the activity, it's too fast but I can appreciate it. Is there a way to fix this problem?
## [9][How controversial would it be to have a mobile game that has a person as app icon, but the race of this person being localized for different languages?

Google allows you to localize app icon based on language - what if you localized the race of the person in the app icon based on the majority race that speaks that language?

Would this be controversial? If data confirms that Asian market would click more on the app icon if it showed a person of their race, as opposed to a race that doesn't speak their language, would there be anything wrong with moving forward with such localization?

Android studio quickly becomes unusable for me. I don't even have many things in my simple project, it was just started and only has about 3 very simple fragments working now. 
I built and ran the project three times now on a physical device and as you can see the whole ram has been filled.

I even switched over to a jdk that uses open j9 thinking it would reduce memory consumption but nope.

Attaching images since I have no idea how to get a text from this:

(No other apps were running on the system, it was just Android Studio)

Hi,

I had formatted sd card as internal/adoptable storage (ext4 file system format I guess) about a week ago. It was working fine except sometimes it got stuck and I had to reboot the phone and the card storage would work fine again.

Now the sd card has stopped showing in storage settings and phone's internal storage is also not showing in file mangager. all of my apps are stuck and I am unable to recover data from sd card or access my phone's internal storage. I have tried restarting phones and put the card into other phones but it just won't show up in storage or anywhere else. Even using list-disks and list-volumes commands in adb shell won't show any result. Please help as I have very important data in that card.
Regards
## [12][Removing your name from google searches](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j078v5/removing_your_name_from_google_searches/)

I've just realized that googling my name, even in part, shows my apps on g-play which shows my current residence. After contacting support they refused to remove my address from search results (I'm a solo developer and don't have a studio/postal boxes are not accepted in the terms and conditions (to the best of my knowledge)). 

Has anyone managed to successfully remove their private info from search results?
