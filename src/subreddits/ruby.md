Ruby and Python are the two most popular programming languages. Both languages possess different philosophies, came around the mid-90s to address various needs in the programming community. They’re both flexible, object-oriented languages, dynamic, and have a lot of different functionalities, required to empower web development.

Both frameworks provide views, controllers, and models to power your web application and an API that offers endpoints to address your needs.

When you are planning your new web development project this 2020, choose a framework that can provide every tool you need. And both Ruby and Python seem to be the perfect answer to these specific web development needs.

#  In Conclusion

After doing this Ruby Vs Python comparison, one thing is clear that both are equally capable, which language is better for your project, that is the main deciding factor ultimately. In fact, many of the changes and new features in Python are first tested in Ruby.

If you are looking at only building web applications, then consider Ruby on Rails. On the other hand, if you are interested in building web applications but would like to also learn a language that’s widely applicable and proficient with handling data analytics than Python is the best bet.

Also, when looking to add more features to your web application, like machine learning or other areas, Python is a perfect choice as it has libraries that support other fields.

Ruby focuses on giving developers the freedom to do whatever they want and staying out of their way, whereas Python developers are somewhat conservative and value stability over change. (developments and new features are slowly added)

Both Ruby and Python are fast and simple programming languages. For projects that include a lot of data computing, processing, and analytics, Python is probably the best option. However, Ruby suits projects that are traffic-heavy and involves rapid prototyping.
