I recently graduated with a degree in CS and have started applying for full-time positions. Got through an HR interview at a small company and have now been assigned a coding assessment (which I am almost done with). In the meantime, they have scheduled me for an interview with two lead UI/UX designers at the company. Having applied for a front-end engineering position, I fully expected to be interviewed by the lead developers but not lead UI/UX designers. And since I don't have a formal background in design, I am panicking about the interview. I would sincerely appreciate any advice on questions I can expect, things I should glance through, or just anything in general regarding interviews with designers. Thank you.
