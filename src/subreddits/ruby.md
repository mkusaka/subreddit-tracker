Hello all,

I've been learning the basics for ruby and gosu for the past few weeks and I'd like to try and create some form of application that can be used. Does anyone have suggestions for apps that can be made for beginners?

Are there comprehensive guides to using Ruby in "raw" form? I may just be missing something very obvious, especially since this is just a hobby for me. Everything I seem to find is full of sugar, and I admittedly dislike using it. I tend to enjoy languages such as Ada, that don't use much of that sort of thing. I enjoy writing Ruby, I just also like my code to be written in "longhand" form so I fully understand what is going on.

Do you have any useful plugins or suggestions on how to do it? Ideally I would probably want to auto-format whole file, but the tools to do so are not quire there yet. At the moment pasting some nested structures from console to test files is quite a pain.

`return`s in setters are omitted by Ruby:

```ruby
class Coordinates
  def x=(value)
    return 42
  end
end

Coordinates.new.x = 84 # =&gt; 84
```

Feel free to visit this [blogpost](https://medium.com/rubycademy/the-return-keyword-in-ruby-df0a7f578fcb) to learn more about the `return` keyword in Ruby

Hi Redditors, I expect this will be working as I connect to their API keys but there is no update received. I think api key hasn't been connected... but What have I done wrong?

&lt;code&gt;  


`require 'sinatra'`

`require 'stripe'`

&amp;#x200B;

`Stripe.api_key = ENV['rk_test_Hiia....']`

`endpoint_secret = ENV['sk_test_WUkA....']`

&amp;#x200B;

`Stripe::WebhookEndpoint.create({`

`url: '`[`https://example.com/test`](https://example.com/test)`',`

`enabled_events: [`

`'charge.succeeded',`

`],`

`})`

&amp;#x200B;
