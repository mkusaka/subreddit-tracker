We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I learned React a few months ago and I'm just a beginner. This is my first actual project without following any tutorial and boy was this tough. I had to google even the most basic stuff which I thought I knew. I know it's not great and any feedback would be appreciated. I tried to make it responsive too as much as I could. Here's the link to the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad/personal-website-builder](https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad/personal-website-builder)  
I'm welcome to any suggestions you guys might have.

My previous personal website wasn't very mobile friendly and relied on a third party library. I decided to spend a bit of time rewriting my command prompt / terminal inspired website from scratch using React and TypeScript.

There's definitely room for improvement, but I'm pretty happy with the results so far and it was a fun project to work on.

## [8][Comparing the Blazor to React](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gqwvr3/comparing_the_blazor_to_react/)

Hi all. I'm a Python/Django and Unity C# programmer. I'm looking to get into modern web/native app development (for non-games). Blazor is attractive for me because of C#/.NET. However, I recognize that Blazor is very new -- it just had it's first official release last week -- so has all the risks of a very new technology. So I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons very carefully before diving into a new project.

In particular, I see how mature and mainstream the React ecosystem is. So I wanted to ask how Blazor (referring to the whole ecosystem) looks to you React experts? Do you see Blazor as being a a real contender in the space now or later? Pros and cons versus React?

Thanks for any insights you can offer!
## [9][How to properly structure React with Redux](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gqwayi/how_to_properly_structure_react_with_redux/)

Hey!

So I've been going thru some of my old code and I'm starting to realize that the way I'm currently implementing redux isn't scaling well, and causing lots of confusion for myself. 

[Repo of a project that uses redux](https://github.com/donnyroufs/Lorax/tree/master/client/src/redux)

\[My first react project from ages ago(private repo)\](  ðŸ“·  
[https://gyazo.com/af697e8ad1d3c93d8d9a809ce8859834](https://gyazo.com/af697e8ad1d3c93d8d9a809ce8859834)  )

There are two specific points that confuse me;

* What belongs in my Reducer state? (not asking whether it should be global or not)

Let's say I have a TodosReducer, and on fetch I want to set a loading state; do I define my state like:

    const initialState = { 
        todos: [],    
        loading: true,
    }

Or do I keep loading seperate and initialState becomes my array of todos? 

Which gets me to my second point.

&amp;#x200B;

* Should you use Redux middleware in order to split actions?

I got this idea from [a talk by Nir Kuafman in begin 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUuic7mEs-s)

[My implementation based on the talk and his code examples](https://github.com/donnyroufs/redux-reddit/tree/master/src/redux)

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers,

A fellow developer.
## [10][useEffect unable to run window.scrollTo](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gqw8hp/useeffect_unable_to_run_windowscrollto/)

I have a parent component A with B, C and D as children.

I'm making changes in D component (a section before my footer)  and every time I save it and view the webpage, it renders and still shows the d section of the webpage whereas I expect it to render and show it from page start.

I have written window.scrollTo(0,0) in my useEffect in A component (using this as a componentDidMount).

I'm stuck on this for two days and unable to figure out what is wrong.

Can anyone help me on the alternate approach of fix for this?

TIA

I started learning React js about a month ago after learning basics of Javascript and created this simple covid 19 tracker app yesterday.

This is the first project I ever did with React. Here's the [link](https://corona-tracker-dash.netlify.app/) to the project.
