Hello :)

I'm trying to wrap my head around what the best approach for organizing code in a monorepo is.

Let's  say I have a \`landing-page\`, \`app\`, and \`blog\` folders which all  contain code for the respective sites. I also have a \`common\` folder  where I put utilities which I use across all the three sites.

My  current approach is that I use expressions like \`import {formatDate}  from 'common/date'\` to import code from the \`common\` folder into the  \`landing-page\`, \`app\`, or \`blog\` directories. (I use Webpack aliases to  be able to use \`import ... from 'common/date\` rather than \`import ...  from '../../../common'\`

I'd like  to know, however, what benefits would using a tool like Yarn Workspaces  bring? In what way it is better to turn my \`landing-page\`, \`app\`,  \`blog\`, and \`common\` folders into "installable" npm packages which I  would import from each other?

To  me, it seems like a lot more boilerplate than my current approach and I  don't see the benefit of using it. However, it's possible that something  just didn't click with me as for why I should use Yarn Workspaces. So  I'd love to hear from you.
