This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

My question is directed to people who develop AOSP apps, probably most of them work in Google.

What tools do you use to develop system apps like SystemUI or ThemePicker?

It's  a pain to port each and every application to Gradle in order to make it  indexable by IntelliJ IDEA/AndroidStudio so I figure there has to be  another way around. Do you use some plugin that supports  Android.bp/Android.mk?

Hi,

On the 2nd of August,  I published a small update to my existing app. Normally, review times are usually 12h (in April, May, and June) , I also have experienced up to 3 days, but my update is in review since 14 days. I'm an indie developer with 5M+ downloads.

 I also never got any information regarding the status of the update from Google Play. Does anyone have similar long wait times and what could be the reason for this?

Seems that (without special actions), apps won't be able to let users pick which camera app to use for taking a photo/video...

Only the built-in apps will be offered, and if they are disabled, the app will crash. Not only that, but it affects all apps, and not just apps that target API 30 and above...

As far as I know, trying to use EXTRA\_INITIAL\_INTENTS can only offer 2 more items, and even Google fails to handle it properly (example [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/162810356)).

Please consider starring [this request](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/164794531), to allow users to have the choice of which camera app to use.

I'd like to know what you guys think about this here, of course.

Can someone share any good resources that they find useful for preparing for Android related interviews.  
Something like a list to brush up your concepts, considering there is too much ground to cover.
