Not sure what's the reason, but I started to get some strange behavior from the Ruby console on production.

Every time I press backspace, instead of deleting the character it goes one space/blank forwards, this makes is super impractical.

For ex if i type "Company.find(12"

and I want to delete "12" by pressing backspace twice, i get this:"Company.find(12  "

What can cause this?Btw, i tried with multiple shells, restarted app, same thing.

Thanks

I'd like to know if there is a method/gem/script that allows automating the validate the compatibility of gems when upgrading **ruby from v2.0.0-p247 to v2.4.6**. I have run the **bundle install** which made me update a few of them and also, I ran my tests with rake and all are OK, but I'm not so sure if I can get further issues down the road.  


Any help will be appreciated.

I can't get `rails new blog` to work. I have all the permissions. Removing --pretend flag isn't working as expected.
