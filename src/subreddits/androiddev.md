* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi guys,

came here to ask for some help to the most experienced developers.

I'm currently building a trivia multiplayer Android game. I have my backend in Java Spring that handles all the status in every party the players are. So, the way im sending the data back to the clients is using a MQTT service, Firebase and Pushy, but they are giving me too many problems. Sometimes the notifications are too slow and sometimes they dont even arrive to the client. It is so much inconsistent.

I thought about using a websocket structure instead but, ain't that too much of an overkill? This game is not a shoother or a fighting game where latency needs to be the lowest possible, players just select an option and when they all are ready, the next question comes to their screens.

Is there something I'm doing wrong with Firebase or Pushy or do I need to rely in something better?

Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone,

I am looking for a Kalman Filter that fuses first acc and gyro data, and later on magnotometer data.

I think I understand the underlying principles of the Kalman Filter in general, but somehow I can't seem to make it work in Android Studio.  
There are many tutorials on how to implement such a filter but I found none specifically for Android.  
Since I'm stuck and I need a Kalman Filter Implementation of Orientation Estimate, this subreddit is my last resort.  
Does anyone know where to find the source code for my problem?  
Kind regards
## [9][Is it possible to open a shared google maps location on your own app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/htyust/is_it_possible_to_open_a_shared_google_maps/)

I hope I'm not breaking #2, but I'm not soliciting how to do it - but more whether its possible or not so I don't waste my time.  
Someone shared me a location on whatsapp, I want to open it with my app and extract the latitude and longitude. I'm getting that you'd deep filter it (i'm using Java), but I can't seem to get it to choose anything other than google maps.  


Is this possible?

## [12][How to remove padding at the bottom and right from WebView](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/htxn99/how_to_remove_padding_at_the_bottom_and_right/)

I am using SVG into WebView and having few interactions. Below is the code

`var pageText = "&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n" + "&lt;html&gt;" + "&lt;head&gt;" + "&lt;meta name='viewport' content='target-densityDpi=device-dpi'/&gt;" + "&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;\n" + "html, body { padding:0px; margin:0px; background:blue; border: 1px solid orange;}" + ".container{width:100%; height:100%; background:red; }" + "&lt;/style&gt;\n" + "&lt;script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;" + "&lt;/head&gt;" + "&lt;body style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px"&gt;" + "&lt;div id="div" class="container"&gt;" + svgString.trim() + "&lt;/div&gt;" + "&lt;script src="my_js_to_handle_interaction.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;" + "&lt;/body&gt;" + "&lt;/html&gt;"`

But on zooming, I can see there is some extra space after SVG at the right side and bottom of WebView. And this is being increased by some ratio, depending on zoom-in level.

I am unable to find the root cause of the issue.
