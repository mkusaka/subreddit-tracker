Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a recursive function in the link above. I am supposed to use that function inside another function. I tried to make it a lambda function but i couldn't. How can i use this recursive function inside another function?

I am learning C++ before my university starts next year, i will be using my Macbook Pro in University. I want to get used to the environment in my Macbook Pro and see how things work around there. I also want to do CP(Competitive Programming) from what I have seen almost all of Competitive Programmers use Windows/Ubuntu, i have seen some of them talking about code errors with submission on the server. So, it will help a bunch if you guys could tell me that should I use windows/ubuntu on my gaming pc or use my macbook?

I also have a high-end PC and both of my Macbook Pro and PC's spec are mentioned down below if that helps in any kind of way.

Macbook Pro 2019 - 16 Inches i7 6–core, 8th generation i think or either 10th, with 16GB DDR4 and 500GB NVME SSD

Gaming PC: i9–9900K, 32GB DDR4 3200MHz, 2080-Ti, RM 750x with NZXT H700 casing. 500GB NVME m.2 x 2 SSD’s/500GB SSD SATA III x 2 / 3TB HDD. 

I love MacOS a lot but i don’t want to have issues with CP, GUI-Applications and learning the programming language just because of the OS.

Any guidance would be appreciate and for those who code on MacOS, i know it being Unix based helps a lot with making development easier but is it the same for C++? Sorry if this is a dumb question but it would be appreciated if any help was provided regarding this so i can start studying C++.

What do you dislike of existing build systems? 


What would you improve?


What would you like to have in a build system that isn't there right now?

Sharing a project I created to help with writing tests. 
I have found that instantiating objects can be the most verbose part of writing test code (especially when dealing with large nested structures).

Individual tests don't need specific values for every field. I use this library to help generate them. If I do require specific values I can override them after creation. This can also help with readability by removing random variables that only exist so that an object can be created.

(Not sure if something like this already exists).
