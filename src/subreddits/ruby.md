New rails tech is coming around and new big projects are launched on rails (like basecamp has released the new awesome [hey.com](https://hey.com) email platform running on rails without any major JS frameworks).

Chris Oliver from gorails discussed it in the [freshest remote ruby podcast](https://remoteruby.transistor.fm/83) and said...

&gt;"It feels good to be in Rails right now"

Do you share this feeling?

Hi all,

Newbie at Ruby here, created a small script to do some media conversion to allow my TV to play the media files. Most of it I'm ok with apart from the new\_filename creation, is there a cleaner way to split the pathname down multiple times?

Also any general feedback on construction would be appreciated as well.

&amp;#x200B;

    # frozen_string_literal: true
    
    require 'pathname'
    require 'streamio-ffmpeg'
    require 'slop'
    
    # Set path to recursively search directories
    opts = Slop.parse do |o|
      o.string '-d', '--directory', 'a directory to search'
      o.on '-h', '--help' do
        puts "Usage: ruby Check-MediaFiles.rb '/enter/path/to/search/'"
        exit
      end
    end
    
    path = opts[:directory]
    
    # Search all subdirectories for mp4 and mkv files to process and begin loop
    Pathname.glob(path + '/*/*.{mp4,mkv,avi}').each do |file|
      # Change to each directory
      Dir.chdir(file.dirname)
    
      # Instantiate movie object for processing
      media = FFMPEG::Movie.new(file.to_s)
    
      # Create new filename from metadata
      temp1_filename = file.basename.to_s
      temp2_filename = temp1_filename.split('/')[-1]
      temp3_filename = temp2_filename.split('.')[0]
      new_filename = temp3_filename + '.mp4'
    
      # Check got ac3 audio in media file and convert if not found.
      if file.extname == '.avi'
        puts 'AVI detected. Re-encoding to mp4 for compatibility with Samsung TV.'
        media.transcode(new_filename.to_s, %W[-c:v copy -c:a ac3])
        File.delete(file)
        next
      elsif media.audio_codec != 'ac3'
        puts "AC3 audio codec not detected on #{file.basename} converting audio to AC3."
        media.transcode(new_filename.to_s, %w[-c:v copy -c:a ac3])
        puts "Completed conversion to ac3 audio for #{new_filename}"
        File.delete(file)
      else
        puts "No conversion required for #{file.basename}"
      end
    end

I'm just getting started with programming, my current job is willing to pay for me to get a course or attend a conference. All though I'll probably would go for an interactive course so I can ask questions. Can I get some recommendations from the community? 

I like to learn the following:
Ruby 
Ruby on rails
SQL advance queries
ActiveRecord advance queries

I work with a lot of data so having a depth knowledge of the last two would be awesome. Thank you in advance!

I'm happy that I just published the first two chapters ofÂ **API-only**Â ruby on rails course that IÂ [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gpebe0/im_planning_to_build_a_rails_course_would_you/)Â almost one month ago on this subreddit. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

In this course, we will build a functional clone ofÂ InstapaperÂ from scratch. Also, it targets the developers already familiar with rails tech stack and has a written format. It's an ongoing course, and I'm planning to share new chapters weekly basis.

You can reach the content fromÂ [https://duetcode.io/rails-api-only-course](https://duetcode.io/rails-api-only-course). Even though it's just two chapters, I wanted to share as early as possible to get some insights and feedback from the audience.

Please, let me know if you have any thoughts/feedback about the content or the website in general.

Knowing what your objects "exactly" do can be hard when debugging a ruby program. Either using \`puts\` or debuggers requires you to jump between files and insert debugging code everywhere.

That's why I created a gem called [tapping\_device](https://github.com/st0012/tapping_device), which can track objects and print all the traces in a nice format with just 1 line of code.
