Hi everyone - termshark v2.1 is out now on github. Termshark is a terminal UI for tshark that tries to imitate Wireshark. It's written 100% in Go and because of that, termshark is only a single binary on each supported platform. New with this release are conversations by protocol, packet colors and capture file info. A shout-out to the terrific tcell (https://github.com/gdamore/tcell), a library for handling terminals, upon which termshark is constructed. Here's the website - https://termshark.io. I hope you find it useful!

Does anyone know any good tutorial/article on how to make a video streaming service like Netflix with gRPC and Go ?

I'm new to golang and am loving all the features so far, but I've run into a bit of a problem. I'm using the sqlx package to assist with querying a MySql database, and I'm trying to execute a query:

`var t MyStruct`

`_, err = s.db.NamedExec("REPLACE INTO mytable VALUES (:id, :date, ....)", t)`

I've added `db:` tags to the struct but the issue is that MyStruct is extremely long, about 50 fields and it seems ridiculous that I'll have to list off each of the tags in the values section of any such named query, is there a better way to do this?
