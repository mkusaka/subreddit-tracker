In Go, `regexp.Compile`(`MustCompile`) has heavy cost. therefore, each functions should be called only once at initialize.

I made an analyzer to confirm whether the conditions are met.

BufferKing records whatever is playing on your computer; it listens in on your favorite music players notifications to gather track meta data and create a local library.

This is still in somewhat early stages but thought Iâ€™d share anyways in case others want to comment, criticize or pitch in and help make BufferKing better!

 With OpenCV (C++) I would use imread(), imshow(), waitKey() . What is  the GO equivalent? 

I of course tried googling it and found the "image" package, but it only  loads the image and doesn't display it. Another option is to install  the GoCV package which is a real pain on Windows because of minGW (the  latest version doesn't have a bin folder). 

Is there a simpler solution?
