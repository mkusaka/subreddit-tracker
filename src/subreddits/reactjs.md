It says it‚Äôs not a secure site and it‚Äôs hard for some people to get to it I guess due to their computer blocking it or something? Is this because it‚Äôs http?

## [7][How is UI usually 'designed' in React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i5b5x6/how_is_ui_usually_designed_in_react/)

*TL;DR: what do you think / know is used often to design the UI in professional apps?*

For the past couple of months I've been working with, among others, React.  
I've been using mainly Material- and Semantic UI for designing my apps.

However, these are what they call CSS-in-JS solutions and there are obviously many more.  
Because of that, it leads me to believe that there is also not one common way to design apps in professional apps.

On the other hand I'm doubting whether React developers are generally considered to do the design of the UI or whether its common to have other people taking care of making things look polished.

However, from your experience: **what do you think / know is used often to design the UI in professional apps?**

If you want to use something like Ant design, but feel unsure since it‚Äôs Alibaba building it, you should probably take a look at [Basikit](www.basikit.com).

I built and open sourced a Yeoman Generator for new React + JavaScript / TypeScript templates here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-react-scaffolder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-react-scaffolder)

Check it out and feel free to ask any questions.  Any and all feedback welcome!

(note: generated templates were built with Node 14.x in mind, but you *should* have success dropping that down to 12.x)
