Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

## [4][An Assembly interpreter written in C++](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jrq1jl/an_assembly_interpreter_written_in_c/)

Hey everyone!

Yesterday I made this little assembly interpreter. My reasoning for it was this: Assembly, while fun, is really annoying to setup! This interpreter aims to resolve this issue. All it needs is a C++ compiler, and it’s ready. 

The main aim is for learners to get comfortable with assembly syntax, without having to go through the pain of setting up. This interpreter supports basic assembly commands, and after every command you get to see the bits and values of every “register”. 

This interpreter is not: an emulator or an assembler. It is really just a way to practice some basic assembly syntax and see the results. 

Hope this helps someone! I’d love to hear y’all’s thoughts!

Hi!

Lately, I have been working on [Butano](https://github.com/GValiente/butano), a C++20 engine for the Game Boy Advance.

It brings its own standard library, based on the awesome [ETL](https://www.etlcpp.com/). It differs from the standard library mostly in the usage of asserts instead of exceptions and in the usage of fixed size stack buffers instead of the heap.

Since the GBA doesn't have a file system, all data has to be compiled into the ROM, which allows constexpr to be used with ease. Butano brings its own [asserts system](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/group__assert.html) which can be used in constant-evaluated contexts too thanks to [std::is\_constant\_evaluated](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_constant_evaluated).

The engine provides detailed [documentation](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/), multiple [examples](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/examples.html) of most aspects of the engine an even the source code and assets of a full game: [Butano Fighter](https://gvaliente.itch.io/butano-fighter).

If you have time please tell me what you think. Thanks!

Hi ALL. The title says it. I am a student of data structures and now I am supposed to complete an end of semester project. I don't like the ideas our instructor has suggested and I'm looking for something which is a bit more 'real- world'. Can you suggest some intermediate projects which would be sensible for C++.

Some time ago I was looking for a library which would let me use GitHub's API.  
I could not find any so I wrote my own. Today I have decided to extract it from my project and make it easily reusable so here it is:

[https://github.com/Kicer86/github\_api](https://github.com/Kicer86/github_api)

It's api is very limited. I have just covered my needs, but it can be easily extended.  
I hope you find it useful.

I am just posting this for discussion. I code in c++ using the llvm/clang + lldb for debugging with vscode as an editor. I am just wondering how soon the apps can run everything natively. 

If I am not wrong, the electron framework has to first work on Apple Silicon and then vscode will be ported. 

I think apple has already ported the llvm software to work on apple silicon.

I am just wondering how command line apps like vim, emacs , and also package managers like home brew will work. Does the emulation layer (Rosetta) work for these apps too? 

Just want to hear some of your thoughts and whether if anyone if planning to try the new ARM MacBooks.


Edit: 

Vscode beta is apparently coming for arm macs by November end https://twitter.com/code/status/1326237772860981249?s=21
## [11][Yet another Json library [beginner friendly]](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jrr2lq/yet_another_json_library_beginner_friendly/)

I always thought that, even with nlohmanns solution, working with Json in C++ is quite cumbersome.

So i made my own json library.  ~~With blackjack and hookers~~.

It is beginner focused but don't mistake that for "not powerful" because it is. It can handle every type of json (with one exception\*)

You can dirty-code something to work within 4 lines of code, or error-check the living hell out of it. Up to you!

I put a lot of time into an extensive [documentation](https://leonetienne.github.io/JasonPP/) with a lot of examples.

Do note that performance and memory efficiency was not the design goal of this. The design goal was ease of use.

Check it out here: [Github](https://github.com/Leonetienne/JasonPP)  
And here: [Documentation](https://leonetienne.github.io/JasonPP/)  
Download here: [Github/INCLUDE/Release](https://github.com/Leonetienne/JasonPP/tree/master/INCLUDE/release)

Since it is licensed under the MIT license you can use it in every project even commercially.

&amp;#x200B;

# Easy to include

It's one of these libraries that uses **ONE** .hpp and **ONE** .cpp file.

So two files in total.

No linking libraries because, duh, it is supposed to be beginner friendly. Linking (the right) libraries on Windows reeks. Especially for beginners.

&amp;#x200B;

# Quick example on how to read this json into a vector:

    // json
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]

&amp;#x200B;

    // C++
    Json json;
    json.Parse(myJsonString);
    
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; json.AsArray.Size(); i++)
       vec.push_back(json.AsArray[i]);
    
    // That's it

All this simple syntax and yet it still supports UTF-16 ;)

&amp;#x200B;

This started more or less as a fun sideproject but it is in a quite useable state now so i thought i'd publish it. Why not. :)

\*apparently json officially supports if-conditions and stuff. This sort of logic is not supported. Only data storage.
