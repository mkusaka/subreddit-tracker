**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I have a question for you: If you have decided not to use any of Boost, or are prohibited from doing so in your company/project, I would like to know why.

This thread is not meant to judge your reasons, and I won't engage into any kind of criticism about them: I'm merely trying to understand what the barriers are to adoption of Boost. It would be great if we could keep the conversation non judgemental. Thank you!

Conflict of interest: I am a Boost author of three.

You may have noticed the ongoing discussion on [why people don't use Boost](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gfowpq/why_you_dont_use_boost/). Now for the opposite question.

I'm not asking why Boost is used because the answer is relatively uninformative: one uses a lib primarily because it provides the required functionality. But using Boost (or any other lib, for that matter) means a commitment to it for the duration of the project. So, the question is:

If you are using Boost in your project(s)/company, why have you/your company decided it is OK to commit to this long-term dependency?

I won't delve into commenting/criticizing your answers, it's info I'm looking for, particularly in comparison to the "negative" thread going on in parallel. Please keep the conversation neutral, thank you!

What could go wrong with `'auto'` and `'-&gt;'` notation as function return types like   
"`auto function() -&gt; void;`" over this "`void function();`".  


I'm using them in all places because this makes my function declarations left aligned, but facing lot of disapprobations.

Hi all,

Just wanted to spawn a little discussion here. I'm working with C++ purely on a hobby basis. Also I've been using TS and Kotlin for a while now. Professionally I've only worked with Java, C#, JS and a little Python. Recently I started trying out some alternatives to NetBeans for C++ development (because code assistance is a little buggy from time to time).

I'm accustomed to being able to declare variables and get suggestions for types, even though the type I want to use is not (yet) included in the current source file. As demonstrated here in NetBeans:

[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5260237/71239041-da26b580-2305-11ea-9c25-b93b3519f9a1.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5260237/71239041-da26b580-2305-11ea-9c25-b93b3519f9a1.png)

Anyways, in my voyage to test some other IDEs I gave VS Code a go, and saw that this was not a feature. I made a [suggestion to the VSCode C++ extension developers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/4776) that this feature should be implemented (as it is in NetBeans). I got the response that "it's not a feature in Visual Studio so probably not going to add it to Visual Studio Code". And honestly, I'm a little surprised to find out that (perhaps) **the** most popular C++ IDE doesn't have this feature. Then it dawned on me that maybe most C++ devs don't have and don't use this feature. I haven't tested CLion but working with other Jetbrains IDEs I'm going to assume it is a feature in CLion. Eclipse CDT? Probably yes.

I guess it could be **my** workflow that is flawed, but I can't stand the idea of not getting `mtype` suggested just because I didn't add `#include "mytype.h"` first. I **need** this feature in my IDE. Not just for C++, but for any language.

So I'm curios. Does your IDE suggest types that are not (yet) included in your source file? Wouldn't you like to have it do so? Do you think it's an unnecessary feature?
