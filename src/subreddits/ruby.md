A mersenne prime is a prime number where the prime number plus one is a power of two.
The code is working, but I suspect my power_of_two? helper method is preventing the code from running at a realistic speed. I've been trying to figure out a different way to approach that method. If I think of it as a folder that always divides by 2 I was thinking maybe it would work better recursively, but making a boolean recursive helper function is way over my head at the moment.

I've seen this question on a few other subreddits, so I thought i'd ask here. Apart from your main job or full time work, do you make any side income from Ruby? Even if it's only a small amount, I would love to hear about it. Come tell all!!
