I can't describe how horrible this experience was.  I am not looking forward to how much work I am going to have to do to get my money back.  This is not my first AWS certification (I have SA Pro and DevOps Pro), but is my first online exam.  The short version is: Don't take AWS exams via the Pearson Vue at home option, even if it is offered.  AWS should not be offering this option as I can attest it is a waste of time.  Ironically, AWS would have us use their services because of their high availability and scaling but apparently they don't ask their test partners to do the same!

It started off easy enough: I passed the initial 'checks' as it confirmed my internet speed, camera access, and microphone access.  I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.  I tried again, and then a third time.  Same experience.  As I write this, I left it on that page and the spinning is continuing.  This screen has been spinning for no less than 45 minutes.  At 8 minutes before my scheduled exam, I tried finding the help link.  A chat window opened, and I waited, and waited, and waited.  Still waiting as I write this.  My chat window has been open for 52 minutes and still no one to help.  Every two minutes I get ' All agents are currently assisting others. Thank you for your patience.' written in the window.  OK - what next?  They make it harder to find, but I got a phone number I can call.  I tried calling that.  Busy signal.  For the next 20 minutes I called back and back, busy signal.  Finally, I got it to actually pick up, but of course no human yet.  No estimate of time to when I can be helped.  They don't even have nice elevator music to listen to.  Who knows when I will be able to talk to someone.  This has been an exceedingly poor experience.

If you value your time, please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt a online exam with Pearson.  I worked hard to prepare for this exam and rescheduled things to fit around it.  Now, I will have to do that all again.

u/jeffbarr Is this the experience AWS is hoping to get with their testing partners?  This was a waste of my time and money.  Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.

For what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.

*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.  I am actually quite surprised.

I wrote a free app for sketching cloud architecture diagrams. All AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud icons and more are preloaded in the app. Hope the community finds it useful: [cloudskew.com](https://www.cloudskew.com/)

Notes:

1. The app's just a simple diagram editor, it doesn't need access to any AWS, Azure, GCP accounts.
2. You can see some sample diagrams [here](https://www.cloudskew.com/docs/samples.html).

Would it be possible to run circa 10 Wordpress sites on the AWS EC2 Free Tier? 

The sites will receive extremely low traffic. 

I still haven't really wrapped my head around how the hours will be used or if it's even possible to keep the sites up for one year with the Free Tier.
## [5][help! 1M RPS ELB spike cost estimation](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hbxb8g/help_1m_rps_elb_spike_cost_estimation/)

hey, i'm starting to consider to switch to the cloud my side project, now, i found that ELB scales automatically without having the possibility to set a max number of connection per second.

in the event of a spike on traffic of  1 million request (let's say for an http flood attack) i would need 10\^6 connection/s which that means  (10\^6/25) LCU.

so the cost for that spike will be: (10\^6/25) \*0.008 = 320$ only in LCU, right?

it seems too expensive to me (for a side project) and i've no knowledge on how prevent this (cloudfront is not suitable for this). 

are my calculations right? 

there's a way to mitigate / prevent to ELB to scale to infinity or drop request(without paying for them)?

I'm processing a bunch of images which are stored on one of our servers through Lambda, not to DoS ourselves, this means that it is very likely that the Lambda is going to exceed 15 minutes.

Currently we already have a caching mechanism in place but I was wondering if Lambda has any way knowing its own execution time and gracefully terminate before it's timed out?

## [8][Elastic Beanstalk is wrongly deploying environment with Python 2.7 rather than 3.7](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hbylic/elastic_beanstalk_is_wrongly_deploying/)

After running \`eb init\` I chose an environment with Python 3.7 and AL 2. This is the config file that was generated:

    branch-defaults:
      default:
        environment: django-env
        group_suffix: null
    global:
      application_name: dashboard
      branch: null
      default_ec2_keyname: aws-eb
      default_platform: Python 3.7 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2
      default_region: us-west-2
      include_git_submodules: true
      instance_profile: null
      platform_name: null
      platform_version: null
      profile: eb-cli
      repository: null
      sc: null
      workspace_type: Application

So clearly I'm supposed to have python 3.7 in the EC 2 instance, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

When I SSH into the instance and run \`python\`, the instance's default is 2.7. What's wrong here?

Currently I have a lambda function that recycles ec2's in the ASG after they are more than a week old.  I remember seeing a press release or something that mentioned that sort of functionality was built into the infrastructure now but I can't find anything about it through google or the interface.  Is it possible or was I dreaming?
## [10][Lambdas - is there a better logical oranizational way to approach lambdas? I have too many...](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hbmqfl/lambdas_is_there_a_better_logical_oranizational/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hbmqfl/lambdas_is_there_a_better_logical_oranizational/
---
My team has deployed like 3 API Gateways, which all trigger some lambda or other, and we have additional test lambdas, and lambdas that do other things...

All in all we have 86 lambdas, 9 pages worth, and all different applications and projects and everything is just in one large list in the Lambda page.

Is there some sort of best-practice or some better way to organize them? I'm thinking like in ECS where you have like a logical cluster of containers/services/etc...

Any advice, I have to create 10 more lambdas for a new project and it just seems so disorganized.

Trying to deploy a django app which uses channels following this [https://medium.com/@elspanishgeek/how-to-deploy-django-channels-2-x-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk-8621771d4ff0](https://medium.com/@elspanishgeek/how-to-deploy-django-channels-2-x-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk-8621771d4ff0)

&amp;#x200B;

These are my config files:

**01\_env.config**

        option_settings:  
          aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:     
            WSGIPath: "dashboard/wsgi.py"
          aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
            DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: "dashboard.settings"
            PYTHONPATH: /opt/python/current/app/dashboard:$PYTHONPATH
        
          aws:elbv2:listener:80:

            Protocol: HTTP

**02\_setup.config**

        container_commands:
          00_pip_upgrade:
            command: "source /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install --upgrade pip"
            ignoreErrors: false
          01_migrate:
            command: "django-admin.py migrate"
            leader_only: true
          02_collectstatic:
            command: "django-admin.py collectstatic --noinput"
          03_wsgipass:
            command: 'echo "WSGIPassAuthorization On" &gt;&gt; ../wsgi.conf'

When I run \`eb create django-env\` it fails with 

\`Command failed on instance. An unexpected error has occurred \[ErrorCode: 0000000001\].\`

and in the logs, I found that the reason is:

&amp;#x200B;

2020-06-17 16:36:41,880 P4189 \[INFO\] Command 00\_pip\_upgrade

2020-06-17 16:36:41,883 P4189 \[INFO\] -----------------------Command Output-----------------------

2020-06-17 16:36:41,883 P4189 \[INFO\] 	/bin/sh: /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate: No such file or directory

&amp;#x200B;

So even though I'm following the guide, the directory seems to not exist. I'm also not being able to SSH into the EC2 instance to check this. Has the python venv directory in Amazon Linux 2 changed?
