Hi,

if  you are active in the SAP community and want to extend the existing standard monitoring options - here are two Prometheus exporters written  in Go:

1. [https://github.com/ulranh/hana\_sql\_exporter](https://github.com/ulranh/hana_sql_exporter)
2. [https://github.com/ulranh/sapnwrfc\_exporter](https://github.com/ulranh/sapnwrfc_exporter)

For an overview please have a look at the following blog post:

Hi, I'd like to design an app with a GUI but most of libraries seems hard or not convenant to my project. I tries Wails but I got stuck on file dialog which is bugged and there is also Fyne but there's almost no docs about designing (layout system, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was thinking about making an app that launch the console, this console stays open as "backend" and it opens a chrome window with a localhost web panel.  
The console actions are controlled from the web panel. With a sort of API that controls the backend.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you any ideas?
