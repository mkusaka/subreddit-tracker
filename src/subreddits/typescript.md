I'm trying to use React Router 5 path matches to set state. Trouble is something about the index signature is giving problems

    const backgrounds = {
      '/': nightPlanetBoat,
      '/portfolio': spaceGasClouds,
      '/about': spaceGasClouds
    }
    
    function App(props: any) {
      const [backgroundImage, setBackgroundImage] = useState(nightPlanetBoat);
    
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        console.log('props.location :&gt;&gt; ', props.location);
    
        setBackgroundImage(backgrounds[props.location.pathName as keyof typeof backgrounds]);
      }, [props.location.pathName]);
    
    /*
    /home/owner/cp/project/src/App.tsx
    TypeScript error in /home/owner/cp/project/src/App.tsx(46,24):
    Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string | number | symbol' can't be used to index type '{ '/': string; '/portfolio': string; '/about': string; }'.
      No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{ '/': string; '/portfolio': string; '/about': string; }'.  TS7053
    
        44 |     console.log('props.location :&gt;&gt; ', props.location);
        45 |     console.log('props.history', props.history)
      &gt; 46 |     setBackgroundImage(backgrounds[props.location.pathName as keyof typeof backgrounds]);
           |                        ^
        47 |   }, [props.location.pathName]);
        48 | 
        49 |   return (
    */

**Also tried**

* No type assertion. `as string`. `as const`. None of these fixed the index signature problem

Before writing the interface below for a React functiom component, the top function had no matching overload on `OuterContainer` for property `backgroundImage`. The bottom function, returned from the styled method, also had no reference to `props.backgroundImage` either.

So it really looks like the interface `ExtraContainerProps`, being passed as a type argument to `styled` as it is being invoked, extends the returned object's type definition. Is that what's happening?

    const ContainerStateInjector = (props: any) =&gt; {
      const [backgroundImage, setBackgroundImage] = useState(nightPlanetBoat);
    
      return (
        &lt;OuterContainer backgroundImage={backgroundImage}&gt;
          { props.children }
        &lt;/OuterContainer&gt;
      )
    }
    
    interface ExtraContainerProps {
      backgroundImage: string;
    }
    
    const OuterContainer = styled.div&lt;ExtraContainerProps&gt;`
      background-image: url(${props =&gt; props.backgroundImage});
      background-position: center;

I haven't used interfaces much in this pattern, I usually use them as annotations or type arguments on function declarations, so this broadens my understanding of their use cases.

Wondering what is better in terms of performance and project reference support:

1. Compilation done by `tsc -b -w` only; `webpack` and `webpack-dev-server` only bundle already compiled `js` files and only frontend code

2. `webpack` + `ts-loader` for frontend code

    const foo: string | undefined = "";
    // TS ignores the type annotation and decides the type is `string`.
    foo.toUpperCase();
    
    const bar: string | undefined = Math.random() &gt; 0 ? "" : undefined;
    // tsc error as expected
    bar.toUpperCase();

Is this new or has this always been the case? Is this documented anywhere? Is it a bug?

Are there any style guidelines, projects to look at, or best practices available on how to use typescript?  
Currently I am bit of a loss on how I should structure the project I am working on.

Do all the type declarations belong at the beginning of the file? Do I put the into a separate declaration file? Do I spread them out across the source file? How about naming convention?

Tutorials usually cover how to use the language but I haven't found a style which feels organized. e.g. the types packages all look vastly different and some of them are just incomprehensible at first glance.
## [8][Narrowing strings to keys of own type?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ifmrob/narrowing_strings_to_keys_of_own_type/)

I am designing a library with an API like this:

    let myThing = thing({
      identifier: ["name", "size", "foobarbaz"],
      properties: {
        name: { type: String },
        size: { type: Number },
        color: { type: Color },
        text: { type: String }
      }
    });

It basically means that you create a kind of thing with these properties, and properties "name" and "size" identify it unambiguously.

I want it to be impossible to mention a field inside `identifier` which is not a part of `properties`. So the example above should show an error at `"foobarbaz"`, which is not a valid property name. My attempt looks like this:

    function thing&lt;TProp extends string, T extends {
        identifier: TProp[],
        properties: { [key in TProp]: any }
    }&gt;(data: T): T {
        return data;
    }

However, this doesn't work. I assume that TypeScript reads the `identifier` first and assumes that whatever is written there is a part of `TProp` and therefore valid. What can I do to make it show an error in my example?

To clarify, I want the type to be inferred completely, without requiring the user to provide the type themselves.

Thanks!
## [9][rxjs filter pipe doesn't narrow type?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ifklp4/rxjs_filter_pipe_doesnt_narrow_type/)

Consider this example:

`const source$ = of(5, 'abc');`  
`source$.pipe(filter(val =&gt; typeof val === 'string')).subscribe(val =&gt; {`  
 `// val: string | number;`  
`});`

Why doesn't the filter pipe here narrow down the type to only string? Is there a rxjs operator that could do the filtering?

Thanks

## [11][How can I extend an interface with increased specificity for a type?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/if7ytw/how_can_i_extend_an_interface_with_increased/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/if7ytw/how_can_i_extend_an_interface_with_increased/
---
Say I have the following "generic" interface that defines props for a component:

```
export type MyType = string | number;

export interface BaseProps {
    ...
    onChange: (newValue: MyType) =&gt; void;
}
```

Now what I'd like to do is write an interface that extends this, but specifies which of the two values is actually going to be used. The type used depends on the component. Both are never valid at the same time.

```
interface Props extends BaseProps {
    ...
    onChange: (newValue: string) =&gt; void;
}
```

This does not work, with the error that "string is not assignable to number", which makes sense. I understand that this isn't a correct usage of TS types. 

However, is there a way to do what I want here? I could just slap an `any` in `BaseProps` but I like that `MyType` clearly defines what `onChange` will actually do. Otherwise you'd have to go find where it's extended to understand what kind of values it uses.

It would also be nice so that I could ensure I wasn't using a type that the base did not allow. For example: 

```
interface Props extends BaseProps {
    ...
    onChange: (newValue: boolean) =&gt; void;
}
```

Having this be rejected would be quite convenient. 

I'd like to declare at a high level all possible options and gain specificity as I go deeper down, if that makes sense.
