Just spent some time trying to figure out some very unexpected behavior. A simplified version is available on playground [https://play.golang.org/p/SxK\_XO-NvM1](https://play.golang.org/p/SxK_XO-NvM1)

    package main
    
    import (
    	"fmt"
    	"strconv"
    )
    
    func add(w int) int {
    	return w + 1
    }
    
    func doStuff(w int) {
    	fmt.Println(strconv.Itoa(w))
    }
    
    func main() {
    	i := 5
    	if i == 3 {
    		doStuff(i)
    	}
    
    	for z := 0; z &lt; 4; z++ {
    		i := add(i)
    		doStuff(i)
    	}
    
    	doStuff(i)
    }

The error is an extra `:` present inside the forloop which creates a variable with the same name.

Is there any tool that warns about this?

We currently use golang.org/x/lint/golint, honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck and go vet but none of them complains. Or at least none of them complained about the more complex case.
