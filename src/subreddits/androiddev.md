This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Is it good practice to hardcoding width and height in ImageView? 

Like max/minWidth and max/minHeight not working in my case.   


`&lt;androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatImageView`  
 `android:id="@+id/imv_icon"`  
 `android:layout_width="wrap_content"`  
 `android:layout_height="wrap_content"`  
 `android:adjustViewBounds="true"`  
 `android:background="@drawable/background"`  
 `android:maxWidth="143dp"`  
 `android:maxHeight="143dp"`  
 `android:minWidth="143dp"`  
 `android:minHeight="143dp"`  
 `android:scaleType="fitXY"`  
 `tools:srcCompat="@drawable/icon" /&gt;`

Hey guys,

Our app, Deepstash ([cache link](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YhxxyuS9ERcJ:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.deepstash%26hl%3Den+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us))  was suspended from Play a few hours ago, because it apparently contains texts related to Covid-19.

Being suspended, we cannot update it so we have submitted an appeal.

Now I know some other users (like u/Smive) here have had issues in the past month with this and managed to get back from this.

Our app isn't a news app, nor do we engage in communicating specific Covid related news or information. It's possible that Play's algo classified us as fake news or similar.

Deepstash is a self-improvement app, where we curate articles on self-development from reputable authors all over the web and create ideas that our users use to better themselves and grow.

We pinged this subreddit while we were just starting out, months ago, and we have great feedback from users.

Our topics are about remote work or productivity or other support areas. It's clear that in recent months, some articles also mention the current pandemic amidst the good advices.

We don't share statistics on the pandemic nor are we "a tracker" or anything remotely similar. We also do not have any mention of Corona or Covid in any of our store listing.

The support from our users was awesome and we are close to 1M installs in Play, with a 4.8 steady rating (14k reviews).

Do you guys have any suggestions? 

We did contact some people at Google by mail and Twitter DMs, sent some tweets to our users that wanted to share the app but couldn't find it and removed any articles and ideas that mention any words sorrounding "corona" or "covid".

It's such a bummer and we're just scrambling to get ourselves back in Play.

my query looks like this: db.collection(*CONVERSATION\_REFERENCE*).whereEqualTo(*firstUser*, myUserId).whereEqualTo(*secondUser*, myUserId).get(). However my query only needs for one of the fields to be equal. Can you somehow do that in firebase without using 2 queries?

## [12][Noob question: Do I need a "real" app to get a simple widget?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gf2eld/noob_question_do_i_need_a_real_app_to_get_a/)

Hi folks

I'm not into android/mobile development, so sorry if this is extremely basic.

I want to get a widget on my screen that displays a couple of values retrieved by polling a specific URL every X minutes. There's nothing more than that really, except some formatting.

Question: whats the easiest way for me to accomplish this? I don't really want/need to get too much into android development, and this widget is just for my personal use so no problems with code quality, security, etc.

Thanks in advance for any advice!
