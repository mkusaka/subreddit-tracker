Recently I have found [this tutorial](https://www.2n.pl/blog/basics-of-curses-library-in-ruby-make-awesome-terminal-apps) which got me interested in learning the curses gem for Ruby. I have the following program:

    require "curses"
    include Curses
    
    puts has_colors?
    
    begin
        init_screen
        start_color
        noecho
        curs_set(0)
        init_pair(1, 1, 0)
    
        loop do
            attron(color_pair(1)) {stdscr &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!"}
            attroff(color_pair(1))
            refresh
            
            c = getch()
            case c
            when "q"
                break
            end
        end
    ensure
        close_screen
    end

The `init_pair(1, 1, 0)` function should setup a foreground/background pair of colors (I believe Red/Black) and then `attron(color_pair(1))` should pick the color I had set and use it for the printed message.

I've tried googling the issue as well as looking through the [docs](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/curses/rdoc/Curses.html) to try to find anything on the issue and I couldn't find anything. I tried using another window instead of the `stdscr` and set the color attribute that way and still got nothing.

I feel like I'm missing something incredibly simple but I just cannot find it. If anyone has used curses and would like to help I greatly appreciate it. If it matters I'm using windows and command prompt as the terminal. `has_colors?` returns true so it seems that I can use colors but I'm not sure how.

Any help would be appreciated.

I've been digging into Rust for an embedded project and found that there is a lot more container types available.  I see implementations for SwissTable and other containers, lots to choice from based on if you want constant-time lookups vs quick insertion.  I'm having a hard time finding different implementations of containers in Ruby. Do they exist?  Is it even possible?  I'd love to be able to pickup a Gem that implements different container types and choice the correct implementation based on my needs.

Hey guys, i created a single-video tutorial aiming for programmers to learn Ruby. 

This tutorial goes through implementing an actual program (sorting numbers with quicksort).

It would be nice to get some feedbacks, i have plans to create similar videos for other languages.
