**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

Reference: [https://github.com/jfixemer/string\_view-building-blocks](https://github.com/jfixemer/string_view-building-blocks)

The only way you learn is to try, and have your code torn to pieces (hopefully constructively). No obligation of course, but maybe it will inspire more C++ oriented replacements for things like expat.

I started with some code from simber on github and kind of liked how he made a tokenizer.  So I thought I would roll my own in a similar usage style for XML.

The goal was to have a SAX-ish type of interface but avoid anything that wouldn't swap assign (so no vectors of attributes), and use string\_view to move through the document.  I was partially inspired by the in-situ parsing of RapidXML, but wanted to avoid the custom objects and buffer manipulation they use to create null terminated strings directly in the buffer.

I won't claim it is apples to apples with expat / libXml2 / Xerces as it is more of a tokenizer than a SAX parser (ie. no interpretation of XML namespaces, doc references and definitely not validating -- not even matching start/end elements :-) )   The goal was to make it through a pre-validated XML document, but faster than expat.

Using some xmlbench material (namely the 11MB test.rdf file). I managed to get this comparison on my box:

    mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release ..; make performance\_xml
    time ./performance\_xml $XMLBENC/xml.files/test.rdf 
    SVBB XML-SAX took: 0.028743 seconds.  ## &lt; this is internal measurement, just around the parsing loop.
        
    real    0m0.062s  ## &lt; this is total execution time, including file=&gt;memory slurp.
    user    0m0.031s
    sys     0m0.031s

Now expat

    time parse/expat 1 xml.files/test.rdf 
    Initialisation time 0.039 + 16.889(0.00%) ms, Parsing Time 161.154(0.00%) ms
    
    real    0m0.378s
    user    0m0.313s
    sys     0m0.063s

So if you want to include some 'other manipulations' then 0.37 s vs 0.06 seconds (6x).

If you trust the internally reported times... then it looks like 0.16s vs 0.03s (5x).

YMMV and no I can't say that it has an 'excellent' test suite with tons of corner cases and other things that make it bullet proof (use RapidXML or Expat if that is needed) - it is just an experiment.

## [7][compound assignment to volatile is deprecated](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gqu02u/compound_assignment_to_volatile_is_deprecated/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gqu02u/compound_assignment_to_volatile_is_deprecated/
---
Working with a G++ 10 compiler (C++2x mode) on my embedded code I ran into this: a compound assignment to volatile is now deprecated. IMO this is a bad idea. Volatile might be a PITA in some situations, but it is INDISPENABLE for accessing memory-based peripherals. The setting or clearing of specific bits is a very common use case, typically something like this:

PIOA-&gt;PIO\_ABSR &amp;= \~PIO\_PA8; 

With the deprecation I'll have to rewrite such statements to

PIOA-&gt;PIO\_ABSR = PIOA-&gt;PIO\_ABSR &amp; \~PIO\_PA8;

which isn't friendly to the reader. Note that the lhs expression can get more complex. IMO this deprecation should be revoked (or at least not culminate in a removal from the language).

(PS: I am now struggling with a hosted gcc 10. Are there already any standalone (-none-) gcc 10 packages available?)

Is it only me or once the C++20 flag is enabled in CMakeLists.txt, the whole CLion starts being buggy?   
Working with MinGW on Windows. 

By buggy I mean that:  
\-&gt; random identifiers are being highlighted as if they were invalid/errorenous  
\-&gt; whole auto completion system becomes very delayed/laggy  


Everything compiles fine though...

I am currently working on a huge CMake-based C/C++ project that takes forever to build (especially linking is killing me), even though my laptop is pretty buff. So I thought I can boost my performance by building on something even more powerful, and rented a dedicated server.

Now I have everything to compile my project remotely, as it looks like it works a bit faster than on my local pc. So now I write code on my local machine, push changes to git, ssh to the server, fetch changes, build via terminal.

Big question: is there a way to simplify this workflow and retain the raw computing power of the remote server, whilst working from an IDE that renders eye-candy GUI on my local laptop? (yes, I've been living under a rock for a decade or so).

And just to clarify a bit, here is what I expect:

* Minimal set up on remote host (ideally just an SSH server)
* edit/navigate source code (fuzzy-finding methods, classes, callers, jumping in and out of callees)
* run build jobs
* debug stuff on a remote machine with the power of GDB
* Optionally: forward SSH-identity


I've already tried EMACS, but I must be too stoopid to set it up properly.

And I've tried VisualStudio Code, but I wasn't able to make it work 100% - debugging was not working, code navigation was off.



Would appreciate any help with this.
