We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Angular was the framework to go. Now, it's React. Redux was the go-to state management library. Now, there are some saying Context + Hooks is all you need while others say mobx is the way to go. 

Things evolve so fast in frontend development. How do you guys stay sane? Don't you feel FOMO (fear of missing out) whenever something new pops up? I feel frontend has become more complicated than backend in terms of the number of things that we need to learn in order to be valuable in the market. I literally feel like I'm running a marathon trying to learn everything and the goalpost keeps moving further and further.

Hi,

I recently started a new project with create react app, and I'm trying to use SC, TS and MaterialUI. I have worked with these before, but I'm facing some difficulties trying to get them set up.

I'm trying to create a custom button with the following:

    import styled from 'styled-components';
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import Button from '@material-ui/core'
    
    const ButtonStyle = styled.button`
    `;
    
    interface Props {
      buttonText: String
    }
    
    class CustomButton extends Component&lt;Props&gt; {
        render() {
          return (
          &lt;ButtonStyle
          &gt;&lt;/ButtonStyle&gt;
          )
        }
        
      }
      export default CustomButton;

While trying to pass in props to ButtonStyle, I attempt to do so:

    &lt;ButtonStyle
     buttonText="Hi!"&gt;&lt;/ButtonStyle&gt;

But I get a "no overload matches this call" error. 

I also attempt to use const ButtonStyle as styled.Button, but it says that it not exist on type 'ThemedStyledInterface&lt;DefaultTheme&gt;'.
