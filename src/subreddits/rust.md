Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

Hi, i'm new to Rust but not new to programming. I have recently wanted to start learning OpenGL but at the same time I want to learn Rust. Should i stick it out and do it this way or would it be better for me to learn OpenGL with another language that i'm a bit better with?

The best outcome for me here is that I use Rust.

If anyone has any tutorials or advice, it would be much appreciated.

I program on a Mac btw...

## [5][PSA: `deny(warnings)` is actively harmful](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f5xpib/psa_denywarnings_is_actively_harmful/)

Some crates like to use `#![deny(warnings)]` or `#![cfg_attr(test, deny(warnings)]` as a way of enforcing clean code. This is a lot like GCC's `-Werror` option, and a quick [search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=don't+use+"-Werror") can show a lot of reasons why that is harmful. It may be OK while you're actively maintaining your code, but once you're not paying attention, small signs of bit-rot like using deprecated APIs will turn into outright errors.

When used as a crate dependency, Cargo will mask this with `--cap-lints allow`/`warn`, so it's usually not the end of the world. However, when the Rust teams want to test the impact of a potentially breaking change, they run mass builds with Crater. If your crate is already failing due to `deny(warnings)`, then any future changes that really do break you won't be seen as a regression.

Case in point, [rust-mac#15](https://github.com/reem/rust-mac/issues/15), their `if_cfg!` macro is broken by the [changes to the `meta` matcher](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63674) in Rust 1.40. However, the crater run for that change showed 0 regressions, because `mac`'s tests were already broken by the simple deprecation of `...` in pattern matches.

I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, and I certainly don't mean to blame/shame anyone involved in that example. I just want to show this as a concrete way that `deny(warnings)` is actively harmful to the maintenance of the Rust ecosystem. For that matter, any wide net like `deny(deprecated)` would be just as bad. Please don't open yourself to build failures from stuff that should just be a warning!

R we web yet?
Is Rust good for backend?
Like APIs, etc.
Can someone recommend me something?
