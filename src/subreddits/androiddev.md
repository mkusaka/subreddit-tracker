* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Iâ€™ll be publishing my first app soon and I am still thinking about if I should monetize it.

I am not expecting many downloads so I am aware I am not making much money with it if I decide to monetize it, but Iâ€™d like to know from your experience, fellow developers, what have you learned with your apps regarding monetization?

Iâ€™ve been doing a little research on my own and found about Admob and Mopub, but I am still not sure which one would be better to use while getting started.

Also Iâ€™ve seen many people suggest using IAP instead because ad revenue tends to be much lower.

Would really appreciate your opinion/advise on this :)

I recently changed a lot in my app and because the approval takes days, I don't want to publish a new release without having it tested by multiple users. Is someone interested in it? I imagine I could also test others, so it like an exchange via apks. Please contact me via levion.software@gmail.com if you're interested ðŸ¤™

Last time I wrote a public-facing web front end was 10 years ago. At that time I used jQuery and the bootstrap CSS framework.

I know it's a total different world right now. And I'd like to know what's the state of the art as of today.


 I got used and now love the ConstraintLayout's way of building my UI. I'm scared to go back to editing CSS file and googling my way to know how to vertically center a div, like I used to do 10 years ago. Also, now everything has to be mobile-ready as well which wasn't the case back then.

As an Android dev, what's your way of designing beautiful web front ends?

Thanks for your help, I can't be the only one in that situation :)

## [9][Room advice: String or Char array?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g4qczf/room_advice_string_or_char_array/)

I've never used SQLite before, only MySQL/Maria &amp; Postgres. I'm trying to make a table with a two-letter country code in one column:

    data class Foo(
        @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
        val id: Long = 0L,
        val countryCode: String?,
        val somethingElse: Int?
    )

I should be using `CharArray(2),` like I would for a normal DB, right? That won't compile, unfortunately (*"Expecting comma or ')'*"). What's wrong with CharArray here, and how do I declare it in this example?

Do you first design the layout, then code, then polish etc?

On the official site it says " GNOME or KDE desktop. *Tested on gLinux based on Debian."*   
Can you guys tell me the best Linux distro for this?
