I downloaded it in order to try out Jetpack Compose but it keeps complaining:

&gt;**Compose feature not supported** Jetpack  Compose is a preview feature, and support for Compose is included only  in Canary versions of Android Studio. To use Compose in your app  project, download and install the latest Canary version of the IDE.

I also switched my update channel to Canary and "Invalidate cache &amp;  Restart" still no improvement. I can run the compose code on device but  Preview is not working. Any help?? :(

EDIT: I changed the compose library version to 0.1.0-dev05 and Compose Preview also started working.

## [11][Take screenshot of Frame layout](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f9sa39/take_screenshot_of_frame_layout/)

So i have 3 framelayout inside a parent linear layout. Inside each framelayout i have imageview. I want to provide user a button in each of these framelayout and when user presses corresponding button it will take screenshot of that corresponding image only. I.e 3 images will be in three layouts and if user presses middle button then only the image of second layout should be saved and not just the screen with all three of them.
Is this possible or what's the alternative way to do this?

Edit: i also have zoom gesture enabled in the imageview so if user is half zoomed-in to the image then half zoomed in image should be saved and not the whole unzoomed image.
## [12][Has anyone try to monetize app using adaptive banner? Does it work better than smart banner?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f9qnnw/has_anyone_try_to_monetize_app_using_adaptive/)

All the while, we are monetizing our app using Google AdMob smart banner.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, we were introduced with adaptive banner - [https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner/adaptive](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner/adaptive) 

&amp;#x200B;

Google claims adaptive banner will increase earning by 20%

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering, has anyone tried to migrate from AdMob smart banner to AdMob adaptive banner. Do you see a significant increase in term of earning?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.
