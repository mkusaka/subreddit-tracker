This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Following Brexit, Google are moving their UK users data or of the EU and into US servers, losing is the protections of GDPR. Can anyone tell me how to understand what information Google collects from an Android device, other than information which directly goes through their servers (like Gmail)? For example, can they see what users type in WhatsApp, or their browsing history in Opera, or their activities on Reddit?

## [9][Android studio: 32gb RAM vs 64gb RAM?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f6szgk/android_studio_32gb_ram_vs_64gb_ram/)

I'm getting a new computer and have the option of getting 32gb RAM or 64gb RAM. Has anyone done a comparison between the two, or optimized Android Studio to take advantage of a 64gb RAM computer?

My current 16gb RAM setup (2016 Macbook Pro, 16GB Ram, all specs maxed) takes about 15mins to do a clean build in Android Studio and memory is a clear bottleneck (constantly near 0% free if I run Android Studio and have a few tabs open in Chrome). My iMac has 24gb RAM and builds much faster because it doesn't bottleneck on memory.

can anybody help me?  I wanted to play a game that I recently played on my computer, but my computer broke down and I can't play it anymore.  It is a 2D pixelated platform game.  I just want someone to turn this .EXE game into an .APK to run on Android, the entire community of this game has always wanted an android version.  (Moderators are nice I'm just a desperate guy), if in this community it is not possible to make requests, tell me which subreddit I can make that request. Send me a private message if you're insterested on helping me and the android gaming community.
