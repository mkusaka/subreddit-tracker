## [2][Some interesting statistics from a go 1.2+ part-time programmer:](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/fa4by7/some_interesting_statistics_from_a_go_12_parttime/)

I just ran my entire codebase through some statistics and found it pretty interesting.  I started seriously around go 1.2 and haven't stopped.  Most of the code is not kept up-to-date and was mostly a one-off for the project at the time.

* Total *.go Files : 661
* Total non-empty Lines: 167357
* Average non-empty line length: 18
* Total non-duplicate lines 54552
* Highest count duplicated line: if err != nil:  6482
* func main() Count: 157
* Runtime: 9.300674602s


I've written "if err != nil" nearly 6,500 times!  This is on osx, opening and saving in memory every line of almost 700 files takes less than 10 seconds, pretty impressive.  This has not been optimized also.

Anyone know of some fancier tools to get stats like this with a large codebase?

Hi, I am using Go with Docker to write a web api and I am curious what do you guys suggest for live reloading the code on file change? I have tried some options like Air, but I can't get it to work with docker compose. Are there better solutions out there?

Will there be an official go standard gui framework? Like tkinter is for python.

Just released a beta version of a go mod dependency checker via terminal ui. Let me know what you think!
