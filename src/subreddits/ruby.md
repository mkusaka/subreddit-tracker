Hey...

[Datakick](https://www.datakick.org/) - an open database of barcode / product data - announced it was shutting down at the end of March. I managed to whip up a rough and ready replacement, using data from the original site. If anyone was using the [datakick](https://github.com/ankane/datakick) gem, you should find it will still work - at least in read-only mode - if you retarget the `master` branch version to point to the service running at https://www.brocade.io. 

The code for the service is open source: https://github.com/ferrisoxide/brocade.io

Eventually we'll roll out a more specific-use gem and add editing support back in. 

Right now I'm not looking a critique for the Brocade code. I know it's awful - it was written in a rush to get something up and running before Datakick disappeared. Having said that, if there's anyone else working on barcode / product data projects I'd be keen to connect and share ideas.

My First rubygem. Saved some time for me on routine action of downloading images for seeds.rb (RoR) (I don't like remote sources of images, because of internet connection can be slow or even off)
## [6][XSD to Ruby classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/fwh4ln/xsd_to_ruby_classes/)

Been trying to convert a stack of .xsd schemas to Ruby classes. There appears to have been some work in this area, way back when XML was king (\~10 years ago) but I can't find any gems or code that has been maintained over the years. I've searched github for ruby+xsd, tried installing and running what I found - slowly going insane as everything seems to be borked/undocumented/unsupported.

I note that there used to be support for XSD directly in the Ruby standard lib, circa v1.8.7, but since removed. Am I just barking up the wrong tree here? Should I just try to do this by hand, and not look for a pre-existing solution?

Hello,

Is there anything similar to [this](https://asciinema.org/a/136184) but for RSpec?
