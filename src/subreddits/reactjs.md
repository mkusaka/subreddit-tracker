I mean, you have to concatenate two .then() just to retrieve the message from the server. Am I doing anything wrong?  
this call for example:
    
            fetch('https://my-api/login', {
                method: 'POST',
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    name: data.name,
                    email: data.email,
                    password: data.password
                }),
                headers: {
                    "Content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
                }
            })
                .then(async (response) =&gt; {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw Error(await response.json());
             }
             return response.json();
            )
                .then(response =&gt; {
                    console.log(response);
                    cookie.save('token', response.token);
                    this.setState({
                        user: response
                    });
                    resolve('ok');
                })
                .catch(err =&gt; {
                    reject(err);

Hi guys, i'm trying to re-create this app as a learning guide.  
[https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton](https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton)

It  has the ability to sync the gists in the background but i have  no idea  how to do that. What's the concept behind that? Does it use websocket?  How do i know that there's new data to be synched?

Hope you can help me with some concepts that needs to be learned.

I have a project (made with react js and material ui) that is finished and works well on all browsers accept Internet explorer.. It is a requirement that it should be supported on IE and it was a shock when I knew that.. it's clear I didn't read the requirements well :/

I added some polyfill most of the pages are appearing accept one page.. 
Plus the Grids are collapsing on each other

Is there a quick way( a polly fill ) a magical spell to fix the issue other than redoing the whole pages again
