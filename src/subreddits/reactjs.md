## [3][[Show off] Second "full-stack" app - Roomie - Find a room to rent! Built with: React + TailwindCSS + Express + MongoDB + Heroku / S3](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/guembv/show_off_second_fullstack_app_roomie_find_a_room/)

Hey, devs!

I've been studying for a few months now and after one month and 25 deploys, this is my second full-stack project: Roomie - a website to find rooms to rent or to list your place. üòÖ

I created this for the sake of learning only and since my first full-stack project was a [simple CRUD app](https://appjournals.herokuapp.com/), it was a blast having this experience!

**demo:** [https://roomiew.herokuapp.com/](https://roomiew.herokuapp.com/)

**repo:** [https://github.com/lucasmrl/roomie](https://github.com/lucasmrl/roomie) (missing README)  


**Built with:**

* FE: React (Hooks, Context API, Router) + TailwindCSS
* BE: Node.js (Express.js) + MongoDB
* Hosted on Heroku / Images in AWS S3

**What I tried to learn:**

* Authentication (Sign up, Log in, Log out, Reset password)
* API Filtering, Sorting, Pagination (Even though it is not implemented in the FE)
* Send e-mails from back-end
* Upload pictures to S3
* Security
* TailwindCSS (first time using it)
* Agile methodology (tried to organize my user stories, sprints, daily stand-up meeting, ...)

Definitely it is far from perfect, but it helped me a least to get my hands dirty. I appreciate any feedback!

Be safe! ;)

I'm a relatively new to React and I've been working on my medium-large sized full-stack app in it. It's been really increasing in size and unfortunately my code is starting to look like a big pile of spaghetti. 

Does anyone have any tips or resources on how to structure a React project, or the best way to turn it into components, hooks etc? Every time I create a component or a hook I end up having to manage all the dozens of props that has to passed in... and it's just really not working out great. 

I would look at professional repos, but there's really not that many large-scale open-sourced React apps out there.

Hey guys,

I am trying to make my pwa close to full screen by hiding thr search and nav bar on mobile browsers (Safari and Chrome ) ,while scrolling. 
I have read that full screen API isn't available for, IOS devices but I see many sites on IOS doing this feature. 
Can anyone explain how this is done.

Hi there!

https://reddit.com/link/gukgly/video/vvvf69zuta251/player

I just built this Palette Generating tool for designers and developers in React.js. You pick 2 colors you like (i.e. Red and black) and the tool generates thousands of palettes for you. You can also download the palettes.

Hi all, 

I have started learning React recently and wants to make some open-source contribution, but when I browse through different repository available, it's gets overwhelming for me. I am looking for suggestion of repositories from regular contributors related to React. Please help this poor fellow, struggling for a long time.

Hoping for a positive response from the community.

Thanks.
## [12][Passing Arguments to Parent Component's Dispatch function from Child Component](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/guiam9/passing_arguments_to_parent_components_dispatch/)

Hey everyone, I'm still relatively new to React and could use some help. Sorry if it's been asked before, I couldn't find it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've passed my dispatch function (parentDispatchFunction as the prop) from ParentComponent to ChildComponent. I need ChildComponent to call that Dispatch function but I need to pass in arguments from ChildComponent back up when I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to call the dispatch function directly with "parentDispatchFunction" (which works), but when I try to pass things back in with "parentDispatchFunction(argumentFromChild)" it doesn't call the parent function at all. I don't know how to dynamically access the function to change the parameters, or call it with parameters directly. Could someone please help me? Thank you!
