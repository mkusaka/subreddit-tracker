Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fnfky9/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hello rustaceans,

I started learning Go about one year ago. I started my journey in computer science/security from C so going back (from Python and JS) to a compiled, strongly typed language made me feel somehow home. Two things I appreciated a lot are the ecosystem and the Go community. The tools are well done and the community is very welcoming.

In the meantime I discovered this beautiful language called Rust. I know the public opinion is that Go is competing with Rust, but for me it served as a bridge. Reading the rust book I caught myself saying under my breath "No freaking way..." more than once. Everything just clicked and just made sense. Besides the content I was impressed by the initiative of writing such a wonderful resource to help virtually anyone transition to Rust. Cargo is so incredibly polished that it was a pleasure even to just watch source code compile. Now to the main point. I heard plenty of good stuff about Rust's community and they all proved to be true. The thing that pushed me to post this is seeing an anon's post here a few days ago, being quite on the offensive about Rust being unsafe. More than once he proved a lot of bias which kind of drove me insane just by reading it. I was shocked to see how rustaceans responded with information, sources and explanations pointing out the differences in perspective. It was just incredible. This is just an example, there are more where this came from.

Go's ecosystem and community are cool, I'm not trying to deny it. But for me,  Rust is superior in every way, except maybe the breadth and maturity of some packages. But this will come with time, I'm not worried at all.

Congratulations for building such a community. I am looking forward to finish the introductory stuff in the language and be a part of it. Continue to shock me and be at least as awesome as you are

## [12][does std::Vec::clear() leak memory?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fvynya/does_stdvecclear_leak_memory/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fvynya/does_stdvecclear_leak_memory/

I am porting [a c library][1] into rust and i could use vector.clear() to empty a vector of PhysicsManifolds. Is that dangerous? I heard that in cpp, when you do a `new PhysicsManifold` the vector.clear() method leaks memory. Is that the same on rust?  

EDIT, to elaborate:

suppose you have a vec of `physicsManifold`s:  
```c

while(!gameLoopEnded()) {
    auto contacts = std::vector&lt;physicsManifold*&gt;;
    contacts.push_back(new physicsManifold);
    contacts.push_back(new physicsManifold);
    contacts.push_back(new physicsManifold);
    contacts.push_back(new physicsManifold);
    contacts.push_back(new physicsManifold);
}
```

In C++, such behavior causes memory leaks, and is prevented with `unique_ptr`.  
Is it the same in rust?

Thanks!
