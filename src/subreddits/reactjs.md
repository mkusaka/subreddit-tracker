We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I've been building ReactJS authentication, but after taking a stroll around the internet for how to handle authentication in react, I get that there are multiple ways to do so such as using ContextProviders or by using Redux State. Then to store the authentication token, for some, it is a cookie-based solution, while others add local storage based solution. But I'd like to know if there are any standard practices while handling authentication in ReactJS?

I am starting a new project and want to explore whether Context API is sufficient on itâ€™s own. Are there any use cases wherein Redux might be needed ?

hi. 

i'm starting new project with electron and react. I wanna read local svg files in electron and store it in react app  through ipc. 

i wanna try to use apollo for storing data but my friend said  since there is no backend server redux would be better choice. 

in this situation, which one is suitable for project?
