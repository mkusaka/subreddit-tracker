For securing/obfuscating Javascript code, can i use Obfuscator.io AND Jscrambler to get double the obfuscation? I like Obfuscator.io for all its features and its strong security guarantees, but jscrambler looks pretty good with its ability to turn code into impossible-for-humans-to-read brackets. I was thinking combined maybe this could provide a super strong guarantee of obfuscation. Its possible to do both, right?

I want code obfuscation robust enough so that, say i have a game written in javascript, a cheater cant manipulate this code to cheat on earning points. How secure do you think i can get my javascript code?

And other recommendations you might make?
