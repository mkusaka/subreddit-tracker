Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

A month ago my app got suspended due to manipulated media policy(which after reading them I think I am complying with), the appeals got rejected. Google is not responding to my emails.

Meanwhile another app which has 100% similar functionality is up on the Google Play. 

Is there anything in the Google's policies that they should treat all apps fairly?

Is there anything I can do?
## [4][What is the current consensus about Data Binding in the Android Development community?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j4x4ok/what_is_the_current_consensus_about_data_binding/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j4x4ok/what_is_the_current_consensus_about_data_binding/

So I've inherited a two and a half year old codebase which basically implements DataBinding architecture using MVVM architecture almost exactly as laid out in this Youtube video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=TW9dSEgJIa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=TW9dSEgJIa8)

It doesn't use Android ViewModel classes or LiveData but instead custom ViewModel classes which extend the Databinding Observable interface and LifeCyclerObserver. The Activities and Fragments then observe the ViewModel which basically then propagates changes to the UI Layer or calls methods in the UI layer (all written in xml) using notifyChange() or notifyPropertyChange() methods.

Now my instinct is to not really like this pattern, as I feel that it makes the code a lot less readable and too abstract, and having all the methods written in the xml layer (and all the recycler view adapters attached in the xml layer) makes the code a lot harder to debug. It also seems to require quite a learning curve for the developer, and if we were to hire some junior developers I would worry that it would take quite a while for them to get used to this way of writing code, which is a time and money overhead for the business.

On the other hand, I do appreciate the beauty of having your UI automatically responding to the state of your model, and making booleans etc. observable cuts down a lot of code and makes it more difficult to introduce logical errors. It also means that activities and fragments are about a third of the size in terms of lines of code (although I'd also argue that although there are less lines of code to write, the mental effort of understanding the observable pattern and ensuring your xml and Viewmodel adheres to the class names automatically generated by the Data Binding library doesn't necessarily make it more efficient)

In short- I'm not sure whether to propose a rewrite of the architecture to make it more readable and understandable for new developers, or whether to propose a partial rewrite to utilise LiveData rather than the Databinding Observable (which seems outdated now), or whether I'm just being ignorant, and not appreciating the advantages and the full beauty of Databinding.

Thoughts?

## [6][Is it possible to migrate a SQLite database belonging to an Android app from internal storage to external storage or vice versa?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j4okjy/is_it_possible_to_migrate_a_sqlite_database/)

The app I want to contribute to only supports internal storage. Users want to store their data on an SD card. I‚Äôd like to add a setting you can toggle along the lines of ‚Äúuse external storage‚Äù. But then if you currently have any data stored it would have to migrate the db from internal to external as it would be too buggy and messy to have two SQLite db‚Äôs. Any idea how to do this?

Hello everybody,

I started a new android app project. I will develop an application for my university. I have an own gitlab server and all my projects are there stored. But for this project, a fellow student (I hope it's the right word) give me an advice to take the app from the beginning to GitHub and making the project open source.

I do this never before, so, what would me bring this? What do you thing about the idea?
## [8][Strategy for in-app updates: use Google library or custom solution ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j4fchz/strategy_for_inapp_updates_use_google_library_or/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j4fchz/strategy_for_inapp_updates_use_google_library_or/

Looking at app version stats lately, it came to my attention that a significant number of users are using older versions of my app.

&amp;nbsp;

Hence the utility to notify users of available updates in app so they can optionally update. I would only do optional updates, not forced ones.

There's the Google [in-app update library](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates) for this, but looks rather heavy and complicated and I can see that thing causing unforeseen crashes already.

&amp;nbsp;

I wonder if a simple custom solution detecting if a newer version is published (easy with Firebase config) and if that's the case showing a dialog with some explanation text and a button that goes to the Play Store page app of the app, would not be better. The advantages I can see is:

- straightforward to implement
- can control the text displayed to the user to incentivize him to 
update (if only mentioning that updates fixes bugs and add new functionality)
- way easier to test

&amp;nbsp;

Any thoughts and experience on this ?

We just released our first game on the play store after utilizing internal testing and betas. When I go to the play store link it shows (Internal Beta) after it and "You're an internal tester." I disabled all testing tracks, I removed all testers from the list, I uploaded an empty release for internal track even but I still show up as internal build instead of release build.

Any way to fix??
## [12][Do you pay taxes in the countries where Google does not for your In-App purchases or subscriptions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j4h64c/do_you_pay_taxes_in_the_countries_where_google/)

I just added an in-app purchase in one of my apps for the first time of my life.

After reading the [official doc](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138000?hl=en) I decided to deploy the app only in those countries where Google does the tax payment for me, just to avoid the overhead of having to pay by myself in each country.

My question is, for those of you that have in-app purchases, how do you manage that? Do you sell in all countries and in that case, how do you manage this tax payments?
