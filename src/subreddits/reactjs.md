We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I know react naturally escapes anything put into JSX, but with &lt;a&gt; tags, someone could put a hazardous url with something like href=‚Äújavascript:alert(‚Äúxss attack here‚Äù)‚Äù and commit an xss attack. However, the user would have to click on the link. I‚Äôm wondering if any malicious code put into an src or alt attribute could ever actually be executed by the browser

I notice a lot of buzz around Tailwind these last couple of weeks.

I‚Äôve been using styled components for a while and so far I‚Äôm very happy with it but I was wondering if there was some benefit to maybe using them together? 

Is there something that Tailwind brings to the table that can actually make a big impact?

Cheers!
## [8][Can someone give a more real-world example where the setState(updaterFunc) function is more useful than the setState(object)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eqfvmd/can_someone_give_a_more_realworld_example_where/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eqfvmd/can_someone_give_a_more_realworld_example_where/
---
 the react docs said that is better to use the setState(updaterFunc) rather than the setState(object) because it will have the latest state. I know setState is async, that's why we use the setState(updaterFunc) to have the latest state. But in the example below I just can't wrapped my head around why should I use the setState(updaterFunc) when I can do it in one go with just the setState(object)

But I'm confused why should I do multiple setState calls rather than just doing it in one go.

    this.setState((state) =&gt; ({ counter: state.counter + 1}));
    this.setState((state) =&gt; ({ counter: state.counter + 1}));
    this.setState((state) =&gt; ({ counter: state.counter + 1 }));

why not do it just like this?

    this.setState({counter: 3});

Hello All,

I today I just set up a react-redux application using typescript, redux-thunk technology. In this project, I have used a container pattern. I am requesting to all, Could you review my code, Suggestions really appreciated and help my carrier. Here is a project GitHub link [https://github.com/devbinod/react-redux-typescript](https://github.com/devbinod/react-redux-typescript?fbclid=IwAR34tSFuyhGEWJ2Uzzg9fWrUaiYqvK-bvF1_JFMiDK8k3fJZyIzp45dnIl4).

I have been working on react js for the past two years and constantly facing this issue, people who have implemented re-using components across different apps with minimum hassle, do share your aproaches as it would be nice and help others benift too.  


I do know about [Bit](https://bit.dev/) but this has been somewhat a recent development, i wonder what other approaches can be used for large scale applications.

Is mounting when a new node is inserted into DOM tree, and painting when the browser translates the updated DOM +CSS tree (render tree) into its ui?

I was a redux fanboy and would defend everything about redux(when I was creating redux project). But now I'm maintaining several redux projects, I start to rethink and now posting this topic to ask for a discussion.

And when talking about redux, I'm referring to essentially all the state management tools on the market. Because other than maybe mobx-state-tree, everything is the same. Yeah, some might not ask for immutability and some may have a different way to write action object, but other than that everything propose the exact same structure of state management.

It sure provides benefit. As managing state become automatic as you don't have to make any decision as where to put the state and how to fetch them. And with dev tools you can pretty much click around the app and know which user input result in what state changes.

That said, still

1. I don't think everything in a global store the best practice. It might be a pleasure to write at first, but will be a nightmare for others to maintain. Adding a little pop window will require you the knowledge of so many implantation detail as in file structure and also writing code snippets everywhere. And the main defect of this approach is most states are not really global, simply stripe it away from where we expect it to be (the component with related UI) and cluster them in a big store is a huge mental setback for the maintainer of the code. Think that we all agree to gather code by logic approximation rather than format(css/js/html) nowadays, but redux keep those code that should stay together far away.
2. Having only some of the states in global store is also a headache. The problem is what could be the criteria for putting a state into the global store? How global should a state to be consider global? It might not be a problem for small project from a single developer but sure it can be hard to follow some vague rules collectively.
3. The boilerplate of redux is one of the worst to write. Switch....case....payload... action.type.... **Basically action.type is function name and action.payload is function parameters and reducer is the function body.** Can't we have a better implementation so we don't have to write a function in 2 files and 3 places? To me this structure is just not ideal at all.
4. Before anyone say anything about useReducer and context, they are essentially the same thing, except now we can have multiple stores, all the problem above still persist.

Ok enough about my rant. I'm just curious how do everyone mange their projects' state now in the 2020, and what are you general opinion about redux and other state management tools?
