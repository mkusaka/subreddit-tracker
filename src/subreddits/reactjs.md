We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Why don't react components have a 'this' context, even when using bind? ( \*answered\*: I was using arrow functions which don't allow rebinding).

Updated Q:

Why does an arrow function in global scope return undefined as it's this value?

* Is it something to do with the arrow function looking to the module function for a this val, and the module function does not have a this val?
* Or is it something to do with modules being declarative environment records (not object environment records)?

## [9][Help with Router or Parcel links?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ex5e1p/help_with_router_or_parcel_links/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ex5e1p/help_with_router_or_parcel_links/
---
Can someone explain to an idiot like me on how can i configure **Router** or maybe it's a **Parcel** bundler thing so when clicking on the links it won't change the address bar to root of my website.

So i have menu item with links (Home Page/1stPage/2ndPage) when clicking one of them i would expect address bar to be like this: [https://www.marius.dev/projects/test2/1stPage](https://www.marius.dev/projects/test2/1stPage)

But instead I'm getting this: [https://www.marius.dev/1stPage](https://www.marius.dev/1stPage) , so it goes into the root of my website. This would not be an issue if my projects sits in the root, but i want to have multiple projects on my website.

Full code:

    import React from 'react'
    import { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
    import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'
    
    export default function App() {
      return (
        &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
          &lt;NavLink to="/" className="nav-link"&gt;
            Home Page
          &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    
          &lt;NavLink to="/1stPage" className="nav-link"&gt;
            1st Page
          &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    
          &lt;NavLink to="/2ndPage" className="nav-link"&gt;
            2nd Page
          &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    
          &lt;Switch&gt;
            &lt;Route exact path="/"&gt;
              &lt;div&gt;Home Page&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/Route&gt;
    
            &lt;Route exact path="/1stPage"&gt;
              &lt;div&gt;1st Page&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/Route&gt;
    
            &lt;Route exact path="/2ndPage"&gt;
              &lt;div&gt;2nd Page&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/Route&gt;
          &lt;/Switch&gt;
        &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
      )

I just started learning Ract.js and its pretty straight forward except for the life cycle methods, some of them are deprecated and it's really confusing on which of the should I learn. What are the life cycle methods that are not deprecated and the most useful / used? and what are their purpose (w/ example please). componentDidMount() is called when the component is added to the virtual dom, so why not just use the constructor instead? thank you.

I just wanted to make sure that I've got this straight in my head before continuing. This is as close as I can get to a minimal example of a single search form component that fetches data when submitted. 

Would love to get any feedback on whether this looks okay or if there are any improvements before I start looking at making a custom hook from it.
