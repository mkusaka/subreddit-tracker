Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hurj77/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

I read [RFC 2504 `fix_error`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2504-fix-error.md), but it doesn't seem to say anything about how *using* the new API works.

My impression of the status after reading issues [53487](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53487) and [58520](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58520) is that the RFC is pretty much implemented in nightly (which I'm using). I've also read several articles about the changes and all the third-party error crates that are being deprecated now. But I'm still not finding any explanation of how to *attach* context to errors.

Here's a concrete example. How would I use the new error features to have the error returned from `do_stuff` include information about which step resulted in an error?

```rust
type MyErr = Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), MyErr&gt; {
	let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = std::env::args().collect();
	do_stuff(&amp;args[1], &amp;args[2], &amp;args[3])
}

fn do_stuff(file1: &amp;str, file2: &amp;str, file3: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;(), MyErr&gt; {
	let text = std::fs::read_to_string(file1)?;
	std::fs::write(file2, text)?;
	std::fs::remove_file(file3)?;
	Ok(())
}
```

Hey, folks. Just wanted to let everyone know that I just dropped the latest episode of my podcast, The Virtual World. In this episode I was able to sit down with Steve Klabnik, a member of the Rust core team. I asked him a ton of questions about himself and the Rust programming language and ecosystem. Some of the info may surprise you!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I'll be interviewing Alex Chrichton from the core team later today as well!
