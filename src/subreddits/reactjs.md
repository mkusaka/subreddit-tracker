I canâ€™t paste my code right now.

Thanks!!

I'd love some help here!

I'm a beginner, so thank you for your advice and patience! I currently have a button that, on click, calls a function called "seriesPopup" that looks like this:

`seriesPopup() {`

`var seriesLabel = prompt("Please enter the series name and choose a dataset:", "Series");`

  `}`

I want an object type prop in the current component that updates itself with the result of seriesLabel when the prompt is submitted. 

Right now, the defaultProps contains an object that looks like this:

`UsersOverview.defaultProps = {`  
`chartData: {`

`datasets: [`

`{`

`label: "Test"`

`}`

`]}}`

How would I update the "label" value in this object? I realize that this is in a defaultProps, which is not the ideal situation, so how would I update the prop outside of that? How can I make this.props.chartData.datasets\[0\]\[0\] equal seriesLabel?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

I have only been learning React for 2 weeks so far I have learnt react router and styled components.  

And I  want to see how others people structure there code base and use react with styled components.  

And  I want to see how other people are using react in a real applications.  

At the moment I am trying to get better at css but I want to see how other people use react with styled components.

There's just a single token which is issued upon login and is used to authorize requests. The token has a life of two weeks and to renew it I have to send a request to an endpoint with this current token before it expires. How can I write code to automate this?
