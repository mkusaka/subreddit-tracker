This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi,

I'm interested in android app development. My main ideas are to make some casual games like Angry Birds or Bubbleball. 

But I don't want to work for someone (either getting a 9-5 or freelancing). I want to make a living totally independently. 

My making a living, even $500 a month would be enough but I also want to have a chance of making it big. 

So what are the different ways to make money as an android app developer?

## [7][TIL How to use FragmentStateAdapter with ViewPager2 with Dynamic Fragments](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ffso1z/til_how_to_use_fragmentstateadapter_with/)

If you have a ViewPager that Dynamically adds, removes or updates Fragments you **NEED** to override [getItemId](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/viewpager2/adapter/FragmentStateAdapter#getItemId(int)) and [containsItem](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/viewpager2/adapter/FragmentStateAdapter#containsItem(long)) to avoid bugs where you change the data and fragment wouldn't change or have a wrong state.

extra info: we're using ViewPager2 to do a step like registration and changing the registration flow based on api errors
