Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

I'm a heavy C programmer, but from the sound of it, Rust has quite a lot to offer due to it's novel design principles. Does anyone have an example of an exceptionally well-written Rust program that demonstrates the features and philosophy of the language? 

You know, one you could point to and say, "this is what it means to write in Rust". Ideally around a few thousand lines so that a single person could reasonably come to understand? 

Thanks in advance : )

I want to help make a project called Lemmy federated using ActivityPub, but I have no experience with ActivityPub. Are there any good tutorials on the topic that you'd recommend? Particularly tutorials or documentation relevant to programming it in Rust, since it's what the Lemmy backend is written in.

## [11][How long does your project take to recompile after a small change?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/exlawm/how_long_does_your_project_take_to_recompile/)

I've read that Rust compile times are slower compared to C++ compile times. Compile times were ok with my multiple source files hello world projects even with multiple external crates \`use\`d. But then I wanted to know how fast is Rust project recompilation after small change on a little bit larger than hello world projects, I took amethyst game engine.

Initial compilation of amethyst examples took some time, but it's ok for initial build. Then I tried to add and remove \`println!()\` things randomly in those examples' [main.rs](https://main.rs), and god it takes 20-22 secs for \`cargo build\` to process single tiny change even without --release flag.

So do large Rust projects get slower to recompile over growth of project size? Is it amethyst's fault that it takes so much time for single line change recompilation or is it common/acceptable in Rust?
