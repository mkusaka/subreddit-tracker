Hey everyone! So for the last few weeks I‚Äôve been designing and beginning to implement a GraphQL API using Prisma. I‚Äôm at a stage where I have enough of an API foundation to think about developing frontend. I‚Äôll be using react-native and I have a few questions regarding fetching data from my API. I want to be able to provide users with an offline experience and therefore require cache. I also want to use subscriptions (real-time functionality in GraphQL). I‚Äôve found Apollo Client and seen that it has a lot of good reviews, however, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the built in React components that display the data. I haven‚Äôt used them so I can‚Äôt really be sure that I don‚Äôt like them, however I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be great for query testing which isn‚Äôt a huge deal since I‚Äôll be thoroughly testing my API and Prisma is tested. On the other hand I‚Äôve used redux in the past and am wondering if it has the possibly of acting as a sort of cache when paired with simple https requests. Any thoughts are appreciated! üôè

I haven‚Äôt yet had any reason to use it since I place all the props I need in mapStateToProps which goes into the connect function. I was pretty good at passing props around in React but now that I have added Redux I‚Äôm not too sure how props are passed around. 

I‚Äôm making an application with Redux because I want to expand my web development ‚Äútoolkit‚Äù. So even though my application doesn‚Äôt really need Redux I‚Äôm just curious about how to use it. I feel like I‚Äôve been taught Redux badly or maybe I‚Äôm just not getting it but if you know of any good resources for me to learn that would be great too.

I am trying to pass an array from a container to a component inside of the container. the issue im having is that i dispatch my  actions in componentDidMount of the container. then i try passing the array that is acquired to the comp but it passes the initial state, an empty array, instead of the third and final state

I want to know useful patterns/arquitecture for big enterprise projects used in nextjs(react) with redux. 
i've seen some recomendations like [this](https://laniewski.me/javascript/react/redux/2019/02/28/enterprise-scale-react-redux-project-architecture.html) or [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-organize-your-react-+-redux-codebase)  where application is split in `modules` that encapsulates all related things with it, Redux(actions, reducers, sagas), utils, ts-types, and jsx|tsx components and have one folder for shared things. I like this concept because it is easy to identify the related elements between the store and the ui layer inside modules, but I don't know if it's really scalable for big enterprise projects. I would like to hear recommendations and/or suggested articles.

So I have this component in React.  The {props.size} and {props.algorithm} only show up after I have submitted them. Upon init, my component's props are `options`, and `dispatch`, as opposed to `size` and `algorithm` as specified in `mapStateToProps`. 

mapDispatchToProp is given by default. It appears to work normally as the size and algorithm of the value does render on the page. But if I want to access size and algorithms before hitting submit, I have to do `{props.options.size}` and `{props.options.algorithm}`. After submitting `props.options` become undefined

Here's my component:

    const Options_Component = (props) =&gt; {
        const {register, handleSubmit, errors, reset} = useForm({
            validateCriteriaMode: 'all',
            mode: 'onSubmit',
            reValidateMode: 'onSubmit',
            defaultValues: {
                size: INITIAL_SIZE,
                algorithm: INITIAL_ALGORITHM
            }
        });
        
        const onSubmit = values =&gt; {
            const inputs = changeOptions({size: 50})
            props.dispatch(inputs);
        }
    
        return (
            &lt;header&gt;
                &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}&gt;
                    &lt;div&gt;{props.size}&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div&gt;{props.algorithm}&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;input type="submit"/&gt;
                    &lt;input type="button" value="Reset to default" onClick={()=&gt; reset()}/&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/header&gt;
        );
    }
    
    const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) =&gt; ({
        size: state.options.size,
        algorithm: state.options.algorithm
    })
    
    export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Options_Component)

My App - Option component is a child of SortVisualizer

    function App() {
      return (&lt;Provider store={OptionStore}&gt;
        &lt;SortVisualizer/&gt;
      &lt;/Provider&gt;)
    }
    
    export default App;
    

Reducer and createStore:

    export default function (state = initialState, {type, payload}) {
        console.log({type, payload})
        switch (type) {
            case CHANGE_OPTIONS:
                console.log(type, payload)
                const {size = initialValue.INITIAL_SIZE, algorithm = initialValue.INITIAL_ALGORITHM} = payload
                return {size: size, algorithm: algorithm}
            default: return {...state}
        }
    }
    
    export const changeOptions = options =&gt; ({
        type: CHANGE_OPTIONS,
        payload: options
    })
    
    export default combineReducers({options}); &lt;--- Root Reducer
    
    export default createStore(rootReducer);

Just refactoring a small app to use Redux and hooks and noticing something strange. In index.js I have:   


    ...
    
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import { rootReducer } from './reducers/rootReducer.js';
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
    
    ReactDOM.render(
      &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
        &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
          &lt;App /&gt;
        &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
      &lt;/Provider&gt;,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );

My root reducer is defined in another file I am importing and I have confirmed that is firing in the console. Yet for some reason when I inspect the redux dev tools I see a bunch of data related to my reddit user acccount oddly enough and not the initial state I defined in rootReducer which is passed to createStore  


At this point should I not be able to see my store in redux dev tools?
