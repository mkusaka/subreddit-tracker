Guys can you share some of your projects through which you gained more insights on the working of Golang.

Sorry for bad English.

I saw quite a lot of comments saying projects like Kubernetes having a Java pattern. What are these kind of patterns and what would the Go way of doing it look like?

Hi all,

I've just published my homemade WASM virtual machine purely written in Go. I did this just for fun and for learning WASM specification. 

With gasm, you can embed VMs in your go programs without any dependencies like cgo. Calling host functions from WASM modules and execution of exported functions in WASM modules are supported.

Although it seems to have tons of bugs, I would like to share this personal project as it works fine with basic examples.

Thanks!

Hi, anyone know of a Go SDK for developing MS office addons?  
Specifically MS Outlook for windows/mac.
## [8][Installing extra Go versions, not to $HOME/sdk directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/gejprx/installing_extra_go_versions_not_to_homesdk/)

According to [https://golang.org/doc/install#extra\_versions](https://golang.org/doc/install#extra_versions) it's possible to install multiple Go versions by  `get` and `download`:

    ~
    [I] ➜ go get golang.org/dl/go1.14.2
    
    ~
    [I] ➜ go1.14.2
    go1.14.2: not downloaded. Run 'go1.14.2 download' to install to /home/vald/sdk/go1.14.2

Is this possible to change the location, for instance, to `$HOME/.sdks`?

Hi, I'm working on a project, and we've gotten to the point where using the traditional go commands has become cumbersome, and my initial idea is to add a makefile for this.  


Unless people have any better ideas? :)
