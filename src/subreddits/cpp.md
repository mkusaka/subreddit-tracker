**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely (permanently, or for the duration of the pandemic)? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

## [3][Documentation options](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hke35s/documentation_options/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hke35s/documentation_options/

Hi,

I have the opportunity to introduce a documentation platform for a project I’m involved on. The documentation is for a large C/C++ code base. I’ve never been responsible for externally facing documentation for developers, so I’m hoping to get some opinions and insight. Has anyone used a documentation, platform, format, etc that they would recommend? I’m aware of Doxygen and have used it in the past, but have mixed feelings about how useful those documents tend to be and it’s impact on the readability of header files. Maybe I’ve never configured Doxygen enough, though. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated! :)

I've recently had to move from gcc to msvc, and got a very strange error message. It seems the compiler is interpreting the lambda body as an initializer list being passed to the lambda constructor? Anyway, gcc and clang have absolutely no problem compiling this code, no warnings occur even with all the warning flags provided. Are there some obscure rules about nesting lambdas I'm not aware of? I'd be grateful if someone could take a look, I'm honestly stumped.

## [10][I think there's a bug in MSVC std::unordered_set](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hkf04w/i_think_theres_a_bug_in_msvc_stdunordered_set/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hkf04w/i_think_theres_a_bug_in_msvc_stdunordered_set/

    int main() {
    	std::unordered_set&lt;int&gt; set;
    	set.emplace(1);
    
    	for (auto&amp; i : set)
    	{
    		std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    		if (i == 1)
    		{
    			set.erase(i);
    		}
    	}
    
    
    	std::getchar();
    	return 0;
    }

this creates a segmentation fault.

According to [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set/erase):

&gt;References and iterators to the erased elements are invalidated. Other iterators and references are not invalidated.

and also

&gt;The order of the elements that are not erased is preserved. (This makes  it possible to erase individual elements while iterating through the  container.)

&amp;#x200B;

According to the standard, the above code is perfectly fine, and the loop should stop immediately after the first iteration . In real life, `erase` does corrupt the internal state of the set, causing segmentation fault. commenting the `erase` code "fixes" the bug.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong?
## [11][Why taking the address of an xvalue (&amp;std::move(...)) is an error?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hkc3qv/why_taking_the_address_of_an_xvalue_stdmove_is_an/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hkc3qv/why_taking_the_address_of_an_xvalue_stdmove_is_an/
---
I came across this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/cpp-value-categories) while trying to understand the glvalues. The source of the article is "Stroustrup, 2013 - The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition". 

More specifically, i wanted to understand why lvalues and xvalues are grouped together as glvalues. Turned out, it is the concept of identity. 

The article says that a glvalue (lvalue or xvalue) has an identity, where identity is explained as:

&amp;gt; If you have (or you can take) the memory address of a value and use it safely, then the value has identity.

However, taking the address of an xvalue is an error:

    std::string str;
    auto p = &amp;std::move(str); //Error (can't take address of an rvalue)

I understand that there should not be a reason to take an address of an xvalue but I want to understand the rationale behind flagging it as an error when it goes against the concept of an xvalue having an identity. 

Thank You
