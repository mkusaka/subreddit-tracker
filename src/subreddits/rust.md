Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fg0p1v/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Working on some projects, I needed a way to implement Flatbuffers/Cap'N Proto objects dynamically at runtime.  The schema of the objects has to be flexible and might not be known before compile time.

I'm like 2 months into Rust and this is the first (hopefully) useful thing I've put together, any feedback is appreciated. :)

Hi Rustaceans,

I've became Rustacean since yesterday.

I'm reading "The Rust Programming Language" official book.

After finishing this book, what book do you recommend for further deep learning and advanced topics?

## [10][I want to write a pseudo linter in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fk1877/i_want_to_write_a_pseudo_linter_in_rust/)

Their is a simulation code I use for work that takes script files to define commands and variables. The files can be complex and include other files. Basically, it works like a programming language.

Some common mistakes (at least the ones I make) can be catched before runtime so I thought about writing a pseudo linter. As I love Rust I though this would be a cool project to learn more about the language. I made a first version in python but i'm unsatisfied with the way I did it (brute force algorithm read line, define command read line, check if defined etc). Plus I would like to run it asynchronously with my text editor so it should be light and fast (at least fast). 

Are their any rust written linters that I could check to get inspiration from? Or do you have any advice on where I should go? Is it a good project as I'm not a very skilled rustacean?

Regards.
