Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I just saw this and got excited - I hope it’s legit as I think it’s from the person actually writing the code for Concepts in Clang.

It seems rather odd to deprecate functionality before offering a suitable alternative, but I have not found one.

Hi all,

I have just published a full-fledged manual for the Meson build system as an ebook (PDF only). The text is written specifically for C and C++ developers and contains lots of topical info, such as how to create a library that exports a plain C api but is implemented in C++ so that it works correctly on multiple platforms.

The book can be purchased from [this web site only](https://meson-manual.com/). The site contains further info including a full sample chapter on how compilation works. I have also written [a blog post](https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-meson-manual-is-now-available-for.html) with further details and answers to frequently asked questions.

As I'm the creator of both the book and Meson, feel free to AMA, I shall do my best to answer any questions you may have.
## [7][Best Practice: External library dependencies on different machines?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/es9q2h/best_practice_external_library_dependencies_on/)

Hello, everybody,  

in our software project we have different projects that depend on the always the same libraries (googletest, re2, rapidjson, etc.) Since different programs are deployed on different machines, these libraries are always rebuilt and linked.    

My question would be: Is it possible to build these dynamic libraries, install them in a given directory and then put this directory into a git repository? Then, on the target machines, only this repository would be checked out and the build process would be bypassed.   

How do dynamic libraries behave in C++ when linked on different Ubuntu distributions or with different compilers? Are there compatibility or performance issues? What are best practices on this topic? Are there any good sources I can refer to?

Kind regards

Determining the Mime Type of a file In C has not been easy.  Developers need an external table , which usually comes as an external file, which contains just a few mime types of various file extensions, Well I don't blame the developers, THERE IS NO ALGORITHM TO CHECK THE MIME TYPE OF A FILE. What if the FILE was deleted ? . That will be very awful for the program. Most people who do not want to use external files normally resort to using web services. This can unbearably slow, because of network problems.

Now these problems of determining the MIME TYPE of a file from your C Code can be solved by [MegaMimes](https://github.com/trumpowen/MegaMimes). [MegaMimes](https://github.com/trumpowen/MegaMimes) is a C Library that is used to determine the MIME Type of a file, with just a few code. The MIME Type table comes embedded in the library and as a result, no need for external files, web services and any other technique.  The library works on all major Operating Systems ( Windows, Linux,, Mac OS X ) . The library can be extended by adding your own mime types, if they do not exist in the table. [MegaMimes](https://github.com/trumpowen/MegaMimes) has no dependencies, which makes it very easy to install!!!!

Do not fail to check it out. If the library proves helpful to you, do not forget to give it a STAR. If you have any contributions, you can open a pull request and an issue. Thank You
