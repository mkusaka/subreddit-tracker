## [9][Promote from beta to production with timed release impossible? Or am I doing smth wrong?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j1wfaj/promote_from_beta_to_production_with_timed/)

Hey all,

We have an app that has a production version and a version in the beta-channel.

Our production entry at store-listing clearly states: "Timed release".

Whenever I promote the beta version to production it removes the timed release and immediately releases which causes us a lot of problems because the backend hasn't been released yet.

Is there no way to promote from beta to production and retain the timed release :-(? Or am I missing something?

Cheers

Hello noob here, final year CS, I've been doing Android for the last few months if the Quarantine and I'm enjoying it so much that I may just decide to specialise in it for my career, so what do I need to know to work in the industry as a professional?

I know that one needs to know, Java/Kotlin, XML, how Android studio works, SQL for DB and Android architecture what else am I missing? I see a lot of buzzwords when I browse this sub. 

Note that I'm not asking about all the things in Android dev i know it will impossible for a single person to know everything, just asking for the essential must-know stuff.
## [11][Exclude certain Android versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j1yx5g/exclude_certain_android_versions/)

My app targets Android 11, just because I don't want Google Play to stop me from updating my app. But at the moment, the core function of my app is not working on Android 11.

Is it possible to hide my app listing from Android 11 users so that they don't end up downloading my app and reviewing "it's not working". ?
## [12][Restore dynamically added view state on orientation change](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j1t9np/restore_dynamically_added_view_state_on/)

Im currently working with custom views which will be added to a layout dynamically. I understand how view states are safed and restored.

According to the documentation, only views with an id will be persisted by the system. So the suggested solution is to use \`\`\`View.getViewId()\`\`\` in order to set an id to each dynamically added view.

The problem is, that on orientation change, each view which gets an id via this method, will get a different id than before the orientation change happened. This prevents the view state from being restored since the ids don't match up.

    Easiest setup to try this: Add an EditText programmatically to an activity, give it an id with ```View.generateViewId()``` then enter some text and rotate.

Am I missing something? Is there no way to give ids to dynamically added views so that they restore themselves on orientation changes?
