Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

Hi everyone.  I'm rather new to React, I'm creating a Spotify playlist building app for my portfolio.  I've been searching all over but can't really find a solution.  I want to be able to scroll to my "tracks" component after the playlist is built.  This component renders only after http request and the track list is populated.  The button that initiates the http request is in a sibling component to the tracks component, so I'm not trying to scroll/navigate to a nested component, rather a component which shares the same parent but is conditionally rendered.

Any tips?  Is it possible to get a reference to a component that is not nested in the component where the "click" happens?

Thanks!

Hey there, fellow r/reactjs lurkers and devs!

I made this neat little Resume Builder project, completely free and open-source for anyone to use. It is a minimalistic and straightforward resume builder that focuses on clean design, user data privacy, quick ease of use, and easy resume updates. If you are someone who cares about any of these issues, this might be of help to you!

Check it out here: [https://rx-resume.web.app/](https://rx-resume.web.app/)

Hey React folks ðŸ‘‹

I've been working on a GraphQL book for at least the past year and I finally released it on Monday this week. I know a lot of React devs wanting to know more about **GraphQL** **server** **design** and I felt like there wasn't so much on the subject.

Over the past 4 years I've worked on the Shopify GraphQL API and currently at GitHub. I've also been helping a lot of organizations with their move to GraphQL and this is everything I know about it in book form!   
If you're interested, it's for sale here: [http://book.productionreadygraphql.com/](http://book.productionreadygraphql.com/)

You can also get the ToC right here if you don't know if it's for you: [Table of Contents](http://book.productionreadygraphql.com/static/toc.pdf)

**Explore this universe**

https://proton-native.js.org/

**About**

Proton Native is a small project to try and create a React interface for desktop app building. Proton Native was designed as an alternative to Electron. Rather than building apps that use the overhead of Electron and web technologies, Proton Native allows you to use native widgets cross platform, all in a React environment that you would get with Electron.

**Advantages**

- No large web browser running your app
- Better system compatibility
- Simple React components that are the same as React Native components
- Constantly being improved and added to

**Disadvantages**

- Currently smaller than Electron
- Smaller community since Proton Native is newer

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fpvvhi/api_design_how_to_make_a_component_with/

I am asking this from a UIKit developer perspective in terms of providing an API. I am going to provide an example; so that, it is easier to visualize what I am trying to tell.

I have a controlled `Filter` component that opens a custom Autofill dropdown based on the given query string (something similar to Google Search's input box).

Here is how it is being used currently (currently, I am fetching data by non-suspense means in usage):

    &lt;Filter
      value={value}
      onChange={handleChange}
      options={options}
      loading={loading}
      {...otherProps}
    /&gt;

So, the data fetching process starts when the user enters anything in the input.

React Docs suggest that Concurrent UI patterns should be implemented at a [Design System level](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.html#baking-transitions-into-the-design-system) in order to simplify the developer experience for devs who use the design system.

Now, I have one place where I need to update the state. How am I supposed to design this? Let's say that I have an example like below (taken from third example [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.html#splitting-high-and-low-priority-state):

    &lt;Filter
      value={value}
      onChange={(val) =&gt; {
        // this is high priority state, needs to be updated immediately
        setValue(value);
        // transition should be here but I want the transition to be in the component
        setOptionsResource(fetchOptions(val));
      }}
      options={optionsResource}
      {...otherProps}
    /&gt;

Here is a preliminary implementation for the transition:

    // no more loading prop
    const Filter = ({ onOpen, onChange, ...otherProps }) =&gt; {
      const [startTransition, isPending] = useTransition({ timeoutMS: TIMEOUT });

      // this doesn't
      const handleChange = (e) =&gt; {
        // I am setting both input value and resource in `onChange`
        // but I need a way to separate it; so that, low priority resource
        // is happening in `startTransition`
        onChange(e.target.value);

        startTransition(() =&gt; {
          // how should pass resource setter here?
        });
      }

      // ...
    }

How can I separate these values? My only guess is that I need to add a new callback such as `populateData` or something similar. I don't like this approach because to me personally, it bleeds too many actions to the ui library.


---

My second question is regarding deferring in this situation. Previously, I was able to defer the `value` state because the entire fetching process was happening outside the scope of the UI library. Now, the fetching process is split into two parts -- transition in the UI library component and fetching is happening outside. Where should the deferring happen? Should it happen in the Filter component or should it happen outside the component?

In the component:

    const Filter = ({ onOpen, onChange, value, ...otherProps }) =&gt; {
      const [startTransition, isPending] = useTransition({ timeoutMS: TIMEOUT });
      const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value, { timeoutMS: DEFERRED_TIMEOUT });

      const handleChange = (e) =&gt; {
        // I am setting both input value and resource in `onChange`
        // but I need a way to separate it; so that, low priority resource
        // is happening in `startTransition`
        onChange(e.target.value);

        startTransition(() =&gt; {
          populateData(deferredValue);
        });
      }
    }

    // usage:

    &lt;Filter
      value={value}
      onChange={(val) =&gt; {
        // this is high priority state, needs to be updated immediately
        setValue(value);
      }}
      populateData={(val) =&gt; {
        setOptionsResource(fetchOptions(val));
      }}
      options={optionsResource}
      {...otherProps}
    /&gt;

    // or should it be like this:

    const debouncedValue = useDeferredValue(value, { timeoutMs: DEFERRED_TIMEOUT });

    return &lt;Filter
      value={value}
      onChange={(val) =&gt; {
        setValue(value);
      }}
      populateData={() =&gt; {
        // no argument in `populateData` function
        setOptionsResource(fetchOptions(deferredValue));
      }}
      options={optionsResource}
      {...otherProps}
    /&gt;

Concurrent mode is all new to me and I get that there are not many best practices available at the moment. However, I am trying to understand and prepare what kind of decisions that we need to make to future-proof my implementation. For example, I can set an API that is easier to migrate to concurrent mode in the future.

P.S I am currently not using Concurrent Mode in my apps in production. I am just curious as to how to approach this from a UI library maintainer perspective.
