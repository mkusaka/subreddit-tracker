This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

This is my first open-source app. It shows top stories from different sections. It uses Kotlin and jetpack libraries.

Pls, tell me what you think about it.

This is a question especially for those who didnt learn coding at uni. How do you know you know enough? Theres always more knowledge to learn so where is that tipping point? Was there a project you did on your own that made you confident you were ready?

Hello,

I have an application with a background service.  
When there is a certain signal, my application goes to foreground and shows something.

When the signal is removed, it shall go back to the last app that was open.

How can I do this?

Maybe: How can I simulate double pressing the back button?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone. First year CS student here who finished the Java MOOC except the JavaFX parts and just dove in google's android tutorials in Java. Apart from the MOOC, I don't have much experience with Java, but I do have experience with C from Uni and Python before uni. Learned a bit of OOP from GUI programming in python, but it got solidified doing Java's MOOC  which was mostly easy and I do think I've got the basics down.  Like I know how Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Anonymous Classes, Lambdas, Streams, Generics, basic unit testing and so on work. I've also recently got hold of a copy for Effective Java and Head First Design Patterns to help me write better and more efficient code. Just really want to dive into android atm and focus on that to get really used to one language and just keep making projects instead of jumping from one language to another.

Keeping these previous points in mind, will it be too soon to ditch Java for Kotlin? Should I get more comfortable with Java first and just power through google's slightly dated android tutorials in Java? Just heard that the Kotlin ones are the only ones getting updated frequently if I'm not mistaken? 

Thanks!

I would like that they could add more security for the following functions not to allow reset of the phone by buttons or screen if you do not have the unlocking pin of the cell phone to do it.
It also does not give the ability to turn off the device without the unlock pin.
Do not allow the unlock pin to be accessed without the corresponding pin.

It is now easy to steal a cell phone and to be able to restart it from the factory by pressing buttons and skipping the Security verification.
This encourages crime.

So my first app I built/am building with Java and traditional android views and I found the experience to be a bit painful (java is very verbose, compiling takes ages, themes and animations are a pain in the ass etc)

So now I'm interested in starting another app and maybe porting my current app to better tech but there seems to be two competing technologies? Dart+flutter and Kotlin+jetpack? Is that right? Why do both exist and which is better to learn? I like the idea of Flutter if it's cross platform but then why does Kotlin+Jetpack exist, does Flutter have limitations on native apps? Is Flutter something Google is likely to drop because it's not as popular? etc

Thanks for your advice and sorry if this is a stupid question.
