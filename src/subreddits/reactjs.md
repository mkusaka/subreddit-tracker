Hey guys! Been browsing reddit for some time but this is my first post. 

I've created a small hook which tells you when you've scrolled something to bottom: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-scroll-to-bottom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-scroll-to-bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the source code: [https://github.com/tudorgergely/use-scroll-to-bottom](https://github.com/tudorgergely/use-scroll-to-bottom) and you can see it in action here: [https://tudorgergely.github.io/use-scroll-to-bottom/](https://tudorgergely.github.io/use-scroll-to-bottom/)

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and I also created a small codesandbox if you want to try it: [https://codesandbox.io/s/stupefied-dirac-23z5q](https://codesandbox.io/s/stupefied-dirac-23z5q)

&amp;#x200B;

Not much, but maybe it helps someone.

Hi guys,

As a part of New Year Resolution I've made modular Datepicker component using hooks and date-fns.

[https://github.com/morewings/react-calendar-toolkit](https://github.com/morewings/react-calendar-toolkit)

Features:

* Localization (**69 languages** with the help of date-fns). Week starts according to provided locale.
* CSS vars based light **theming**.
* Developer can provide **custom render components** for each part of Datepicker.
* **Highlight** and **disable** any date or range.
* Small size **\~10kb.**
* **Typescript** friendly.
* **IE11** compatible.

Tweak examples and read the docs: [https://morewings.github.io/react-calendar-toolkit/](https://morewings.github.io/react-calendar-toolkit/)

How could I go about getting dummy data to use when practicing react ?  I am front  end developer with a goal of learning back end after I learn react so any ideas on how to get dummy data would be highly appreciated.
