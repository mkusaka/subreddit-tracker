Mine is over 10MB. Is it a lot? Or is it not?

How big is your build? What type of server stuff or website is it doing?

## [7][Is a lot of exported interfaces from a package a bad thing for API clarity? How can it be mitigated?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/f380ys/is_a_lot_of_exported_interfaces_from_a_package_a/)

When I'm writing a package, I've been using lots of interfaces in my structs and functions to make my code less fragile. 

The problem is, when I come to export my nice new code which uses these interfaces, I'm always debating how many of these interfaces I should also export.

My worry is that my package's API having a number of small interfaces exported obfuscates the useful, concrete code behind a layer of abstraction.

What's good practice for balancing using interfaces and keeping a clean package API? I've been hunting for some good advice on this from community articles, and the advice seems very contradictory.

Hi Guys

I'm currently developing a web application on go. However only some specific users should be able to access the application. The need to be in a specific Active Directory group.

I know that they are a ton of ldap packages available but I'm not quiet sure how to implement this.

Does anybode has some experience?
