Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g9a5sn/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

## Introduction 
[SuckIT](https://github.com/skallwar/suckit) is a multithreaded, open source web downloader written in Rust. It aims to recursively download webpages and allow offline browsing.

## Benchmark
As of right now, it's a _little_ faster (about 3460%) than HTTrack on a single core, 60 second run on http://book.toscrape.com/

name    | pages downloaded
------- | ----------------
suckit  |             2422
httrack |               70

http://book.toscrape.com/ is downloaded in 75s for 1 thread, 37s for 2 threads and 19s for 4 threads. It's more or less a linear time reduction

## Future

Some features are missing, such as a random delay between downloads (to avoid IP ban) or user agent support but they will come soon.

Any feedback, reviews or PRs are welcome !

Enjoy :)

I was surprised I didn't need to use any unsafe code.

    use core::any::TypeId;
    use std::any::Any;
    use std::collections::hash_map::HashMap;

    struct VecStorage {
        vecs: HashMap&lt;TypeId, Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;&gt;
    }

    impl VecStorage {
        pub fn new() -&gt; Self {
            VecStorage {
                vecs: HashMap::new(),
            }
        }

        pub fn push&lt;T: 'static&gt;(&amp;mut self, val: T) {
            let key = (&amp;val as &amp;dyn Any).type_id();
            let vec: Option&lt;&amp;mut Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt; = self.vecs.get_mut(&amp;key).map(|x| {
                x.as_mut()
                    .downcast_mut::&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;()
                    .expect("failed to downcast")
            });
            match vec {
                Some(v) =&gt; v.push(val),
                None =&gt; {
                    let mut v = Vec::new();
                    v.push(val);
                    self.vecs.insert(key, Box::new(v));
                }
            }
        }

        pub fn get&lt;T: 'static&gt;(&amp;mut self, index: usize) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;mut T&gt; {
            let key = TypeId::of::&lt;T&gt;();
            let vec: &amp;mut Vec&lt;T&gt; = self.vecs.get_mut(&amp;key)?.as_mut().downcast_mut::&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;()?;
            vec.get_mut(index)
        }
    }

    fn main() {
        let mut storage = VecStorage::new();
        storage.push(100);
        storage.push("Hello world".to_owned());
        storage.push(200);
        println!("{:?}", storage.get::&lt;i32&gt;(0));
        println!("{:?}", storage.get::&lt;String&gt;(0));
        println!("{:?}", storage.get::&lt;i32&gt;(1));
        println!("{:?}", storage.get::&lt;i32&gt;(2));
        // Some(100)
        // Some("Hello world")
        // Some(200)
        // None
    }
