Hi you all.

I saw this in the book Go in Action Pg 20

"In Go, all variables are passed by value. Since the value of a Pointer variable is the address to the memory being pointed to, passing pointer variables between functions is still considered a pass by value".

How is this a pass by value? I know we are passing the address of a variable but isn't that the same as saying we are passing a "reference" to the value contained in this address?

What's your opinion?

I'd like to know if there are any pain points for Go developers that could be addressed with code generation or any other areas where you think code generation might be valuable in Go. Stuff like boilerplate code, or in general any code that be cumbersome or time consuming to write and could do with code generation. I'm conducting a research on the topic of Program synthesis and Auto programming.

Please do share your valuable thoughts. Thanks.

Hi, I'm trying to create a simple, reusable base for my projects. Most of the time, APIs to be consumed by React Native apps.
Althought I love Go, I haven't been able to use it profesionally yet and I'm wondering how many things I did that may suck.

I tried to adhere to patterns like DDD or Bob's Clean Code, but not strictly, I also took points from go-kit.
Here's my code https://github.com/nerock/base , if anyone cares to take a quick look and tell me what sucks and what doesn't and why it would really help me.

Thanks!

I have been learning Go for a while now (my first programming language). A few resources I've used and my experience with them:

* gobyexample.com was my first introduction. It was easy to follow up until Errors. I came back to this a month later and went through it much more easily.

* https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ This was a great experience. I now love writing tests, and I've been doing the TDD approach ever since.

* https://ieftimov.com/ This guy... this guy has to write a book on Golang. His DS with Go articles and Testing with Go articles were a revelation. I haven't learned from any other resource as quickly or as efficiently as I've learned from this guy. If you are around, write a damn book, I'll buy it. 

* https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go I struggled at first with this one, but when I finished the previous, I came back to this and it was eye opening on so many topics. 

* Algorithms, 4th Edition. I picked this up and worked through the DS / Algorithms, and tried to implement them in Go (following a TDD approach). They use Java in their code examples and it proved difficult to follow the code. But I managed to get though it.

* I started doing easy/medium Leetcode problems in Go. I struggle with lots of them, but I learn heaps.  

* I don't like video tutorials. So much rambling instead of just getting to the point. Some of the most recommended on here even felt at times as pitches to paid premium content (especially the Jon Calhoun's Gophercises / Video tutorials). What works for me is long written articles with code examples and brief explanations of core fundamentals in a way that's not overwhelming. Just enough to make it through the code, and put off the rest until another article. 

Anyway, I fell in love with programming and although I have no experience with any other language, I'm in love with Go as much. My issue so far is I don't like doing web dev stuff (Learn Go with Tests has a tutroail on building a web app, I didn't enjoy that or any of a variety of web dev stuff).  What I enjoy is problem solving (like Leetcode problems), but that's not something I can do for a living. So I need your advice:

What other fields are out there where I'll be using Go to develop solutions for? I browsed around, and it's either Webdev or Machine Learning (math is beyond my grasp, dead-end). 

Are there any github projects that are not web dev/ML that I can contribute to? 

Any other advice is welcome. Thank you.
