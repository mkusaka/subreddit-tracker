Every time I've tried to use one of the many ncurses wrappers, there's like one blog post and if you're lucky some docs written for C programmers.

I've tried reading the 'sup' source and it wasn't really helpful. Is the windowed TUI the stuff of wizards in 2020?

Hi All -

Can't quite figure this one out, hoping the /r/ruby brains trust can help me out.

I have code similar to this:

    cmd = get\_string\_from\_requestor
    case cmd
    when 'FOO' then foo # foo() is a method on the same class
    when 'BAR' then bar # as is bar()
    when 'BAZ' then bar # etc
    else
        # error
    end

And I was hoping to switch it to something a bit more dynamic:

    cmd = get\_string\_from\_requestor
    commands = %w(FOO BAR BAZ QUX QUUX)
    case cmd
    # magic required here: iterate(?) through commands[], match cmd
    # to the commands[i] and then call commands[i].downcase as a
    # method on current class...?
    else
        # error
    end

Anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks!

I am looking for a complete list of the \`struct\`s, \`typedef struct\`s, and functions in Ruby C API and it's body.  


I tried looking up but I found nothing.

I have a string `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet rhgb crashkernel=auto"` which is pretty much shell style variable assignment. I need to process this string so I can extract string within the quotes  `quiet rhgb crashkernel=auto` and then split the options into an array.

I do it this way:

    line = 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet rhgb crashkernel=auto"'
    kernel_opts = line.match(/"(.*)"/).to_s.delete('"').split(' ')

Is there a leaner way to do it?

Is there a way in Ruby to load shell style configuration files naively (without processing them as strings)?

Hi folks,   

Hope everyone is staying safe!

I started learning Ruby-on-Rails framework two weeks before &amp; made a cheat sheet with minimal explanations of different concepts, referred from **Michael Hartl**â€™s "[Learn Web Development with Rails - Fourth Edition](https://www.pdfdrive.com/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-learn-web-development-with-rails-4th-edition-e184254589.html)" tutorials.  

The textbook is really awesome &amp; helped me to build a simple blogging website similar to the basic version of Twitter and the source code is available in github: [https://github.com/ddlogesh/rails-tutorial](https://github.com/ddlogesh/rails-tutorial) 

I would like to share these two cheat sheets, which may be a good start for preparing ruby-on-rails framework or recollect the concepts learned from the above-mentioned textbook.  

Rails: [https://www.notion.so/Ruby-on-Rails-Cheat-Sheet-61106a73031d46ec81c285daaebf1409](https://www.notion.so/Ruby-on-Rails-Cheat-Sheet-61106a73031d46ec81c285daaebf1409)

Ruby: [https://www.notion.so/Ruby-Cheat-Sheet-7c8aabc9268b4e65b5691245dd19068c](https://www.notion.so/Ruby-Cheat-Sheet-7c8aabc9268b4e65b5691245dd19068c)

If you are a beginner to Ruby, please watch this 4-hours tutorial from **freeCodeCamp**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t\_ispmWmdjY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY). Though it's quite a long, it's worth watching it!

Please do share these cheatsheets with your Ruby-on-Rails enthusiasts, who may be interested to learn Ruby-on-Rails.
