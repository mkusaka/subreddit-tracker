Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g9a5sn/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Rust is on my list of things to try and I have read mostly only good things about it. I want to know about downsides also, before trying. Since I have heard learning curve will be steep.

compared to other languages like Go, I don't know how much adoption rust has. But apparently languages like go and swift get quite a lot of criticism. in fact there is a [github repo](https://github.com/ksimka/go-is-not-good) to collect criticisms of Go.

Are there well written (read: not emotional rant) criticisms of rust language? Collecting them might be a benefit to rust community as well.

## [5][Do you actually use variable declaration without initialization.?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ggv2i8/do_you_actually_use_variable_declaration_without/)

This is valid Rust syntax:
```rust
let x;
if condition {
    x = 5;
} else {
    x = 1;
}
```

However, I find that every time I would need to do this, I just bind the `let` to the `if else` directly: 

```rust
let x = if condition {
    5
} else {
    1
};
```

In my opinion, this is both more succinct and more idiomatic. It also leads me to ask the question: are there other Rust features that are allowed but are not used in favor of something better?
## [6][Unzip function slow](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ggy0fa/unzip_function_slow/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ggy0fa/unzip_function_slow/

In an effort to use Rayon more effectively I'm switching over some code to a more functional style, and I noticed an weird regression in performance. With some effort I narrowed it down to the unzip function in the standard library. I created the following benchmark to see the severity of the performance difference:  
    #![feature(test)]
    
    extern crate test;
    use test::{Bencher, black_box};
    
    fn run_functional(l: &amp;Vec&lt;(usize, usize)&gt;) -&gt; (Vec&lt;usize&gt;, Vec&lt;usize&gt;) {
        l.iter().copied().unzip()
    }
    
    fn run_imperative(l: &amp;Vec&lt;(usize, usize)&gt;) -&gt; (Vec&lt;usize&gt;, Vec&lt;usize&gt;) {
        let len = l.len();
        let (mut result1, mut result2) = (Vec::with_capacity(len), Vec::with_capacity(len));
        for item in l.iter().copied() {
            result1.push(item.0);
            result2.push(item.1);
        }
        (result1, result2)
    }
    
    #[bench]
    fn bench_functional(b: &amp;mut Bencher) {
        let list = black_box(vec![(1, 2); 256]);
        b.iter(|| run_functional(&amp;list));
    }
    
    #[bench]
    fn bench_imperative(b: &amp;mut Bencher) {
        let list = black_box(vec![(1, 2); 256]);
        b.iter(|| run_imperative(&amp;list));
    }
This yields the following results:

    test bench_functional ... bench:       1,440 ns/iter (+/- 66)
    test bench_imperative ... bench:         443 ns/iter (+/- 43)

So I dove into the standard library code, and it seems that there are two reasons why the imperative method is so much faster. Firstly, it uses `push` instead of `extend`, which makes a significant difference. The rest of the difference is accounted for by the use of `with_capacity` instead of `new` to create the new vector. This is strange to me, because the `size_hint` function of this iterator returns 256, so Rust knows the size of the resulting vectors it will create. Why is the `with_capacity` function not used and why is `vec.push(a)` so much faster than `vec.extend(Some(a))`?

Hello, I'm excited to share with all of you the [latest Yew release](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/releases/tag/0.16.0) :)

*(If you're not familiar, Yew is a framework for building client web apps with Rust &amp; WebAssembly!)*

It's been awhile since I've shared an update but I'll try to be brief...

**Changes since v0.13**

* Split off `stdweb` support into a convenient alias crate called `yew-stdweb` which allows the main yew crate to default to using `web-sys`.
* Keys can be now be assigned to virtual dom nodes to improve render performance for list-type content.
* Renamed the `mounted(..)` lifecycle callback method to `rendered(..)` which will be called after each time Yew renders your `Component` to the screen.
* Many documentation and project template improvements and updated instructions on how to boot up the many example projects.

Read more: [https://github.com/yewstack/yew/releases](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/releases)

**Other News**

* We moved from Gitter to [Discord](https://discord.gg/VQck8X4) (yay reliable notifications!)
* We [summarized](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/wiki/Dev-Survey-%5BSpring-2020%5D) our [recent dev survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g43ld4/yew_developer_survey/) and used the results to update our [Roadmap](https://yew.rs/docs/more/roadmap). Thank you to the over 100 devs who took the time to share their thoughts and experiences üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* We kickstarted a small bounty program for contributions to Yew on [Issuehunt](https://issuehunt.io/r/yewstack/yew/) (expect to see more funded issues soon!)
* Hooks API / Functional Component development is well under development and is making great progress. Follow along [here](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/projects/3)
* Server Side Rendering is in the planning phase and progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/projects/5). Looking for help on this, please reach out if interested!

Lastly, I want to give a huge thanks to the Yew community which makes this all possible, we had 13 first-time contributors submit bug fixes and features and many others who helped improve docs and maintain examples since the last announcement!

Hey Rustaceans,  
I publish a new version of doh-client. The new big feature is:

* Code was refactored to increase the readability
* DNS packets are parser by the [dns-message-parser](https://crates.io/crates/dns-message-parser) library to check if the packets are correct
* If control-cache is not present in the HTTP header then smallest TTL in the answer section is used to cache the DNS packet
* Socks5 proxy can be used to connect to the server(--socks5)


[Here is the Github link](https://github.com/LinkTed/doh-client)  

Thank you for your attention.
## [12][SAD! a rust cli tool that does batch file edits, no need for sed, we have sad.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ggm067/sad_a_rust_cli_tool_that_does_batch_file_edits_no/)

Hi guys!

https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad

I made my first project in rust, and I thought it would be cool to share it here.

What it does, is basically **ergonomic batch file edits**.

`sad` will take a list of files, a pattern, a replacement, and generate a nice diff of BEFORE / AFTER the edits.

You can view the changes **before** you apply them.


`sad` is inspired by my usage of `sd`, another cool rust project.


The difference as being while `sd` is more optimized for instream edits, such as
 

`command1 | sd '&lt;pattern&gt;' '&lt;replacement&gt;' | command2`


`sad` does batch edits like


`find "$FIND_ARGS" | sad '&lt;pattern&gt;' '&lt;replacement&gt;'`


of course, the output of `sad` is much more optimized for its own usecase:
