Iâ€™m looking for an authentication/session system and having trouble finding repos that use https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss or https://github.com/qor/auth which seem to be the largest, full-featured auth systems for Go. (There are also OAuth2 specific ones like https://github.com/markbates/goth)

Thanks to [sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/volatiletech/authboss/-/blob/authboss.go#L30:21) I was able to find https://github.com/tryy3/webbforum. However, I can't seem to find any other projects using what appears to be the largest auth library: Authboss.

What do we do for Auth in Go? Firebase? OAuth2? LDAP? Or is everything big custom session + cookie + role / ACL + authentication middleware?

Hey All,

Just curious to see if anyone has been able to manage ACLs/ACEs via the golang ldap.v3 module? If so how did you achieve it

Thanks

I want to learn about microservice and its architecture and curious about how to implement a fully featured service. It would help me if you guys could share links to any open source microservice, so that I can learn on my own about microservice by reading their code.
