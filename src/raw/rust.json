But I've spend a few days on this and I'm starting to really worry about my brain, because I'm just getting nowhere.\n\nTo be clear, it's not *lifetimes* that are confusing. They aren't. Anyone who's spent any meaningful time writing C/C++ code understands the inherent problem that Rust solves re: dangling pointers and how strict lifetimes/ownership/borrowing all play a role in the solution.\n\nBut...lifetime annotations, I simply and fully cannot wrap my head around.\n\nAmong other things (reading the book, a few articles, and reading some of Spinoza's ethics because this shit is just about as cryptic as what he's got in there so maybe he mentioned lifetime annotations), I've watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoEX-Vu-R6k), and the presenter gave me hope early on by promising to dive into annotations specifically, not just lifetimes. But...then, just, nothing. Nothing clicks, not even a nudge in the direction of a click. Here are some of my moments of pure confusion:\n\n* At one point, he spams an `'a` lifetime parameter across a function signature. But then it compiles, and he says \"these are wrong\". I have no idea what criteria for correctness he's even using at this point. What I'm understanding from this is that all of the responsibility for correctness here falls to the programmer, who can fairly easily \"get it wrong\", but with consequences that literally no one specifies anywhere that I've seen.\n* He goes on to 'correct' the lifetime annotations...but he does this with **explicit knowledge of the calling context**. He says, \"hey, look at this particular call - one of the parameters here has an entirely different lifetime than the other!\" and then alters the lifetimes annotations *in the function signature* to reflect that particular call's scope context. How is this possibly a thing? There's no way I can account for every possible calling context as a means of deriving the \"correct\" annotations, and as soon as I do that, I might have created an invalid annotation signature with respect to some other calling context.\n* He then says that we're essentially \"mapping inputs to outputs\" - alright, that's moving in the right direction, because the problem is now framed as one of relations between parameters and outputs, not of unknowable patterns of use. But he doesn't explain how they relate to each other, and it just seems completely random to me if you ignore the outer scope.\n\nThe main source I've been using, though, is The Book. Here are a couple moments from the annotations section where I went actually wait what:\n\n\n&gt;We also don\u2019t know the concrete lifetimes of the references that will be passed in, so we can\u2019t look at the scopes...to determine whether the reference we return will always be valid.\n\nOk, so that sort of contradicts what the guy in the video was saying, if they mean this to be a general rule. But then:\n\n&gt; For example, let\u2019s say we have a function with the parameter `first` that is a reference to an `i32` with lifetime `'a`. The function also has another parameter named `second` that is another reference to an `i32` that also has the lifetime `'a`. The lifetime annotations indicate that the references `first` and `second` must both live as long as that generic lifetime.\n\nNow, suddenly, it *is* the programmer's responsibility yet again to understand the \"outer scope\". I just don't understand what business it is of the function signature what the lifetimes are of its inputs - if they live longer than the function (they should inherently do so, right?) - why does it have to have an opinion? What is this informing as far as memory safety?\n\n&gt; The constraint we want to express in this signature is that all the references in the parameters and the return value must have the same lifetime.\n\nThis is now dictatorial against the outer scope in a way that makes no sense to me. Again, why does the function signature care about the lifetimes of its reference parameters? If we're trying to resolve confusion around a returned reference, I'm still unclear on what the responsibility of the function signature is: if the only legal thing to do is return a reference that lives longer than the function scope, then that's all that either I or the compiler could ever guarantee, and it seems like all patterns in the examples reduce to \"the shortest of the input lifetimes is the longest lifetime we can guarantee the output to be\", which is a hard-and-fast rule that doesn't require programmer intervention. At best we could contradict the rule if we knew the function's return value related to only one of the inputs, but...that also seems like something the compiler could infer, because that guarantee probably means there's no ambiguity. Anything beyond seems to me to be asking the programmer, again, to reach out into outer scope to contrive to find a better suggestion than that for the compiler to run with. Which...we could get wrong, again, but I haven't seen the consequences of that described anywhere.\n\n&gt; The lifetimes might be different each time the function is called. This is why we need to annotate the lifetimes manually.\n\nWell, yeah, Rust, that is exactly the problem that *I* have. We have a lot in common, I guess. I'm currently mulling the idea of what happens when you have some sort of struct-implemented function that takes in references that the function intends to take some number of immutable secondary references to (are these references of references? Presumably ownership rules are the same with actual references?) and distribute them to bits of internal state, but I'm seeing this problem just explode in complexity so quickly that I'm gonna not do that anymore.\n\nThat's functions, I guess, and I haven't even gotten to how confused I am about annotations in structs (why on earth would the struct care about anything other than \"these references outlive me\"??) I'm just trying to get a handle on one ask: how the hell do I know what the 'correct' annotations are? If they're call-context derived, I'm of the opinion that the language is simply adding too much cognitive load to the programmer to justify any attention at all, or at least that aspect of the language is and it should be avoided at all costs. I cannot track the full scope context of every possible calling point all the time forever. How do library authors even exist if that's the case?\n\nOf course it isn't the case - people use the language, write libraries and work with lifetime annotations perfectly fine, so I'm just missing something very fundamental here. If I sound a bit frustrated, that's because I am. I've written a few thousand lines of code for a personal project and have used 0 lifetime annotations, partially because I feel like most of the potential use-cases I've encountered present much better solutions in the form of transferring ownership, but mostly because I don't get it. And I just hate the feeling that such a central facet of the language I'm using is a mystery to me - it just gives me no creative confidence, and that hurts productivity.\n\n*edit for positivity: I am genuinely enjoying learning about Rust and using it in practice.

Ever wanted to use newly-stabilized features in a crate or published binary, but decided against it because it would mean bumping the minimum supported Rust version? This is a situation many authors have to deal with, and it's not always clear _when_ to bump the MSRV, even when soundness is an issue (see `mem::uninitialized()` vs `mem::MaybeUninit`).\n\nStandback (from \"standard library\" and \"backport\") helps you out here. It has a minimum supported Rust version of 1.31, and has _a ton_ of APIs that have been backported. Nearly all of this code comes directly from the standard library itself, so it can definitely be trusted. Oh, and it's also `#![no_std]` compatible to a large extent.\n\nIf all you're doing is using a newly stabilized method (not an import), just add `use standback::prelude::*;` to the top of your file. If what you're using is something that must be imported, replace `std` with `standback`. For example, to import the `TryFrom` trait in Rust 1.31: `use standback::convert::TryFrom;`.\n\nStandback will automatically determine the compiler version in use, and will happily re-export an import if it has been stabilized. This ensures that you can confidently use a type even if it has been stabilized \u2014 and do so at nearly zero cost!\n\nHopefully this proves to be a useful project to the Rust community at large. Surprisingly, it actually wasn't too much effort to put this together. I intend on keeping this up-to-date with each Rust release, so the functionality will continue to improve at (nearly) the same speed as `std` :slightly_smiling_face:.

I mean I can always code tests to do this kind of testing myself, but an automated way, using these tools would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7lj", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "fea9ry", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShinoLegacyplayers", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/rust/comments/fea9ry/looking_for_a_number_of_testing_tools/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fea9ry/looking_for_a_number_of_testing_tools/", "subreddit_subscribers": 92716, "created_utc": 1583481183.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "rust", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_3pqnt657", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Found this to be extremely interesting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rust", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_fdzgc8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 84, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 84, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "FlutterDev", "selftext": "For the last weeks, I have spent my time researching the ideal way to embed **Rust** code (or any C compatible language) on **Flutter** **plugins** using the new **FFI** features. \n\n[https://github.com/brickpop/flutter-rust-ffi#readme](https://github.com/brickpop/flutter-rust-ffi#readme)\n\nAfter days and nights of hitting the wall, I've finally come up to a prototype that checks \u2705 all the boxes \ud83d\ude80\n\n* No Swift/Kotlin wrappers\n* No message passing\n* No async/await on Dart\n* Write once, run everywhere\n* No garbage collection\n* Mostly automated development\n\nFeel free to fork it, improve it and give your feedback!
