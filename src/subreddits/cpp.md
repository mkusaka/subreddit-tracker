**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* 🚨 **Updated Remote section.** 🚨 You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [🚨 **Updated!** 🚨 Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

So there are a lot of discussions about c++ memory safety and the fact that google and Microsoft is trying to using other language in the development of browsers like rust. My question is, wouldn’t the use of smart pointer eliminating many of the unsafe-ness of cpp? Why do they want to move entirely to another language?

LEAF is a lightweight error handling library for C++11. Features:

* Efficient delivery of arbitrary error objects to the correct error-handling scope.
* No dynamic memory allocations.
* Compatible with std::error\_code, errno and any other error code type.
* Can be used with or without exception handling.
* Support for multi-thread programming.

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gs7k0q/compilernerd_ci_build_tracking_analysis_for_c/

Two other students and myself are starting a university (**open-source**) group project with the goal of developing a **CI web-app** that **continuously tracks and analyses** fine-grained (e.g. per compilation unit) **build statistics** such as build times, memory usage, template instantiations for C++ projects.

Essentially, this tool would be **integrated into existing CI build systems** with profiling and analysis done on a user-defined basis; e.g. for every (or every arbitrary number) commit(s).

One of our design goals is to have a **drop-in-replacement wrapper compiler**; only requiring a few lines in your build system to change without requiring any modification of the code. We're thinking of **initially exclusively supporting clang** since we are planning on using **Templight** for profiling.

Templight already has many features such as a callgrind output that allows you to visualise and step-through the call graph of the template instantions and their associated cost. We’re not intending to replace this sort of interaction, which is what you should use once the problem is identified and complex code refactoring is necessary. We hope to instead **provide &amp; analyse historical data** so that developers can quickly identify or be notified of specific changes that causes compilation speed, memory usage,... to suffer; i.e. automated analysis &amp; regression testing.

Furthermore, Templight and other profiling tools tend to be overly-complicated; especially “-ftime-report”, which outputs a lot of useless information since it is more tailored to compiler developers. Hence, we’re aiming to be as user-friendly as possible: easy visualisation, sorting and filtering of data. Something which we also think would be very valuable is the ability to compare commits. Done in conjunction with "git diff"ing your code, this would then allow you to quickly see the code modifications that caused the changes. 

For example, it should make it easier for a developer to see if a specific change to a public-facing templated function causes there to be a substantial increase in the number of template instantiations. This may not have an immediate effect on the build times but a few months down the line once the function is frequently used, build times could have dramatically increased. But, by then it may be much harder to refactor.

Better yet, would be the ability to (automatically) predict if changes to a template-heavy library will cause software depending on that library to have build time explosions; e.g. by inter-repo analysis or simply to specify that specific entities are expected to be used very often. Not sure how useful or feasible such a feature would be, just a suggestion for something that could be added in the distant future. More generally, this tool would have the means for inter-repo analysis (which current tools do not offer). We presume such analysis could be useful, but we haven’t worked on any large codebases to know for sure.

**We would greatly appreciate any feature suggestions or critiques, since after all, we are developing this with the hope that you will integrate it into your workflow.**

Hello, iI wanted to ask how you practice data encapsulation of classes. I understand that encapsulation is necessary in many cases, however sometimes it seems unnecessary to write a getValue/setValue method for every data member, especially if the class is used as a c struct to simply store data. 
What are your advices for a good class design?
Encapsulation mandatory? Are mixed approaches (some members encapsulated, others declared public) reasonable and easy to understand?

I made a beginners C++ quiz on telegram for their Educational Quiz Competition. Winners of popular quizzes will get a portion of €400 000! I'd appreciate it if you guys give my quiz a go and leave a comment or review. There's only 30 short multiple choice questions. Thanks!
