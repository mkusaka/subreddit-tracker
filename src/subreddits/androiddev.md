I'll try not to waffle too much as I have a habit of doing so when making posts like this...

Last summer I got *obsessed* with Android launchers. I tried probably 50 of the most popular ones but none of them felt 'right' to me. I'll admit I probably have some form of OCD or Aspergers or something in between.

I decided I wanted to make my own launcher, despite very little experience with app development. While looking at reviews of the [Palm phone](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/palm-palm-phone-1541433790.jpg) (a tiny Android phone that didn't sell very well), I took a liking to the launcher/homescreen and its design became inspiration for my own app, with the intention that it would just be for me and anyone else that stumbled across the project.

Hundreds of hours of coding, designing and a bunch of other challenges later, and I had a working launcher on the Play Store. I got really lucky and some websites/YouTube channels brought attention to it and I started getting a lot of unexpected downloads. I decided to add an in-app upgrade for a couple quid so I could start earning for my work, although I felt a bit reluctant to do so when the app wasn't 100% my original idea. I didn't think anybody would really buy it but it actually started making me more money than my old part-time job did. I kept working on it, taking onboard pretty much any feedback I got, and... long story short I think I burnt myself out with it. I was coding for like 8+ hours a day in my bedroom for 2 or 3 months straight, and I got absolutely fixated over some of its issues. Eventually I took a break from the project, life/studies took over and I no longer have the passion I did when I first started it.

That would be fine, but I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt now. The app is generating quite a lot of money each month despite 0 effort on my part and it's just recently surpassed 150,000 downloads which is absurd. I make it clear all over that it's not a finished product but with the attention now, I feel enormous pressure to keep working on it. I've had a few emails along the lines of "What happened? No update in 6 months..."

I don't have an excuse to *not* work on it now, other than the fact that I don't remember what half of my code does. It's really stressing me out. I'm 19, so I have no idea how really to handle this. My conscious wouldn't let me just take these people's money and run with it, but I also don't know how to go about continuing it. My mental health is shoddy at the best of times and the eat-sleep-code cycle I had last summer didn't do it any favours. The idea of selling the app to another developer/company has crossed my mind but I don't know if that's viable or possible.

Any advice or wisdom regarding this would be super appreciated. Thank you :)
## [5][Where to begin with building a survey app with a database on no budget?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g0gw87/where_to_begin_with_building_a_survey_app_with_a/)

Hi all,

Hope you're all keeping well, especially in these particular times.

I want to try building my first app from scratch that will require a user database as well as list of media (initially I had this in mind as a spreadsheet but thinking it would make more sense as a separate database, too), but have no idea where to start to try to do this all for free and by myself (this is a pet project for myself to use with my friends). I've had a look online and keep find myself pointed towards Airtable, which looks like it'd do the job but, given this is more for me just to tinker around and try out app-development, I don't want to actually invest any money into this project...

Any recommendations? on viable solutions for what I want to do (bit more context below)? Thanks in advance :) 

The idea being the app will survey people on media they like and don't like (e.g. songs, shows, films, etc.) and fill out each media item's response accordingly. However, rather than doing it all in one go (it's a *long* list), this can be done in batches, say 10 items per survey or something, meaning a person can come back and carry on with the remaining items (as well as go back and update previous responses). I have a lot more features in mind but these are the barebone essentials.

## [8][Problem with reading text files from assets folder (Unmarshaling error, Parcelable class)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g0g2uv/problem_with_reading_text_files_from_assets/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g0g2uv/problem_with_reading_text_files_from_assets/

Hi everyone,

I developed my first android app, so i will describe it and the problem briefly...

It's a song book app. The app reads lines from text file that contains numbers and tile of the song then puts that data to an `ArrayList` that is used to set up the `RecyclerView`. When the certain item is clicked it checks for the song number that is in array list item and then based on that opens and reads text from a file that is named for example `23.txt`. I have three languages (menu items) that can be checked in navigation menu, they have click listeners that change the current list for the `RecyclerView.` The problem is that when the third language (menu item) is checked whatever the first item is in the RecyclerView it throws an exception that the file doesn't exist (while it exists in the assets folder, and works for all other items in the list) and occasionally it says (on Samsung Galaxy A8):

    Class not found when unmarshalling: ....
    java.lang.ClassNotFoundException

I tried these solutions on stackoverflow but none of them seem to solve the problem:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13997550/unmarshalling-errors-in-android-app-with-custom-parcelable-classes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13997550/unmarshalling-errors-in-android-app-with-custom-parcelable-classes)

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28589509/android-e-parcel-class-not-found-when-unmarshalling-only-on-samsung-tab3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28589509/android-e-parcel-class-not-found-when-unmarshalling-only-on-samsung-tab3)

So I was wondering if someone would be kind enough to check my code and maybe see what did I do wrong. (Having in mind this is my first "serious" app, a lot of things could be done wrong...)

[https://bitbucket.org/andrejtomas/christiansongbookapp/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/andrejtomas/christiansongbookapp/src/master/)

Currently, I have 2 set of resources (Strings, Images, ...)

&amp;#x200B;

* Portugal Portuguese localization
* Brazil Portuguese localization

I plan to have the following folder

* values-pt-rPT (Contains Portugal Portuguese files)
* values-pt-rBR (Contains Brazil Portuguese files)

But, how about?

1. Do I need to have a folder named "values-pt" ?
2. Should the folder hold Portugal Portuguese files, or Brazil Portuguese files?

Thanks.
