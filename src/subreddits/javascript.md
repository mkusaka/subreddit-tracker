When I go to check out the FUD propaganda and FN there will often be 2 video ads running simultaneously. One of the videos will often be audio only.

How is this accomplished?

Why isn't this violating the terms of service with the video ad providers? They are paying for a video ad, they are only getting audio ads.

How can I block this?
