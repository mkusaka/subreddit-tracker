I'm happy to pay for the book at a later date, once I graduate. I believe in supporting creators, however; I can't afford the book and really itching to work through it this weekend.  


It's a shot in the dark but if anyone is willing to help, I would be forever grateful.

[Hey guys so in rspec I get an error on the first picture but not on the second picture. The if statement is checking for true or false then moving onto \\"check in successful\\" I don't understand why you don't have to call the .add\_occupant method again after the if statement to actually complete the task. That \\"if\\" line doesn't actually complete the method does it? If so, why?

Hi,

I get that Ruby is all dynamic and proud of it, but how the heck am I to know what is the preferable way to access/set arrays? the same goes for a lot of operations...

Here my array annotations:

&amp;#x200B;

    a = [1, ["a", "b"], 4] \\ arr[1][0] \\ arr.dig(3,0) \\ value_at, a[2,3] = .. \\ 
    
    a[2..3] \\ slice, a.[]=(0, "first") \\ a.[](2) \\ %w(a b c) \\ %W({a} b c) \\ .to_ary \\ .to_arr

edit: I forgot `[1,2][0] \\ &lt;&lt; \\ unshift(0) \\ push(1,2,3)`

It should be renamed to Ruby++ or even better Common Ruby :)

Thanks!

How do I get usable certificates for creating a simple document signing app using the below libraries? PSPDFKit for annotating the PDF with an ink signature, then Origami for applying a digital signature to the PDF.

I tried to buy an Adobe approved trustlist cert, but they only offer them on USB and and try to charge me 10x as much for aws cloudhsm support. and aws cloudhsm is super expensive as well.

How am I supposed to do this? Am I barking up the wrong tree with aws cloudhsm?
