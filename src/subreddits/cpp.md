Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

[eCAL](https://github.com/continental/ecal) is a  modern C++ interprocess communication framework designed for low latency and massive data throughput. It was developed by a Continental R&amp;D team to manage distributed high performance computing for autonomous driving prototyping cars.

The API design is inspired by [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) but it has built in shared memory transport from the start and supports modern message protocols like [Google Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) or [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) (infinitely fast ;-)).

Finally there are some powerful applications for monitoring, recording and replaying the whole interprocess communication in a distributed manner.

Hello all, first of all I just want to say that I am not a professional C++ developer. Instead, my major is in Electrical Engineering and doing PhD in Optics. During midway of my PhD, I discover that I am more interested in programming such as hardware programming  FPGA/Micro-porcessor and software programming than lens and mirrors. I am currently working at NASA for my PhD but I want to looking for opportunity in the industry sector for software development internship. To beef-up my resume, I developed this package and hope that it can help me to get interview. I come here to look for feedback and criticism for improvement. Here is the Github link

[https://github.com/dante2608/Parallel-CRC](https://github.com/dante2608/Parallel-CRC)

Follow-up question: After looking my project, can you tell if I am competent enough to  get internship those companies from tech-hub at San Fransisco. I want to have a reference to balance between grindding leetcode or spending more time doing personal project.

Thank you for your time
