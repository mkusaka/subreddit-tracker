We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Is there a specific typescript tutorial any of you would recommend that has a strong focus on using Typescript with React? My search so far resulted in mutliple options with all having a different approach as to how Typescript should be ideally used with React. Something beginner friendly would be amazing - similar to the Redux doc.

My background is more data science/ML related, so I'm more comfortable with python and SQL. I was just wondering, for people who've either hired front-end developers or been hired, what are good coding challenge formats/exercises to test someone's coding ability? I've looked at a few websites that advertise "50 Best Javascript Interview Questions", but was wondering if there's more to them?

I was making an electron app with react for fun, and it worked fine while I was building it as i was loading `localhost:1234` instead of an html file.

But when I react files and then ran electron from the html file, the images wouldn't load properly.

How would I fix this?

## [12][How to render google maps "navigation beam"](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f7qgio/how_to_render_google_maps_navigation_beam/)

Hello, I'm working on a project with a map component where you can track objects moving around a map. I want each object to display  a directional component like the blue dot on the google maps app, to show which direction it is heading. Something like this: [https://gyazo.com/bc3a590e0f508fd800deec44c8c190a0](https://gyazo.com/bc3a590e0f508fd800deec44c8c190a0) 

Is there a proper name for this effect? I feel like it's surely already implemented out there, but I can't seem to find anything on it.

Thanks!
