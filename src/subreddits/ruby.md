Hi! I hope everyone is fine,  
I have a task in which I have to implement CKEditor in rails, My work is from the backend side so I have to implement this on my API , After searching many tutorials I find each for the monolithic structure but just not for API,    
Maybe it is easy just for API but I don't know how to do it &amp; how it works with API?    
Can anyone please guide me?  or show me the path to implement this?

Hello, Everyone. 

I am currently working on something out of boredom at work, and I am running into a wall. 

I am trying to create a password manager using Ruby. I am trying to set it to where I can input a master password, and it will validate it meets requirements. I have it set to require minimum of 8 characters (got this figured out using .length), an uppercase and lower case character and a special character.

My question is, what is the best way to validate that a variable (string) has an upper and lowercase character, and a special character?

I have published a few old of my old Ruby articles at Medium. Here is the "friends link" so you can view the article without a membership.

One of the things I used Ruby for is my “home-grown” CMS or content management system. To make things easy, I use a hash file of md5 checksums to be able to tell what files have changed in my output directory so I can tell what to upload and what to delete off of the web server.

Part 1 - Create File checkpoints using Ruby and MD5

[https://medium.com/@bradtrupp/create-file-checkpoints-using-ruby-and-md5-63e49ca9ba6c?source=friends\_link&amp;sk=dec812a0fe186a09cad6b29ad67bc651](https://medium.com/@bradtrupp/create-file-checkpoints-using-ruby-and-md5-63e49ca9ba6c?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dec812a0fe186a09cad6b29ad67bc651)

Part 2 Check for File Changes using Ruby and MD5

[https://medium.com/@bradtrupp/check-for-file-changes-using-ruby-and-md5-1ddf9a400a9f?source=friends\_link&amp;sk=4c41ab2dfab0f3fd0c39cbba7faca84c](https://medium.com/@bradtrupp/check-for-file-changes-using-ruby-and-md5-1ddf9a400a9f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=4c41ab2dfab0f3fd0c39cbba7faca84c)

This simplified example in these articles show what has changed. In my full custom CMS code, it also does the FTP uploads and deletions. 

It was all done via command line., Publishing a new blog entry was just handful of command line commands to generate, preview, upload, and create a new checkpoint.
