Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

A month ago I got a new job as an android developer, before you congratulate me I've something important to tell. I'm not a CS major, I read Java and gradually got myself acquainted with the skill to develop android app.

At job interview, the interviewer got impressed by my determination and the team decided to hire me.

So here I'm all surrounded by CS majors, these people are great, helpful and supportive. Also I feel very comfortable working so far. 

But every now and then whenever I listen them talking about other languages and some more technical stuff and start judging myself and think do I even belong here, I'm stupid, I'll be thrown away and keep on demotivating myself.

Currently I do keep myself updated with what's happening in the developer community and everything else but I'm afraid, I might end up burning my motivation down.

Please help me how I can be a better developer, improve my skill and boost my confidence.

Thanks in Advance. :)
## [4][My thoughts about Google Play and policy support team](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/eq07eu/my_thoughts_about_google_play_and_policy_support/)

Hello everyone, I want to tell about my problem with Google Play. Around a year ago I published an app (com.msw.pornblocker), a blocker for adult content websites. I issued an update on 12.01.2020 (changed an icon and uploaded a new APK version), and after that my app was suspended with a statement: “Violation of Sexually Explicit Content policy”. I filed an appeal and received a reply, that my app still violates Google Play Policy.  
 Reply also contained the [screenshot](https://imgur.com/NuG3xy3) from my app’s description in Google Play. This screenshot shows how black list function works, I purposely used filters to hide full URLs. My answer was: "...as you can see I've used filters and there is no way to find out the correct urls of the websites", I've written that I can remove the screenshot or replace it, but I don't have access to my app. After that, I've got the answer: "As much as I'd like to help, I’m not able to provide any more information or a better answer to your question. In our previous email, I made sure to include all the information available to me." 

And then I realised that most probably I’m talking to a bot, it felt like a nightmare. I would never believe that such decisions can be taken by a some automatic algorithm, and appeals are processed by a bot, but it has happened. When I think about it, I immediately remember the episode from the Lexx series released on 1997 with automatic judge and lawyer. 

My app was approved with exactly the same screenshots a year ago, and now it was removed without any warnings. I could resolve the issue with just 2 clicks, but nobody cares. 

Let’s understand, why was the app suspended? Apparently, during this year Google revised their apps check algorithm and perceived that my screenshot violates their policy. Why haven’t I received any warnings before I got suspended? 

Obviously, this algorithm is unable to check all published apps, and kicks off when new version is released or any updates are made, in order to save the resources. For the same purpose appeals are replied with auto-generated messages.

It means that current system works as such: you publish an application, an algorithm checks and approves it, for a while you do not release any updates, during this time algorithm gets revised, you publish updates and get suspended by a revised algorithm without any warnings, you file an appeal and get an auto-generated message with an information what exactly has to be corrected, you write an answer where you clarify that you cannot make changes as an app is suspended, and then again receive an auto-generated reply that they can’t help you.

I believe Google understands what they are doing, they understand that sometimes they deprive people of means for living, however suspensions still keep happening automatically, though in my opinion such decision can have a big impact on developer’s life and shall be taken by a human.

Ok, even if it’s like this, then at least appeals shall be processed by a human, and in shortest terms? Unfortunately, not. My app was suspended 5 days ago, and I didn’t receive any clear reply up to now. 

I think my mistake was to use Google Pay for subscriptions, after suspension my subscription plans were removed, and now every day users whose payment shall occur get their subscriptions cancelled. If I used the stripe as payment processor, I just would not have to pay 30% from the earnings and old subscriptions would retain. 

This is how a single automatic action can make you lose 1/3 of your income. What can do a company which encounter this? To ask their lawyer to write an appropriate letter and send it to Google, take some other legal actions to restore an app.   
 What I can do? Absolutely nothing, I can only talk to bots, wait for reply and day by day watch how I’m losing my clients.   
 Maybe you think that before developing or publishing the app you can ask a policy team, something like: “I want to develop an app with a function… won’t it violate your policy?” or “If I post this screenshot in the description, won’t I get suspended?”   
 Of course, you can ask, but you will receive an answer like this: “As much as I'd like to help, unfortunately, I'm not able to comment on your planned implementation. Pre-compliance check is not allowed.” Then you issue updates and get suspended, and nobody cares of your future. Maybe it depends on the number of users and profits that you bring to the company, if it’s so then it’s a nightmare. I don’t think that other companies are better, I just think that it’s good to be more humane to those who help your company earn money.

## [6][Creating a timeout button animation](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/eq07i3/creating_a_timeout_button_animation/)

One of the features in waze uses a sort of timeout button where if the button is not pressed for a certain duration, it times out, and proceeds with that action. Look at the 'Go now' button in this video https://gfycat.com/quarrelsomesaneguernseycow

I am looking to create something similar for an android material components button. So far my thoughts are to create a vector path of the white outline near the perimeter of the button and animate the trimStartPath property of the vector.

Looking for some other ideas since I have not ventured into these type of animations before

i dropped my phpne into water and shortly after it it was frozen. after a hard reboot (holding the power button) the lock screen appeared but the display is not working and therefore I cannot unlock into Credential Encrypted (CE) storage (what I need to access my photos of the day, which are really important).

is there a way to access storage without unlocking? is there a way to unlock by using a usb mouse via usb otg adapter or something like this?

now,it seems the phone is still powered on but the display is black and I don't see anything and the buttons are not working as well.

it is a pixel 3 (so it should has been waterproof by the way) and I think it does not support HDMI video output?

any ideas how to get my files? if o could get it past the direct boot screen, Google photos should do it's backup which would be enough?

I really like the new wellbeing - focus mode that disables certain apps. Now I was wondering if there is any way to enable/disable it programatically?

Maybe it is just me, but I just feel squeamish about following best practices in Android, LITERALLY as they are practiced. 

I am in love with Kotlin for being the beautiful, elegant language that it is, but still there are some codes that look boilerplate-y and ugly that I try to steer away from using.

Maybe it is my peculiar quirk, but I always, always try to make my code be as simple, minimalist, and **human readable** as possible. I am not fond of plastering whole paragraphs of // comments either. I prefer making code that I can read and instantly understand even after I had put aside the app for months. 

Would this alienate me from getting jobs? Because I see a lot of the code written by other developers look ugly and violate a lot of the principles I have read on Clean Code, if you guys are familiar with that book.
