I just released v1.0.0 of my latest project, [oneshot](https://github.com/raphaelreyna/oneshot) which was born out of frustration of all the hoops I sometimes had to jump through sometimes to do a simple file transfer.

I'd love to get your feedback on the project or answer any questions you may have. Thanks!

Hello, 

I'm new to GO and I am looking for a great tutorial to understand how to create a REST API with a postgresql db, do you have any tutorials that you recommend? 

I have been looking on youtube and go blogs but I can't find something that really explains me how Go works.

Thanks for your help and I'm really looking forward to join the go community!

I was at Twitter and saw [this](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1276670553584095233?s=20) post from rakyll, but what caught my attention was actually the [comment](https://twitter.com/_mfridman/status/1276676207380135936?s=20) and it kept me wondering how many nice projects that I'm missing that could improve my Go projects.

For sure tparse will be on my Go projects, any other recommendations?
## [6][Is Go well suited to replace the C programming lang for UNIX userspace programs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/hh5kh9/is_go_well_suited_to_replace_the_c_programming/)

Basically the question. Is golang mature and suitable enough so that newer programs can be favorably written in Go, instead if C? I am not talking about rewriting the kernel - just user programs.

Just found this a few days ago while searching for GUI implementations.

They use a video game library (raylib). Pretty creative.

 When you don't feel like coding but you just want to code. So I created a little script to automate creating a new project folder [https://github.com/ykcab/gonew/tree/master](https://github.com/ykcab/gonew/tree/master).  
It was really just for fun.
