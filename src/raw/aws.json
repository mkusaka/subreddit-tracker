Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.

For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.\n\nFor what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.\n\n*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.

The SEC makes available a file each quarter that contains a list of all SEC filings, including 13F filings.\n\n* The file is called the `Master Index of EDGAR Dissemination Feed`\n* The file contains the following fields: `CIK|Company Name|Form Type|Date Filed|Filename`\n* There are about 200,000+ filings per quarter, \\~6,000 of which are 13F filings\n* This file will be uploaded to an S3 bucket (`feed_bucket`) that triggers a Lambda function (`feed_lambda`)\n\n1. `feed_lambda` parses the Quarterly file and sends messages to an SQS Queue\n\n* The messages sent to SQS contain the information from each row that is a 13F filing: `CIK` (an company index), `Company Name`, `Form Type` (there are some variants to 13F filings), `Date Filed` and `Filename`\n* `Filename` is the location of the 13F filing on `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/`, for example `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000097/0001000097-19-000001.txt`.\n* SQS messages are processed by by a lambda function called `save_filing`\n\n1. `save_filing` fetches 13F filings from `sec.gov` and saves these raw files to S3\n\n* The `save_filing` Lambda function process up to 10 SQS messages at a time.\n* `save_filing` saves raw `.txt` file filings to a `filings` S3 bucket that triggers a `process_filing` Lambda function.\n\n1. `process_filing` uses regular expressions and Python's native XML parsing library to read the filing data\n\n* Each filing contains a list of holdings that are read into a `namedtuple`. Additional processing, cleaning and validation are done for each holding listed in the given 13F filing.\n* To save the cleaned holdings, I'm unsure of which option would the best fit. Some options I have considered are listed below:\n\n## Options for storing 13F data\n\n1. Store each holding as an Item in DynamoDB\n\n* I think that getting data in to DynamoDB would be easy, but there's no easy way to export the full set of items from **DynamoDB** (possibly over 100 million items)\n* I haven't used DynamoDB before and I'm interested in trying it out.\n\n1. Save holding data to CSV files stored in an S3 bucket and export the data using a `select *` query on **AWS Athena**\n\n* This could be a good option, but I would have lots of small files which might not be optimal for use with Athena\n* The speed of the query to export data is not super important, but the size of the dataset is nowhere close to the petabyte scale that Athena can handle\n\n1. Store data in **Aurora Postgres Serverless**\n\n* I'm familiar with Postgres, but I'm not sure if I need it\n* This would also involve a VPC which would make things slightly more complicated, I think\n\nAs I mentioned above, my goal is to export large CSV with all 13F holding data that I can use in a Business Intelligence tool such as Google Data Studio, Tableau or Qlik.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on how best to store data for this project?", "author_fullname": "t2_2awy1sgp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Looking for advice on how best to store data in a serverless project: DynamoDB, Athena/S3 or Aurora Postgres Serverless", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aws", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"z4uoyr7hyob51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z4uoyr7hyob51.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e014352389cd4efa9a694bf2f05e97a1fadedf15"}, {"y": 113, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z4uoyr7hyob51.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24e65e199bcfbf3aff3a641d4e51786b609015ad"}, {"y": 168, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z4uoyr7hyob51.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=392e74861781552a671ddf00a1322b5f1b46f4fe"}, {"y": 337, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z4uoyr7hyob51.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5cbeab51baf200214713537b777d1c807f9a99"}], "s": {"y": 401, "x": 761, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/z4uoyr7hyob51.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2fcf2fea3a9742cfe09ed8de08441792162a11"}, "id": "z4uoyr7hyob51"}}, "name": "t3_htpjzi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "serverless", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1595140165.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.aws", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a question about a project I&amp;#39;m doing to learn more about serverless technologies on AWS.
