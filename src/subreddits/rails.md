I really like tailwindcss, and im thinking of getting tailwindui. It would save me alot of time in the design process. Anyone working with tailwindui? How has it changed your productivity?

Hi all, I'm fairly new to Rails but experienced in other languages.

Something I'm finding difficult is testing in Rails. Out of the box there are just so many types of tests and so I have so many questions.

1) MiniTest or RSpec? Every project I've seen in my career has used RSpec, do I really need to learn both?

2) Why so many types of spec? Request specs, controller specs, model specs, job specs, service specs, I've probably missed some! Do I need to learn them all? 

How? 

Not to sound petty but the RSpec documentation website is one of the worst websites I've ever encountered with regards to the volume of information on there (not much). I say this as someone who has had to learn and digest other testing frameworks in other languages such as PHP and JS.

3) Shoulda? Or shouldn't? I keep seeing Shoulda popup in projects but then friends tell me "DON'T USE THAT CRAP". Is it good to use or not? If not, why not?

4) Factory bot? Is this bad? Similar to Shoudla, people seem to dislike it.

5) Are there any decent resources out there with plenty of examples of how to write good tests, in the most recent syntax with modern tools? I keep seeing examples online with "the old RSpec syntax" showing something like `obj.stub()`

6) Do you all really, actually T,D,D? As in, you honestly, 100%, seriously write tests first, then code, then refractor, etc? Everyone I've met in my Rails career journey says they like to TDD but then in practice when pairing or whatever, they go guns blazing writing or debugging code without even looking at the tests until later.

7) Any other wisdom you can offer with regards to being a testing ninja? It's already confusing enough with all of the various _types_ of tests (unit, integration, feature, end to end, etc) but then Rails adds another level of complexity for me with all of the various styles and syntaxes and stuff.

Thanks in advance!

Hey guys... I‚Äôve been trying to integrate an authentication system to verify if a given user is in fact a student from my university. I‚Äôm having a really hard time finding a good documentation on it. 

I looked into omniauth and it seems like the way to go but I‚Äôm super confused on how to integrate it with my university login. Does anyone here have any experience with integrating such a custom verification system?

A week or so ago, a video about making a Twitter Clone with Rails CableReady and StimulusReflex hit the web. While I think it is really cool what those teams are doing, I am a little more old school (in JS years &lt;/sarcasm&gt;) and just use React.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured you all would like to see a tutorial on a clone of the clone with React and bare ActionCable

Hi Everyone.

I am currently trying to implement acts\_as\_votable in generic controller. (VotesController)

I am planning to send contentType and contentId parameters to votes controller.  First, i'll find the model class by using contentType parameter, then ContentTypeResultModel.find(contentId). Everntually will get the original model I need, 

Then i'll implement the voting.

Is there any solution in Rails to accomplish this, or do I need to create controller method for each content type?

Hope I explained clearly.

## [12][Query Problem Possible on ActiveRecord or Low Level Query?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/gd4rap/query_problem_possible_on_activerecord_or_low/)

I have table A, B and C.

A has many B and C is a category of B (B has an a\_id and B has a c\_id).

Let's say I want to query all A's and its corresponding B's based on selected C's. B has a date field so it is a possible that a record in A can have multiple B's of the same C. Example:

A with id 1 has 2 B records (1, 2) with dates January 2020 and February 2020 as well as the same C\_id 1. If I select C with id 1, it should give me record A with id 1 and only B with id 2 since it has the latest date value.

Wondering if this is possible with ActiveRecord or do I have to do a manual query?
