**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

## [4][ASIO makes for a bloated Networking standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h0954a/asio_makes_for_a_bloated_networking_standard/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h0954a/asio_makes_for_a_bloated_networking_standard/

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I've run benchmarks of various networking solutions for some years and decided to get some real numbers for ASIO, as this will be the basis for standard C++ event-loops and networking for decades to follow.

&amp;#x200B;

C++ is a language that makes its dent in the world by being fast, optimizable and of higher quality runtime wise than say, scripted things. So for things to get standardized they should at least pass basic benchmark requirements IMO. What kind of performance is sane, and what is not?

&amp;#x200B;

If the Linux kernel with BSD socket interfaces can perform IPC between two processes over network at 250k "messages" per second, then it makes sense for a C++ wrapper of such TCP foundations to be somewhat close to this number. To retain the performance of the underlying platform in a reasonable way.

&amp;#x200B;

My testing shows that while you can absolutely retain this performance with C++ using these BSD socket interfaces, ASIO has a significant performance loss **retaining only 80% of the underlying platform** foundations. You're down to 199k with the most basic echo server one could make (no web protocols or anything implemented, just from wrapping).

&amp;#x200B;

These 80% are measured using the [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1\_36\_0/doc/html/boost\_asio/example/echo/async\_tcp\_echo\_server.cpp](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/boost_asio/example/echo/async_tcp_echo_server.cpp) basic TCP echo server. There shouldn't be any significant performance loss for such a basic application. I'm no expert in ASIO, and I reserve the case that I could be entirely wrong here, but this example file looks very slim and simple, yet it doesn't measure up to the standards we already have had for 40 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Some would argue that interfaces have no relation to performance, but what is Vulkan vs. OpenGL then? They are both interfaces, both standards, and they perform vastly differently as one has a mandated validation layer while the other has an optional layer. There are other differences, sure, but the main point is that **an interface has performance characteristics no matter what vendor** implementation you use. The gaming industry knows this very well.

&amp;#x200B;

For something so important and fundamental it would make sense, in my mind, to show actual proof that there can be an implementation of such an ASIO interface that actually does retain close to 100% of the performance as given by the underlying platform, before that interface gets standardized. Otherwise, fragmentation will follow as every one different database, client library, server will use their own event-loop instead, as they are working uphill using the standard thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore I know from other memory benchmarks that ASIO sockets are close to 700 bytes in user space memory, while things like libuv is 160 bytes and other things like h2o has 90 byte sockets while lwan and others have 40 byte ones. ASIO is the most bloated in this measurement.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, that's what I wanted to get said. If nobody cares, that's fine.

Hi,

We have a development system where we open a connection to a server and in the OpenRequest method I have not added the INTERNET\_FLAG\_SECURE parameter and when we call the SendRequest method, it will throw an exception with code 12152. But same code in production has not caused issues in some scenarios.  WinInet API.

Can anyone explain a few things:

1. What is INTERNET\_FLAG\_SECURE?
2. What is error code 12152 and when is it thrown?
3. Is there any scenario where the 12152 error will not be thrown even when the INTERNET\_FLAG\_SECURE is ***not*** passed to OpenRequest function?

Also, if i use the URL with https, it throws another error 12007.

I request everyone not to post the description from MSDN. I did not understand it and hence i come here to understand it in near to layman terms.

I'm new in c++ programming. I want to know which libraries to learn as a beginner and also want to know how to get started into open source as a cpp developer.
I also wanted to know about kde, and nodeJs and chrome v8 engine.

SYCL is an open standard developed by the Khronosâ„¢ Group that enables  developers to write code for heterogeneous systems using standard C++. 

 [ISO C++ and SYCL Join for the Future of Heterogeneous Programming](https://www.codeplay.com/portal/06-09-20-iso-cpp-and-sycl-join-for-the-future-of-heterogeneous-programming)  


by Michael Wong, Codeplay Software

"SYCL was designed from the ground up to be ISO C++ first, then augmented with heterogeneous support"  
Michael  Wong has written aboud how SYCL is evolving and aligning with ISO C++  to bring portable heterogeneous programming to all.

 So to clarify a little more currently myself and a group of friends from college are developing some applications for web and mobile, it's been a ton of fun and their guys are fantastic at what they do but since I'm primarily interested in game development and C++ I take the role of project management but I would love if for the next project I could contribute using C++ somehow.

I was thinking about potentially the ability to write a library in C++ but I'm really still new to it myself so I thought I'd see if anyone had any experience with it, possibly would anyone know if it's rather difficult to integrate or even feasible at all? Any advice would be great, thanks a million in advance! :)

I wrote this little utility for myself. Really happy with performance :) so far. Throughput on my notebook (i7 macbook) is 50k - 60k files / second.

Not a professional C++ developer so anyone has feedback on the source, that'd be nice.

The blog post goes over architecture and aggregation logic in detail, as does the README on the repo. Used boost::filesystem and AppKit for the GUI; not much more.
