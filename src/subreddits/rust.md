Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hurj77/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Redmonk's biannual language popularity analysis was just published, and Rust places at 20th: [https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/07/27/language-rankings-6-20/](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/07/27/language-rankings-6-20/)

Other popular listings:

* [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) \- 18th
* [PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) \- 18th
* [IEEE Spectrum 2020](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2020) \- 20th
* [Stack Overflow survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) \- 19th

While any one of these can be thought only as a single datapoint with it's associated biases and uncertainty, I think that together they tell a coherent story: Rust is a reasonably popular, "top 20", language in year 2020. While this has nothing to do with the capabilities of the language itself, this fact might be helpful to convince colleagues and bosses to adopt the language at workplaces where it makes sense.

Hello everyone! I've been trying to learn rust over the past few months. I saw that \`starship.rs\` had a really cool domain name so I went and looked for one myself. Realized the registrars are expensive and not that reputable.

So I bought [cli.rs](https://cli.rs). I made a way where anyone can use it. You just need to make a PR to this repo: [https://github.com/zackify/cli.rs](https://github.com/zackify/cli.rs) and the CNAME record for any subdomain will be created for you.

Hope this is okay to post here, I don't get anything out of this, and just thought it was a cool idea :)
