I've been working on an online store (just the front end) using react. Is this considered a very simple and easy project? Or would it impress employers?

Hi React community.   


I'm currently working on a Frankenstein app. Basically we want to display live data from a canbus source.   
To do this we stiched together:  
\- a Python module that communicate in canbus with our electronic and send the data to Electron via Socket IO 

\-an Electron backend for the app that communicate the data to the frontend via IPC

\-a React frontend to look sexy that show Plotly graphs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have a good prototype walking on its 2 feets but it's clearly not scalable.  


Currently the framerate is limited to once every 100ms for the amount of graphs (and there are about 5 graphs with 10 to 50K points each) is limited to 5.

If we try to increase both of those parameter the whole application start to stutter. To manage the refresh i'm using this hook i found on the web : [https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)  


Also the data that needs to be displayed are aggregated on each page that they are needed. This makes the code very hard to maintain with a  lot of dirty copy past.   


I don't expect you guys to look at my code. However do you any similar project that I could look at ?   


Subsequent question, would Redux be of any help to centralize all the data sent by the Python module or have i understood that wrong ?  


I hope i'm not all over the place :(
