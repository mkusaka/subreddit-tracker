I discovered a security issue in the kaminari gem. I would advise you all to update to the latest version.

Hey there!

First of all - the story below is super simplified version of what is really needed. I simplified it to make it easier to understand what i need and to make this post shorter.

I'm developing an app, in which user can upload a CSV file (there is no any standard format of it) and records imported this way are saved in a database as a \`User\` record.

User of that system is able to configure which csv columns should be matched to which database columns of a record. Right now, i'm just storing such config as a key-value hash in a following format:  


    {
      'db_column_1' =&gt; 'csv_column_1',
      'db_column_2' =&gt; 'csv_column_2',
    }

as it works pretty well and is really simple, i need to extend that by adding a feature which would let user define a more complicated mappings, like multiple CSV columns put in the same record column. What first came to my mind was using jinja/handlebars-like engine so config hash would look as follows:  


    {
      'db_column_1' =&gt; '{{ csv_column_1 }}',
      'db_column_2' =&gt; '{{ csv_column_2 }} {{ csv_column_3 }}',
    }

Using jinja/handlebars would be an obvious overkill as a regular \`gsub\` will be enough but, there is one more thing i need - filters. (as an example) sometimes CSV has a timestamp column and i would need some sort of modifier feature to make it able to convert incoming values (pseudocode):

    {
      'db_column_1' =&gt; '{{ csv_column_1 | timestamp_to_datetime }}'
    }

Given eveyrthing above - is there any go-to and well known lib for doing such smart "token" replacements in a handlebars/jinja style? I feel like jinja/handlebars is an overkill, especially that sometimes such CSV file has 60k (!!) records in it.  


Thanks in advance for any clues!
