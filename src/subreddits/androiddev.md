This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [3][Android Studio Emulator killed by Riot Vanguard](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gdr6pj/android_studio_emulator_killed_by_riot_vanguard/)

Just an FYI to anyone who has Riot Vanguard installed as a part of Valorant-- When Vanguard is active it will immediatly terminate your Android Emulation even with a Cold Boot. 

I spent 4 hours pulling my hair out and ultimately uninstalled every package as well as all of Android Studio and didn't see any fix. My emulator was being killed with an error code 0 and no other logs.

I finally randomly disabled Riot Vanguard because I remembered reading it had kernel level permissions to block certain drivers and the second that I disabled it, my emulation worked perfectly normal.

If anyone is seeing their emulation randomly die who also has Vanguard installed, please give this a shot and let me know if it works.

So my company would like us to try and implement these services on a parallel build to target users which don't have the Google Play Services on their devices. Anyone has any feedback on using them? What should I expect? Is it worth the effort?

The menu items can be clicked again after navigating to the destination fragment. This just ends up recreating that fragment.

Once I am on the destination fragment how do I disable the menu item for this fragment on the navigation drawer?

I am looking for some good 3rd party GitHub apps to improve my workflow. Something which catches sudden increase in apk size, addition of unoptimized images, missing string translations, and lint checks. I have faced all these issues before. Any recommendations?
