Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f8ney8/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Welcome once again to the official /r/rust Who's Hiring thread!

Before we begin, job-seekers should also remember to peruse [the prior thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ecxd62/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

This thread will be periodically stickied to the top of /r/rust for improved visibility. The thread will be refreshed and posted anew when the next version of Rust releases in six weeks.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting (adapted from /r/cpp's jobs thread).

#### Rules for individuals:

* Don't create top-level comments; those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with on-topic questions.
* I will create a stickied top-level comment for individuals looking for work.
* I will create an additional top-level comment for meta discussion.

#### Rules for employers:

* To find individuals seeking work, see the replies to the stickied top-level comment; you will need to click the "more comments" link at the bottom of the top-level comment in order to make these replies visible.
* To make a top-level comment you must be hiring directly; no third-party recruiters.
* One top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* Proofread your comment after posting it and edit it if necessary to correct mistakes.
* Please base your comment on the following template:

COMPANY: *[Company name; please link to your company's website or careers page.]*

TYPE: *[Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]*

DESCRIPTION: *[What does your company do, and what are you using Rust for? How much experience are you seeking and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details the better.]*

LOCATION: *[Where are your office or offices located? If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]*

REMOTE: *[Do you offer the option of working remotely? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]*

VISA: *[Does your company sponsor visas?]*

I am trying to port codes from these posts

1. [https://turreta.com/2019/09/21/rest-api-with-rust-actix-web-and-postgresql-part-1/](https://turreta.com/2019/09/21/rest-api-with-rust-actix-web-and-postgresql-part-1/)
2. [https://turreta.com/2019/09/21/rest-api-with-rust-actix-web-and-postgresql-part-2/](https://turreta.com/2019/09/21/rest-api-with-rust-actix-web-and-postgresql-part-2/)
3. [https://turreta.com/2019/09/21/rest-api-with-rust-actix-web-and-postgresql-part-3/](https://turreta.com/2019/09/21/rest-api-with-rust-actix-web-and-postgresql-part-3/)

to Actix-Web 2.0 and Postgres 0.17.2 but I get the error 'Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime.' when this line runs:

`let mut client = Client::connect(pg_connection_string, NoTls) .unwrap();`

Are there ways around this without changing the codes too much?  I spent the whole Sunday trying to fix this but to no avail.

These are some he new codes:

**Main.rs**

    ...
    #[get("/persons/{id}")]
    async fn get_person(info: web::Path&lt;(i32)&gt;) -&gt; impl Responder {
        let mut vec:Vec&lt;person::common::Person&gt; = Vec::new();
    	person::get_person_by_id(&amp;mut vec, info.into_inner());
    	return web::Json(vec);
    }
    ...
    
    #[actix_rt::main]
    async fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
        HttpServer::new(move || {
    		App::new()
    			.service(get_person)
    			.service(delete_person)
    			.service(update_person)
    			.service(get_person_list)
    			.service(create_person)
    			})
    			.bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    			.run()
    			.await
    }
    ...

**person/mod.rs**

    pub fn get_person_by_id(vec: &amp;mut Vec&lt;common::Person&gt;, id: i32) {
        let mut client = Client::connect(pg_connection_string, NoTls).unwrap();
    	
    	for row in &amp;client.query("SELECT person_id, person_name FROM persons WHERE person_id = $1", &amp;[&amp;id]).unwrap() {
    	    let person = common::Person { 
    				person_id: row.get(0),
                                    person_name: row.get(1)
                             };
    	    vec.push(person);
    	}
    }

Thanks!

Which crate would you recommend to define custom errors if you have to start a new rust project today? And why?

I know and used the following:
* [error-chain](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/error-chain)
* [failure](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure)
* [snafu](https://github.com/shepmaster/snafu)
* [thiserror](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror)
