Apologies if this is a stupid question but I am looking to create a simple web app that makes API calls....But the twist here is I have python scripts that call that endpoints, pass all the correct authorization tokens etc before presenting my JSON out on my command line .... 

So i am wondering is it possible to somehow create a simple react app where a user can click a button, but that button in the "background" executes that python script and presents the data on screen?

We are searching for front-end developers with **React** skills. **Data visualization experience is a bonus!**

We are Climate Mind ‚Äì [www.climatemind.org](http://www.climatemind.org/) and we are building a tool that communicates to users how climate change personally affects them. How the things they care about are affected and gives attractive solutions that align with users' world view, lifestyle, identity, skillset, location and more.

This is an international team of volunteers who are alarmed about climate change. If this sounds like you drop us an email at [hello@climatemind.org](mailto:hello@climatemind.org)

So I am currently developing an application and I am quite new to react. So please forgive me if this is somehow a silly question. I am using material ui with my application and am wondering how I might provide a light and a dark theme for example. So I am wrapping my App Component with a ThemeProvider Component which will get theme as a prop. My ultimate goal is to read out a folder structure in the folder "themes" and provide a entry to a select input for every folder found. When saving on a settings page the selected theme get's written to a sqlite database and the application will use the theme within the folder which was selected from the dropdown.

I hope you guys understand what I am trying to do. So here are the questions:

1. How can I read out a folderstructure and pipe that into props of a select component?
2. How can I read a string from a database and apply the theme.js within a subdirectory to the ThemeProvider theme prop?

Thanks for the help in advance,

Patrick

Hello,

Just wondering how I can add a cache header to axios get requests. Is this something I can command the browser to do frontend or do I have to configure something on my backend?

Thanks!

Over the course of the past few months, I‚Äôve been speaking to a few friends, students, and industry peers who have unfortunately lost their jobs. In one way or another, they have expressed anxiety or worry as they enter the current job market. This community has been nothing but amazing to me, so I  have been eagerly looking for ways to give back.

This past Saturday, May the 30th, 2020, along with \~30 engineers we held a workshop where we built a react app from scratch. We started with an empty terminal and added dependencies until we eventually worked our way to rendering content with React. As we added those dependencies we explored what each of them was doing and how they would play into the React ecosystem.

This is pretty much the first time I'm sharing something like this on the web so any feedback is greatly appreciated

I hope you can find some value from this tutorial! :D

Hey everyone,

I am a reactjs beginner. I want to learn how to react-router-v5. I know what `Route, exact, and switch` do. I am able to use redux-toolkit and know how states and hooks work. 

I have trouble getting Protected Routes + Redirect on login to work. I want to learn and understand it step by step. Because there's a lack of tutorials on this, I turn to you guys for this! :)

I'll implement it chunk by chunk. Each parent comment will have a chunk that I'll work on with your help!
