I wanna create a Gradle build for my Kotlin project. I saw there is a Kotlin jvm plugin and a multiplatform plugin.

What's the difference? Which one should I use if I intend to target the JVM?

If my kotlin project's target source is Java8 or above, need I use inline function in my project? Or does inline function improve the performance?
## [6][KVision v3.16.0 is released (with printing support)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/j6145b/kvision_v3160_is_released_with_printing_support/)

[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source web framework created for Kotlin/JS. It allows developers to build modern web applications with the Kotlin language.

I have released KVision 3.16.0, with the new module for printing. Based on an excellent [Print.js](https://printjs.crabbly.com/) library, it allows to easily print the content of any KVision component, directly from the browser window. It also supports printing PDF documents, images and any JSON-formatted tabular data.

Going further with the news, Kotlin sealed classes are now fully supported as parameters and return values in KVision fullstack interfaces. New multiplatform annotation based on Jackson `@JsonTypeInfo` has been introduced. See the [documentation](https://kvision.gitbook.io/kvision-guide/part-3-server-side-interface/common-code) for details.

Last but not least, we continue to enhance state management experience by introducing simple sub-store implementation for any instance of `ObservableState` interface. It's a way to partition your data and optimize rendering at the same time.

For more details about this release see the [changelog](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision/releases/tag/3.16.0).

As always, any feedback is appreciated.
## [7][Type mismatch, but I'm using toInt(), but it still says it is a String?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/j6b3ue/type_mismatch_but_im_using_toint_but_it_still/)

Edit: I should mention what db is and what result are, as well as the COL\_ID:

val db = this.*readableDatabase* val query = "Select \* from " + *TABLE\_NAME* 

val result = db.rawQuery(query, null)

And these vals

val *DATABASE\_NAME* = "MyDB" 

val *TABLE\_NAME* = "Users" 

val *COL\_NAME* = "name" 

val *COL\_AGE* = "age" 

val *COL\_ID* = "id" 

&amp;#x200B;

My error:[user.id](https://user.id) = result.getString(COL\_ID).toInt()

&amp;#x200B;

gives me the error:  "Type mismatch: inferred type is String but Int was expected"

&amp;#x200B;

I also tried  user.id = result.getInt(COL\_ID), but it still gives the same error.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently following this 2-video video series on SQLite in Android Studio in Kotlin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxHNcCXnxnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxHNcCXnxnE)

They do the above and get no error.

What am I doing wrong?

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to learn Android Studio, Kotlin, and SQL/SQLite all at the same time without anything but youtube tutorials (it's for a university project, but they're literally just teaching us HTML and then asking us to build an entire working app in Android Studio using Kotlin to have a SQLite interaction)
