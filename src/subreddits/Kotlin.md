I see a some protobuf files in kotlin repository, but I am curious to know what is it used for. It seems like its related to Intermediate Representation(IR). Does anyone knows? Why?

The latest Java version seems to be 14. Since I want to create a new project, I have no reason not to use the latest version. TornadoFX's Github main page says it does not support Java 9/10. But JDK 8 seems very old. According to Google search, the support seemed to end in 2020 (or unclear after 2020).

I downloaded and setup OpenJDK14 and JavaFX14. I could successfully run the [HelloFX sample](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx). Now, of course, I want to use an IDE.

 Q1: According to [this post](https://medium.com/@hinchman_amanda/tornadofx-migrating-jdk-8-to-open-jdk-11-a711290259ac), the author claims that TornadoFX  works with JDK11, even though the official GitHub says no. Does it mean that it can work with JDK14? I tried to follow it, but I got all sorts of compile errors for the default template TornadoFX project that I did not edit.

 Q2: If the answer to Q1 is no, since I could run HelloFX in the command line, and I could run a simple Kotlin project in IntelliJ with JDK14, doesn't it mean that at least "OpenJDK14 + JavaFX14 + Kotlin + IntelliJ" works? How more difficult is to use JavaFX in Kotlin without TornadoFX? Is the difference like using pure Win32 to create a GUI application vs using MFC?

So there's a good chance that this is just way outside of anything I could ever actually do, but I'm wondering how I'd go about modifying the grammar for the Kotlin language. Not for any particular purpose - just to learn.

Like, let's say I'd like to change the language such that instead of having a `data` keyword we instead have a `hippos` keyword that does the same thing (i.e. makes a class with equality/hashcode/toString/component etc etc overrides).

What would that process be like?

Edit: To be clear, I'm specifically talking about modifying the _compiler_, re-compiling and then compiling my hippos-tastic code. I'm not looking for a way to do it within the current confines of the language, I'm more wondering about it as an introduction to tinkering with the compiler. Like, in some source file somewhere there must be some logic that looks something like "If keyword == "data" emit this bytecode" or whatever.

[https://github.com/dickensas/kotlin-gradle-templates/tree/master/sboot-wasm-webgl](https://github.com/dickensas/kotlin-gradle-templates/tree/master/sboot-wasm-webgl)

This code has the capacity auto generate Kotlin WebAssembly runtime.js stub code for WebGL methods 

all methods and properties from OpenGL ES 2 like

GL\_DEPTH\_BITS  
GL\_STENCIL\_BITS  
.....  
.....  
glClear  
glClearColor  
glActiveTexture  
glBindTexture  
....  
....  
etc... all methods and properties

which means, we don't have to manually write canvas JavaScript code to access WebGLRenderingContext
