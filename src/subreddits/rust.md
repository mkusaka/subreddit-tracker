Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

Yesterday, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/eyj15s/highlightstderr_run_a_command_and_highlight_its/) highlight-stderr, to highlight the stderr of a process while preserving the order of stdout and stderr.

Among the wonderful feedback I received, /u/Freeky provided a PR to port the underlying [io-mux library](https://crates.io/crates/io-mux) to other UNIX platforms. I've released new versions of io-mux and highlight-stderr with those and other changes, and the new versions have now been confirmed to work on macOS and FreeBSD in addition to Linux!

I love the Rust community. Thanks to everyone who responded.

Hi, I'm new.

Can anyone share examples of how you might make a terminal app with it's own prompt?

Like while you are in the app it has it's own prompt and you type help or something and it displays a list of commands the app has that they can use.
## [12][rustfmt with single-line if else expression](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ezqeg3/rustfmt_with_singleline_if_else_expression/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ezqeg3/rustfmt_with_singleline_if_else_expression/

I am having difficulty getting formatting with rustfmt using a single-line if else expression within a match statement. This works fine with rustfmt (rustfmt doesn't change it):

    let y = if x &gt; 0 { x } else { 0 }; 

but if I put it in a match statement:

    let y = match list.iter().max() {
        Some(&amp;value) =&gt;  if value &gt; 0 { value } else { 0 },
        None =&gt; 0,
    }

then it gets formatted over like 5 lines (as rustfmt adds in an extra set of curly braces) and (in my opinion) makes it a bit more difficult to follow the logic of the match statement:

    let y = match list.iter().max() {
        Some(&amp;value) =&gt; {
            if value &gt; 0 {
                value
            } else {
                0
            }
        }
        None =&gt; 0,
    };

Is there a good way to turn this off or an option to do single-line if else expressions in a match statement?

Edit: or if there's a better way of matching / doing a match statement with this kind of conditional assignment then I'd be happy to learn!
