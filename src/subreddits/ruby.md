Hi Ruby community!

Virtually all of our company's products are built on rails. I understand that Ruby uses a cron scheduler called sidekiq that handles tries and retries. 

This is all unfamiliar territory for me because I'm not familiar with Ruby. I'm familiar however with other tools like Python. I'm curious as to what the best way of doing this would be. Is there an API I can query that would serve this exact info?

My company and I are working on Ruby on Rails projects and thinking about starting blog posts.The blog post of all natures. Short, long, technical, or something like a case study.My team on average has more than 10 years of experience in developing and managing an agency company.

What do you want to hear from us?

We are using Ruby on Rails and bunch of technology around that. At big projects, we are going without major frontend js frameworks like at basecamp and hey.

Hi! Beginner here.

So currently I'm trying to write a simple bubble sort code. In fact it works pretty well, but there's a problem with sorting at this point: gets.chomp.split(",") .

    def bubble_sort(array)
    n = array.length
    loop do 
    swapped = false
    (n-1).times do |i| 
    if array[i] &gt; array[i+1] 
    array[i], array[i+1] = array[i+1], array[i] 
    swapped = true end
    end
     break if not swapped
    end 
    array 
    end
    puts "Type your array:" array = gets.chomp.split(",")
    p bubble_sort(array)

When I type for example: 100,1,10 the output is correct. But then if I type: 10,1,4,66,0 the output is \["0", "1", "10", "4", "66"\].

New rails tech is coming around and new big projects are launched on rails (like basecamp has released the new awesome [hey.com](https://hey.com) email platform running on rails without any major JS frameworks).

Chris Oliver from gorails discussed it in the [freshest remote ruby podcast](https://remoteruby.transistor.fm/83) and said...

&gt;"It feels good to be in Rails right now"

Do you share this feeling?

Hi all,

Newbie at Ruby here, created a small script to do some media conversion to allow my TV to play the media files. Most of it I'm ok with apart from the new\_filename creation, is there a cleaner way to split the pathname down multiple times?

Also any general feedback on construction would be appreciated as well.

&amp;#x200B;

    # frozen_string_literal: true
    
    require 'pathname'
    require 'streamio-ffmpeg'
    require 'slop'
    
    # Set path to recursively search directories
    opts = Slop.parse do |o|
      o.string '-d', '--directory', 'a directory to search'
      o.on '-h', '--help' do
        puts "Usage: ruby Check-MediaFiles.rb '/enter/path/to/search/'"
        exit
      end
    end
    
    path = opts[:directory]
    
    # Search all subdirectories for mp4 and mkv files to process and begin loop
    Pathname.glob(path + '/*/*.{mp4,mkv,avi}').each do |file|
      # Change to each directory
      Dir.chdir(file.dirname)
    
      # Instantiate movie object for processing
      media = FFMPEG::Movie.new(file.to_s)
    
      # Create new filename from metadata
      temp1_filename = file.basename.to_s
      temp2_filename = temp1_filename.split('/')[-1]
      temp3_filename = temp2_filename.split('.')[0]
      new_filename = temp3_filename + '.mp4'
    
      # Check got ac3 audio in media file and convert if not found.
      if file.extname == '.avi'
        puts 'AVI detected. Re-encoding to mp4 for compatibility with Samsung TV.'
        media.transcode(new_filename.to_s, %W[-c:v copy -c:a ac3])
        File.delete(file)
        next
      elsif media.audio_codec != 'ac3'
        puts "AC3 audio codec not detected on #{file.basename} converting audio to AC3."
        media.transcode(new_filename.to_s, %w[-c:v copy -c:a ac3])
        puts "Completed conversion to ac3 audio for #{new_filename}"
        File.delete(file)
      else
        puts "No conversion required for #{file.basename}"
      end
    end

I'm just getting started with programming, my current job is willing to pay for me to get a course or attend a conference. All though I'll probably would go for an interactive course so I can ask questions. Can I get some recommendations from the community? 

I like to learn the following:
Ruby 
Ruby on rails
SQL advance queries
ActiveRecord advance queries

I work with a lot of data so having a depth knowledge of the last two would be awesome. Thank you in advance!
