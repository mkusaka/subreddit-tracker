Hello,  I have been learning React through a Udemy course.  Before beginning a project, I have to run npm run eject and modify the css-loader property (localIdentName) from webpack.config.dev.js, webpack.config.prodigy.js files. But, even after running the eject command, I don't see these files. Please help.

Hello all,

I have created a large react application. After building it for the production, it is taking a lot of time to lot and the \[number\].\[hash\].chunk.js file is more than 30MB. Due to which, it is taking more time. During code splitting by lazy loading is not helpful.

Can you please suggest a way to optimize the performance?

I made a searchbar for my navbar, but when ever I do searches it also expands the navbar because of the search options. How do I set it up so the options expand past the navbar without resizing navbar.

I am searching for youtube channels that provide code with good quality, people keep saying that learning from youtube is not good as most channel creators are people with no experience in programming and provide code that is not adopted in production environment, so i would be thankful if some good reddit folks guided me on that, I really search for channels that provide real world projects with good code. Thanks in advance!
