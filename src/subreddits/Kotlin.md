The title.
The information I found is at least one yeard old.
I have 0 knowledge in programming but usually, I am a fast learner. I can learn foreign languages (not programming) very fast. So I want to try and see how it will go.

It may sound weird but I want to build a couple of apps that are not too complicated like a Tv Guide for my country because there is no good one right now.

Any recommendations are welcome - books, online courses. I can search for myself but there are so many out there and would like to pick something that someone else on my level (0) learned something and was good enough to make them start programming.

Thanks.

Hey, I need to know on which coroutine dispatcher should I use for querying the data or insert data from the database if my service and MySQL database are on the same machine.

    withContext(whatDispatcher) {   
        database.getData()
    }

Thanks for your time.

Do you want to develop mutual TLS Web services in Kotlin? Hexagon 1.2 got released today with that feature, check the following section to learn how: https://hexagonkt.com/port_http_server/#https 

You can check all project's examples and source code at GitHub : https://github.com/hexagonkt

If you give it a go, please share your feedback!

## [7][kapt3 stub does not include package name of a generated class annotation parameter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/epxmc7/kapt3_stub_does_not_include_package_name_of_a/)

This works:

    @Subcomponent(modules = [shiv.SharedViewModelProviders::class])
    interface ViewModels {
        val fragmentsComponentFactory: Fragments.Factory
    
        @Subcomponent.Factory
        interface Factory {
            fun create(@BindsInstance owner: ViewModelStoreOwner): ViewModels
        }
    }

but when I import the `shiv.SharedViewModelProviders` class and change the first line to

    @Subcomponent(modules = [SharedViewModelProviders::class])

I suddenly get this compile error

    /home/mz/projects/android/FavoritePrimes/app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/ph/codeia/favoriteprimes/ViewModels.java:6: error: cannot find symbol
    @dagger.Subcomponent(modules = {SharedViewModelProviders.class})
                                    ^
      symbol: class SharedViewModelProviders

and the stub file looks like

    package ph.codeia.favoriteprimes;
    
    import java.lang.System;
    
    @kotlin.Metadata(/* snip */)
    @dagger.Subcomponent(modules = {SharedViewModelProviders.class})
    public abstract interface ViewModels {
        // [snip]

There's no import for `shiv.SharedViewModelProviders` and the parameter is not fully qualified. This class is generated by an annotation processor I made. What's going on? The import is clearly in the source file. Is there some flag I should enable in my annotation processor to fix this?


**[UPDATE]**

`kapt { correctErrorTypes = true }` in the build script fixes this. Unfortunately, it has to be done on the client side and not in my library. I can only add a note in the docs.

BTW, [this is the library in question](https://github.com/monzee/shiv). It allows you to use constructor injection in fragments and view models using dagger with very little boiler plate (constant wrt the number of fragment and view model classes). Somebody might find it handy.

My  company is planning on porting a semi-large C# application to either java  or kotlin.  It will not run on android or anything like that.  It will  be micro-service based and have a pretty complicated GUI on top.  I keep  reading that Kotlin is more productive than java, but I'm wondering if  that is just hype. What feature specifically increase productivity.

Any opinions?

(full disclosure.. I asked a similar question on java, to get the negative point of view)
## [9][What do you use for Dependency Injection?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/epj2p4/what_do_you_use_for_dependency_injection/)

I'm working on a project creating AWS Lambdas using Kotlin, and there's currently no dependency injection being used. I've only previously used Spring, which we are not using on this project. So rather than use Spring just to get its DI abilities (which aren't really suited to cloud functions anyway due to being runtime), I am looking at an alternative.

Dagger seems to be widely used, but looks complicated with a lot of boiler plate. Does anyone have any preference for Koin or Kodein?
