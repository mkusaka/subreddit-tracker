This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I'm curious what are some successful Android apps that have been built and still being maintained by a single developer instead of a small/medium/large team. 
Could you share any? üòÅ

This really inconvenient: I need to download an emulator image for a certain API level. The download is quite big; and **blocks** the whole IDE! Now I am forced to wait.

Is there a workaround, by the way?

Hi there,

I submitted an issue on the Android Jetpack - Room IssueTracker almost a week ago and I haven't had any activity on it. Roughly how long is one expected to wait? What are your experiences with submitting an issue there? Should I be expecting a reply at all?  Also, what should one do when there isn't a reply? Apart from StackOverflow, is there a place where I can get some guidance about my specific issue since I am developing my app alone?

For those who are interested, here is the link to my issue: [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/157261134](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/157261134) I don't know, maybe some of you could provide some insight :)

When implementing a new endpoint using Retrofit, do you guys make a request and check the response by using some http client, like Postman, or do you just somehow use Retrofit for it?

With Retrofit it's possible to declare a response type as a String so that to just log it out and examine it, but then you need to hook another interactor, which is an additional library, which is actually fine, yet every time you need to do this repetitive setup.

Or is it just silly to use Retrofit for checking what is the structure of the response?

My workflow is like the first one, i.e. Postman goes first, yet I'm thinking there might be nicer ways doing it. Thank you!

Update: This question goes under an assumption there's no example of the response you need to describe for parsing with the library.

Here is what I have tried so far:

``` 
adb devices
```
and it didn't detect de device. 

After 20-30 minutes of furious googling, I found this repo: https://github.com/ribomation/DroidAtScreen1

Set the variable and compiled the program. It executed a blank screen.

Do you guys have any other ideas for this? 

Thank you so much in advance
