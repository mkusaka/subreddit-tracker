Sorry, this is a complete ramble.

I have recently given golang an actually chance. I had an opportunity to write golang at work over a year ago when we decided to use it in one of our services. I immediately brushed away the chance because of how golang didn't look so familiar (like C syntax languages). It breaks a few conventions that I'm familiar with.

Fast forward to literally yesterday around lunchtime and something in my head entices me to learn go. I immediately find "gobyexample" and I'm hooked. Spent the entire lunch learning about go.

Once I got home, all I can think about is learning go. I immediately join this subreddit. I don't know a lot of go, I've only written sub basic things in go (client/server ping pong deal), but I just love it.

I haven't felt this way about a language since I learned Lua all those years ago. And when I learned Java at first... I hated it (I've been doing it for 5 years now though,  so its like a spoken language to me at this point).

Do you guys still feel this way about go?

Hello, I just started writing blog posts and would really appreciate feedback on my first blog post in Go, titled [Handling Signals in Go](https://arberiii.github.io/go/2020/06/02/signals-go.html).

Hello,  I am trying to reduce a sliceâ€™s length using a maximum count parameter. Here is the code. It is quite ok. But I am open for advices.

&amp;#x200B;

    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	records := selectRecords(1000)
    	fmt.Println(len(records))
    }
    
    func selectRecords(maximumRecordCount float64) []string {
    	records := make([]string, 5987)
    	recordCount := float64(len(records))
    	if recordCount &lt;= maximumRecordCount {
    		return records
    	}
    	step := recordCount / maximumRecordCount
    	var filteredRecords []string
    	for i := 0.0; i &lt; recordCount; i += step {
    		filteredRecords = append(filteredRecords, records[int(i)])
    	}
    	return filteredRecords
    }

Hi gophers,

for an University project me and another classmate created a spreading disease simulation tool in golang, I decided to post here because I thought it could be a useful starting point for someone. At this stage it is a bit tricky to edit parameters, by the way if someone is interested can contribute in order to improve it. Star it if you like it!

**TL;DR**: there are a lot of customizable parameters, Montecarlo Simulation with Confidence Intervals calculation, Containment Measures and many more features...

The software is able to create and allocate a big graph using a relative low amount of RAM; by default the graph consist of around 4mln nodes and 150 edges per node, note that 32gb RAM is needed. Generally you can use a 400k nodes 150 edges with around 4 gb ram usage; if you suggest some feedback to reduce the amount of usage is appreciated.

We build a 4mln nodes graph because is the population in Veneto Region in Italy, and 150 edges per node is the Dunbar number, We know it's a rough rappresentation, but for our purpose was good enough; you can still load your graph in json format.

We provide a simple Montecarlo Simulation that consists on running multiple time the spreading simulation, collect data and save them on csv.

After that we run a python script to calculate confidence intervals with Asymptotic Formulas and Bootstrap algorithm. As final step the script plot some matplotlib graphs of the measured metrics.

Where can I find the code smells related to Golang?
