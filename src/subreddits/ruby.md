The following lines of code come from the httparty gem. I do not understand the first line. What does it do and what does it resolve to ?


    dir = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'lib')) # The problem is here

    require File.join(dir, 'httparty')
    require 'pp'
    config = YAML.load(File.read(File.join(ENV['HOME'], '.twitter')))

 It tried to run it on irb but got the message:   

**NameError (undefined local variable or method `File' for main:Object)**
