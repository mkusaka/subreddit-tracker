I find mocking typescript classes with Jest, so painful, does anyone else find this?

I'm trying to mock a single class, and it just turns into so much code.

Are there are good resources / libraries for mocking classes with typescript?

## [6][Deriving sub interface using utility type Omit and Pick . Some issues with refactoring and linting .](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/idu0k5/deriving_sub_interface_using_utility_type_omit/)

Here is one example :

    interface mega {
    	a : string,
    	bb : number,
    	c : boolean
    }
    
    type mini1 = Pick&lt;mega,"a"|"bb"/*does give intellisense*/&gt;;
    type mini2 = Omit&lt;mega,"a"/*does not give intellisense*/,"d"/*does not even exist and does not lint error*/&gt;;

1)You get intellisense for the properties for Pick but not for Omit . Why ? 

2)You refactor a to aa and it does not work in both Pick and Omit . Why ?

3)Omit does not lint error if you omit properties that do not exist . Why ?

Hi,

I want to learn typescript, not for a server-side or a client-side application but for writing standalone applications. I am not very familiar with javascript, I mainly write in Python. What topics should I learn before typescript? From my understanding, I need at least to learn the basics of node.js and javascript. Is there a good tutorial or course that covers all these topics? 

Thanks!

For example :

    function foo({a = 1 , b} = {}) {
        console.log(a,b);
    }
    foo({});//1 undefined
    foo();//1 undefined
    foo({a : 2});//2 undefined
    foo({b : 2});//1 2
    foo({a : 3 ,b : 2});//3 2

How do I type the argument of that function in typescript ?

The question in the title .

Sometimes I find my self having to create bigger interfaces by composing the smaller ones . The issue here is that the smaller ones get edited once in a while and nothing guarantees that they do not collide when they are merged .

As far as I understand ISP has nothing to do with preventing collisions .

Then how does someone prevents the collisions ? Unit testing ? 

I did [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hjif2w/checking_for_interface_collisions/) some time ago , similar to this one and got no real help .

Hey there TypeScript  wizards of the internet! :3

I'm trying to do the following and I'm not sure if it's somehow possible to archive with TypeScript. I'd like to write a database repository like class that takes a generic and then uses it in its constructor to create the database connection to the table provided as the generic.

I'm using TypeOrm which has a getRepository function that takes an Entity class which represents a table. My problem is that this function takes a class as a parameter and I'm not able to use the type provided as a generic.

I'll try to illustrate what the end result in my head would look like: 

    declare class BaseEntity {};
    // Dummy class that represents a table
    declare class User extends BaseEntity {};
    
    // Imitates the functionality of the getRepository function
    type DBConnection&lt;T&gt; = { getOne: () =&gt; Promise&lt;T&gt; }
    type getRepository &lt;T extends BaseEntity&gt; = (entity: T) =&gt; DBConnection&lt;T&gt;;
    
    // Imitates the getRepository function provided by TypeOrm
    declare const getRepository: getRepository&lt;any&gt;;
    
    class DatabaseConnector&lt;T&gt; {
        connection: DBConnection&lt;T&gt; 
        
        constructor() {
            // Establish database connection for class provided as the generic
            // Here I get the error that 'T' only refers to a type but is being used as
            // value which is obvious bcs. it is just a type.
            this.connection = getRepository(T);
        }
    
        // Some dummy function to use the connection
        findOne(): Promise&lt;T&gt; {
            return this.connection.getOne();
        }
    }
    
    // Bootstrapping function for an async context
    const bootstrap = async () =&gt; {
        const db = new DatabaseConnector&lt;User&gt;();
        // This should now hold a user from the db;
        const user = await db.findOne();
    }

My question now refers to the problem lying in the constructor. How can I reflect from the generic type to the actual class it represents? Is this even possible using TypeScript? Can I use reflect-metadata to accomplish what I'm trying to do? 

I know that some other languages like C# or Java have offer similar features but I haven't had any experience with that either. 

Thank you so much for your help!

So let's say we have ts and css file in the "src" directory. In ts file we have import './style.css'. After compiling TS to "lib" directory, that path is no longer valid for compiled file, because css file is not compiled. How would you make it change to '../src/style.css'?
