I'm making a builder for any class. It's based on KProperty reflections and it works well for now, but I want to improve an interface of it. Here is an example of current usage:  


    data class Data(
        val nonDef: String,
        val defValue: String = "DEF_VALUE",
        val copyValue: String = nonDef,
        val nonDef2: String,
        val aMap: Map&lt;String, String&gt; = emptyMap(),
)
    val builtData = Builder&lt;Data&gt;()
        .assign(Data::aMap, mapOf("key" to "value"))
        .assign(Data::nonDef2, "10")
        .assign(Data::nonDef, "10")
        .build()

I don't like, that I have to specify Data:: receiver for every property reference in assign method. Data class is already given as generic for Builder, so I can pass only reference with receiving Data class.

So, I want to make new function prettyAssign() with callable argument, where class reference receiver  is passed as function receiver for callable, so I could address ::aMap, ::nonDef and ::nonDef2 to implicit 'this'. Here how it would look like:

    class Builder&lt;T : Any&gt;(val kClass: KClass&lt;T&gt;) {
        fun &lt;K&gt; assign(prop: KProperty1&lt;T, K&gt;, value: K)
            : Builder&lt;T&gt; = TODO("doing all reflection magic here")
            
        fun &lt;K&gt; prettyAssign(call: KClass&lt;T&gt;.() -&gt; Pair&lt;KProperty1&lt;T, K&gt;, K&gt;) {
            val (prop, value) = call(kClass)
            return assign(prop, value)
        }
    }
    
    val builtData = DataBuilder&lt;Data&gt;()
        .prettyAssign { ::aMap to mapOf("key" to "value") }
        .prettyAssign { ::nonDef2 to "10" }
        .prettyAssign { ::nonDef to "10" }
        .build()

In that approach it doesn't work, because KClass&lt;T&gt; doesn't have references to T properties.

So, I don't understand, is there a way to make prettyAssign() working

 Hello! 

I'm trying to create fat jar for my kotlin multiplatform project which will then be used as a dependency on another project. When I'm trying to use the class defined in the multiplatform project on the other project, it's not able to find/import it. However, when I opened the created jar, I can see it's there (along with all the dependencies).

There is a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62770101) that I found on how to build a fat jar for multiplatform project and I pretty much just followed that. Correct me if I'm wrong, since my multiplatform project doesn't have a main class, I do not need to include the part where it adds the main class to the attributes.

I have been having hard time to get this to work. Most of the examples online are for multiplatform projects with main class. Is there any tutorial on how to build a fat jar for a multiplatform project that doesn't have main class? Any help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!Â

Suppose I wanted to know what properties are available on the Kotlin object introduced by the Kotlin JVM Gradle plugin. From the [Using Gradle reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) I can see that kotlin.incremental is a valid property, but is there a real reference of all properties and methods of the kotlin JVM plugin (preferably w/o having to use reflection to find them)?
