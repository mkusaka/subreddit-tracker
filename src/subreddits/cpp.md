**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

Just wondering if I am going down the right path. I want to do it in C++ but sometimes installing these dependencies (Mongo driver/RabbitMQ driver) take a long time and lots of research.

Hey guys, beginner here. I started making a text adventure game and I'm really into it now would like to complete it but it's difficult as I don't know exactly what kind of code I need to implement for this to work as I'd like it to. I thought it would be a good idea to look at some source code for a text adventure that's already been made but they're usually too different from the kind of text adventure I want to make.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the code I have now. (I know it's messy) Hopefully this gives an idea of what I'm after: [https://pastebin.com/8x1yz5GV](https://pastebin.com/8x1yz5GV)
## [12][Is any optimizer able to cache same calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/horbq2/is_any_optimizer_able_to_cache_same_calls/)

Hello everybody!

I have a function which does the same call twice.

    double compute(const char *) __attribute__ ((pure));
    
    double f(const char* const data, const bool flag)
    {
        if (!flag &amp;&amp; compute(data) == 0.0)
            return 4.2;
        return compute(data) &lt; 100.0 ? -0.1 : 100.0;
    }

Is it possible to hint somehow the compiler to optimize such calls? I tried using `__attribute__((pure))`, but that didn't help.

Maybe some other compliers can do this?
