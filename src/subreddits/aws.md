Just got an email about this. One of the most often cited advantages of GKE over EKS was that, unlike EKS, in GKE you only pay for resources that run your containers, and the management layer was free.

Now, starting in June, GKE is going to cost $100 a month. Still slightly cheaper than EKS, though.

hi,

I have uploaded couple of few-GB files into S3, and then transformed them to glacier deep archive, in some cases I had issues and I had to again uploaded some files, so some files were uploaded only partially, and it seems they were not overwritten or deleted automatically by AWS..

Right now it seems that AWS charges me for those partially uploaded files on S3 which were not transformed into glacier, and the issue is that i'm not even able to see those files in those buckets..

in lifecycle properties there's an option "Clean up incomplete multipart uploads" but i guess it concerns only newly uploaded files, 

how can I now delete those invalid partially uploaded files to S3 in order not be charged for them ? apparently cost is higher for those comparing to glacier deep archive.

thanks

You can pick one new managed service and one acquisition/clone for reinvent 2020.

I want managed Airflow and acquired DBT.

What about you all?

Does anyone know if a schedule expression generator exists for AWS?  I use cloudwatch event rules extensively, and one of the challenges is the cron format does not follow traditional linux/unix so most publicly available cron generators wont work.

As stated above really. What does everyone recommend for a 15 connection windows 2019 Server?   
The server will be in Sydney with people connecting from Perth, Singapore, China and Sydney.   


I work with Linux firebird databases and I am looking at windows for my Dad's business.  
he only needs office, MYOB, Nitro Pro 9, CAD and about 500gbs space.

Thanks to anyone in advanced if I cannot comment back. I should be able to respond for the next hour or so.   


Cheers.

Well, just got the email. Figured it was likely to happen, but goddamn it. We only get one AWS event a year, and now it's gone. No word of rescheduling, but i can't see it happening. Colour me disappointed I guess.
