Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

We’re on the engineering team for Android Studio, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, July 30**!

I've been maintaining a moderately successful app over the past few years that most users love. 99% of my English users rate it at 5 stars and say they love it.

But then I have a lot of non-English (mostly Brazilian) users that download the app not fully understanding what it is. So they end up leaving a 1 star review with comments like "worthless" or "garbage." Over time this has gradually lowered my overall rating.

I don't want to limit what countries I make the app available to as I have a lot of non-English users that do understand the app and love it. Plus non-America sales are about 33% of my income.

I'm also hesitant to add a disclaimer in Spanish to my store page because of the impact it may on on SEO.

Can anybody suggest how I might avoid this problem? Thanks for any ideas!

[Neumorphism Android](https://github.com/thelumiereguy/NeumorphismView-Android)

[A clone of the CRED app as a demo](https://preview.redd.it/p7uglzzmy4e51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a95839783875f29ecfb1221ee14f16f28363b9e)

There are already a few libraries to achieve Neumorphism on Android. But I've added a **Custom ConstraintLayout.** So you can directly use this ViewGroup or as a normal CardView. The ConstraintLayout can give you the effect on each of its children, so you don't have to manually wrap each child with the card view. 

This is my first ever library. So, please try it out and am open to suggestions.

Google has released a new way of passing data between Activities/Fragments which replaces the widely used `onActivityResult`.  It's called [ActivityResult](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/jetpack-activityresult.html).

## [10][Failed an android exam for a job. Would like to ask what I could've done better.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i1193q/failed_an_android_exam_for_a_job_would_like_to/)

 Here is the github link for the project:  
[https://github.com/gmatcat/EnglishCentralExam](https://github.com/gmatcat/EnglishCentralExam)

This was the positions' responsibilities for Android Developer

* Design and develop Android mobile applications using an agile and test-driven development process
* Unit test code and build instrumented tests
* Implement custom native user interfaces using latest Android programming techniques
* Document and maintain design specifications, source code, and archives for new applications and ideas
* Perform individual project components within the entire development lifecycle including implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance
* Work from UI/UX requirements, APIs, mockups to build functional, high-performance Android phone and tablet apps

The exam details:

(CRUD person) Given a pre-defined fictional product, account schema, develop a shopping cart

proof of concept application that should show the following key elements:

● Show product listing

● User can select a product

● User can add product to shopping cart

● Shopping cart shows the currently added products

● User can check out, simulates fake payment and a success page.

and use these libraries ( I used all of them )  
Butterknife, RXJava, Dagger, Retrofit, GreenDAO

The notes I sent them:  
Inserted mock product/user data on LoginActivity onCreate and on main thread since pre-defined data is required.  
Created mock retrofit implementation on Presenters and commented it since data source is from GreenDao.   
GreenDao DB architecture may not be the best since it's my first time using it.  
Tested with real device Vivo1811.  
No handling of DB upgrade, shopping cart delete, choose payment method, create account, edit account details.  
No unit/instrumented tests   
15 products in total, separated in three categories.

No language was specified so I used native Java. They told me "The final rating of your exam is on the average, not bad but also not that impressive. The open position that we have will undergo a few days of training since we currently have a big project that has to be done as early as possible. We also made some changes with the requirements for this position like senior level with more than 5 years of work experience in android development." I have only 2+.

I'm not able to put on the most effort since I was also working. I also did not put much into design as I would assume they have a UI/UX designer.

They gave me 7 days to work on it but I sent it only after 5 days because I think it was already "good enough" and wouldn't like someone getting ahead of me for the position. In hindsight that was probably a mistake as I would have more time making unit tests. They also did not pull my project which means they just checked the code and the screenshots I sent them.

I felt as though I have become too comfortable since I already have a job at a small company and have plateaued in the last year or so. How would someone with 5 years of experience in Android development do this project with 7 days? I will truly appreciate any feedback that can be done to improve my code. Thank you very much.

Since 27 July, my AdMob reporting shows that in some countries (mostly Japan, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand) there are placements (Banner and Interstitials) with Zero Impressions but with a positive number of Clicks (and they generates a revenue too).

Anyone else facing this?
