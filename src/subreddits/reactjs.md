We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey guys, Iâ€™m a student in Web Dev and enjoy creating designs as well. This is the first portfolio page Iâ€™ve made that Iâ€™ve really been proud of. 

[juliacodes.com](http://juliacodes.com)

Iâ€™m looking for some reviews as well as helpful comments regarding the style and application. I wanted the focus of the site to be on the projects, so I chose to remove any linking to internal pages (about, contact, etc) and just included individual project pages that describe the process of each one.

Iâ€™d love to hear any comments on the usability of the site and whether this is a good layout for job seeking and showing off my skills!

So I'm just trying to link these two scripts into my React app (Gatsby), but I can't figure out where/ or how to do this. It keeps throwing syntax errors. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

`&lt;script src="`[`https://js.adsrvr.org/up_loader.1.1.0.js`](https://js.adsrvr.org/up_loader.1.1.0.js)`" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`  
`&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;`  
  `ttd_dom_ready( function() {`  
`if (typeof TTDUniversalPixelApi === 'function') {`  
`var universalPixelApi = new TTDUniversalPixelApi();`  
`universalPixelApi.init("w2aii4f", ["pla67r3"], "`[`https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up"`](https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up%22)`);`  
`}`  
  `});`

Hi, I recently just finished building my portfolio and would love some feedback! 

[https://alexteshome.com](https://alexteshome.com)

I drew inspiration from various few other portfolios linked here before. 

I built it with Next.js, with API to deal with the contact form. Also some libraries for some of the scrolling functionality (did not know of an easier way to deal with that, if anyone knows a simpler way?). There might be a few bugs on mobile as well.

Thanks in advance!

So I am working on a simple demo app which pulls some data from a public API and shows profile cards with some info. I put some buttons to navigate through profiles, and I did so by simply using a counter state hook and accessing profiles with 
```object[count]``` notation. 

Well it does work, but problems arise when I exceed the array size when navigating through profiles. I tried fixing it by making it loop back to the first profile if it hits the last profile and tries to navigate forward again, and vice versa like so:

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
            if (count &gt;= userCount){
                setCount(0);
            } else if (count &lt; 0) {
                setCount(userCount);
            }
        }, [count]);

I thought this would do the trick but effect hook triggers AFTER incrementing the counter, thus navigating forward to a null profile, resulting in errors. 

Is my approach wrong? What would be the best solution?

I did quite a bit of research before posting this question. First my question, then what I already learned, and what I am still confused about:

&amp;#x200B;

I am building a landing page with an email list sign up form and a referral program. For ex: someone lands on the page, they enter their email and they're put in a queue. They're then given a unique URL: [https://landing.com/?ref=xxxxx](https://landing.com/xxxxx).

&amp;#x200B;

They can then share this URL and if other people sign up for the list, the referrers spot in the queue goes up. Pretty simple logic here too. Just look at query parameter when submitting email into list.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is though, out of create-react-app, next.js, and Gatsby, what is the best option to use? The site is completely static, except for sending a POST request for the email sign up. If email already on list, show them their spot in line, otherwise, add email to list and show them ways to move up in line. Mostly trying to figure out between Next.js and Gatsby. I was leaning towards Gatsby since site is so static but I'm wondering if the email referral will make it hard, so kind of confused now. I'd also like a good CI/CD workflow through Github if possible. (doesn't have to be static / hosted on Github. I don't mind hosting on GCP or something).

&amp;#x200B;

The site will also have a couple other pages like "About," "Contact," etc.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you recommend?

Hey guys,  I have been googling for a couple days now but havenâ€™t gotten much help so time to come to the place of all places Reddit

Iâ€™m working on a ReatJs project where it is mobile friendly and there are videos Id like the user to click the video when they are on their phone

I installed react-touch-events 
created it as a function and wrapped ReactTouchEvents in my video section 

The only issue iâ€™m having is the functionality on the handle 

I know that it is not supposed to be like handlePause or Play event so I was wondering How I could make it work? 

I can send my code over or just copy the piece of what I have 

const HandleTap = e =&gt; {
console.log() â€”- (I need help with functionality in this space)
}

Thank you guys so much
