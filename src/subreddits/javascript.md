Hi everyone, I take APCSP and am currently remote learning, so accessing my teacher for help is a lot more difficult. I am currently coding for a tic-tac-toe game but am having trouble. Whenever the user clicks on the screen, only X’s appear, regardless of the function I have which should make O’s appear when it is player 2’s turn. Any help would be appreciated!!
