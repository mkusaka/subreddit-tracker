The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring companyâ€”no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job.

## [2][Make tsconfig reference all exported variables (for testing mock/spy/stub)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ja4zqn/make_tsconfig_reference_all_exported_variables/)

I have a file like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Foo.tsx:

`export default function Foo() {`

`return 'hi';`

`}`

GroupItem.tsx:

`import Foo from 'Foo.tsx';`

`export const useGroupIds = () =&gt; [];`

`export default function GroupItem() {`

`const groupIds = useGroupIds();`

`return &lt;Foo /&gt;`

`}`

We see in \`GroupItem\` I reference \`useGroupIds\`. This is captured by reference. Is it possible to make TypeScript refer to it as \`module.useGroupIds\`?

I ask this because I am trying to write a test and put a spy on \`useGroupIds\` but when I do that \`spy(module, 'useGroupIds')\` the \`GroupItem\` is not using this spied one as it caught it by reference.

My hope is to get ts to compile the above like this:

`import Foo from 'Foo.tsx';`

`export const useGroupIds = () =&gt; [];`

`export default function GroupItem() {`

`const groupIds = GroupItemModule.useGroupIds();`

`return &lt;`[`FooModule.Foo`](https://FooModule.Foo) `/&gt;`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

So now when I mock like this:

`import * as FooModule from './Foo';`

`import * as GroupItemModule from './GroupItem';`

`jest.spyOn(FooModule, 'default')`

`jest.spyOn(GroupItemModule, 'useGroupIds')`

Then the spied functions will be properly called.

I have a type prop:

`type prop = { width?: number; height?: number; id?: number /* etc... */ [key: string]: any }`

I use `prop` (as shown above) for several components. However, I want to require `id: number` for other components. So these components will have the `prop` from above looking more like this: `type prop = { width?: number; height?: number; id: number; /* etc... */ [key: string]: any }`

Is it possible to require an `id` for certain components, but not others, using the same `type prop = {}`?

I'm sorry to cross post but having working at this for several days and cannot find an answer.

## [7][The performance of index.ts files](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j9si8i/the_performance_of_indexts_files/)

I'm working on a CLI that uses index.ts files to slice the code base into unidirectional layers:

    - core   
      /index.ts 
    - util   
      /index.ts 
    - etc 

I'm really happy with the architecture, but recently I noticed a huge performance boost when not using barrel imports from index.ts files. When instead importing from individual files, the CLI ran multitudes faster.

It seems that when a CLI-feature imports from the core-barrel, the import would include all internal and external modules in that barrel, even though it only uses a fraction of them. Take this as an example:

    - core   
      /expensive.ts   
      /quick.ts   
      /index.ts 

If the said CLI-feature uses only quick.ts, it would still import everything associated to expensive.ts through the barrel-import.

Is there any way to get around this? I'd guess that 99.9% of developers using index.ts files do so to improve readability and architecture. The almost accidental import of everything inside a barrel just seems like an unwanted side-effect.

Right now I'm thinking of rewiring all barrel-imports in a prebuild step, but that feels so ugly!
## [8][TS can't infer the returns from a callback function](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j9zknb/ts_cant_infer_the_returns_from_a_callback_function/)

I'm not clear on how to handle async callbacks with TS. In the following method TS can't infer the return paths from the async callback:

        async send(): Promise&lt;object&gt; {
          &lt;config removed&gt;
    
          mailgun.messages().send(messageDetails, (error, message) =&gt; {
            if (error) return { error };
            return { message };
          });
        }
    
    // A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' 
    // must return a value.ts(2355)

What is the proper way to assert that the callback will handle the returns here?

I've developed this open source library which allows safely exposing PostgreSQL APIs with minimal amount of code. Features:

\- CRUD operations

\- Subscriptions

\- Optimistic Client-Server data replication

\- Security Rules

\- Generated TS Types for database schema

WIP: Auth + Android library

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently rewritten it in TypeScript and I am now open to any feedback or comments you might have.

Thanks for reading!

So I have a ts file from which I export a class and an object . The class has JSDoc comments on its methods. There are no JSDoc comments somewhere else in the file . Is there any way to convert the JSDoc comments for the exported class to single markdown file?
## [11][Asserting type of value of keyof some object](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j9sl7u/asserting_type_of_value_of_keyof_some_object/)

Time and time again I encounter this problem:
Say I have a generic object T.
In typescript I can easily describe a string key of T:
key: keyof T &amp; string.

What I dont understand how to do is type the value of that lookup using key. For example, how do I express that a key leads to a Date value? As far as I can understand, indexers dont solve this problem as they index the whole object, not a specific key.

I keep trying to create functions that recieve an object and a key of said object, and return the value from that lookup - again while asserting a specific return type, without a general indexer.
