This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Going through the android course on Udacity, currently on the Android architecture Components  and they're doing things I just really dont understand. As a complete noob between that course and looking at everyone posts here about new tech stacks that seem so complex I feel lost. Is this normal as a beginner? Does it get easier?


Edit: for reference I'm a HS Senior, with a background in Python, Front end web dev, and learning Java (almost finished the course at school)

Edit2: Thanks for the clarity fellas (and ladies), I'll take your reccomendations and just start making simple apps to get started. You're right it's just inherently hard to learn

Hey guys,

I made an app for my library to test out all functionality and also generate the XML layout! I could possibly also turn this into a library :)!

hello there!

i trying to make an app that can stream videos from phone to samsung smart tv,

i tried using [Cling library](https://github.com/4thline/cling) and was successful only to start the stream but cant control the tv, no pause,seek, volume..

i reserched everything there is on google about libraries and portocols (without going to deep with dlna signed integers..)

from what i understand samsung use some internal custom version of dlna,

so i found "[Smartview SDK](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/extension-libraries/smart-view-sdk/android-sender-app.html)" on samsung developers website,

guess what last update was in 2017/8, the documentaion is \~ok

but i cant make it work (got some 300 error from tv).

i did succeed to make "[hello world](https://smartviewsdk.github.io/API-GUIDE/android-api/docs/)" app that worked

so i checked other apps on the palystore XCast and BubbleUpnp

and they work flawlessly, stream,pause,seek everything...

my next step is try reverse engineer with fiddler.

can someone point to somethig useful in this topic? i really hate reverse engineering

thank you!

I updated two apps on Wednesday. They're still pending review on Google Play. In that same time, I've updated iOS versions of those same apps on the AppStore, and each has been ready in less than 24hrs.

Last night at 1am, I updated the third iOS app. That took less than 8 hours to get to the AppStore.

These are unprecedented times.

I have a chat app designed, all the UI and the front-end is developed.
But how do I connect it to an actual server? 
Not using firebase, I want to use ejabberd. The place where I'm an intern are using AWS.
What is the Java code to connect with the server?
How do I go about ejabberd?
## [12][Transferring app to new Play account, what happens with purchase validation API calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fmtab1/transferring_app_to_new_play_account_what_happens/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fmtab1/transferring_app_to_new_play_account_what_happens/

We are transferring an app to a new Google Play Developer Account because of Google's ridiculous policy of not being able to change the email address associated with the Play account owner.

If you recall, in app purchases get validated server-side, and the server has a private key that is tied to a service account created in a Google API Console project (which is subsequently linked to the Google Play Developer account).

When the app is transferred to the new Google Play Developer account, **what happens with the existing Google API Console project?** Will in-app purchases just start failing until the new account creates and deploys its own API Console project? Does the old project get linked to the new account?
