After about a year of development, I'm finally releasing Bumbag v1. Bumbag is an accessible &amp; themeable React UI Kit that allows you to rapidly build React applications whether it be an MVP or a large-scale application.

Last year I started learning React and javascript and after months of practice, I got a job. But I was fired because I was unable to perform some simple array manipulations. Now I am thinking what should I do? I was a PHP developer but I have forgotten all that and my sole focus was javascript. Now I don't know where to go from here. I am heartbroken, afraid I will never be a developer or a good one to get a living. I honestly don't know where to go from here.

Hi there,

For the past month or so I've been working on my first React project using the framework Next.js to build the front end to a small service called [Notify.is](https://notify.is) which notifies you when your favourite username on Instagram, Twitter or GitHub becomes available.

The backend uses Go to deal with RESTful API routes for signing up and deleting data. I've had a lot of fun building it and would love any feedback on the design, code or anything else. Also, trying out the service would be helpful for me finding any bugs I have not yet found.

The frontend and backend are deployed using Vercel and the GitHub repository can be found here:

[https://github.com/oliverproud/notify.is](https://github.com/oliverproud/notify.is)

The Go code that checks with the respective services is deployed in a Docker container on Google Cloud Run and you can find the GitHub repository for that here:

[https://github.com/oliverproud/notify.is-gcloud](https://github.com/oliverproud/notify.is-gcloud)

The website:

[https://notify.is](https://notify.is)

Let me know what you think!
