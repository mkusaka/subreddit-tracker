Iâ€™m starting my Ruby on Rails focused coding bootcamp in London in July and I would like to get a head start.   

What are the best online resources or books to learn Ruby and Rails?

Do you have any useful plugins or suggestions on how to do it? Ideally I would probably want to auto-format whole file, but the tools to do so are not quire there yet. At the moment pasting some nested structures from console to test files is quite a pain.
## [5][Connecting to API doesn't work via Ruby? (feat. Stripe)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/g6y77h/connecting_to_api_doesnt_work_via_ruby_feat_stripe/)

Hi Redditors, I expect this will be working as I connect to their API keys but there is no update received. I think api key hasn't been connected... but What have I done wrong?

&lt;code&gt;  


`require 'sinatra'`

`require 'stripe'`

&amp;#x200B;

`Stripe.api_key = ENV['rk_test_Hiia....']`

`endpoint_secret = ENV['sk_test_WUkA....']`

&amp;#x200B;

`Stripe::WebhookEndpoint.create({`

`url: '`[`https://example.com/test`](https://example.com/test)`',`

`enabled_events: [`

`'charge.succeeded',`

`],`

`})`

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

Which om those is a good way to get on steam with ruby again.

I have not done ruby and Ruby on Rails for some years now.
