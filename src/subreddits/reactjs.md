With the introduction of Hooks and Context API, have class-based components lost their worth as the go-to option for smart-components or is it still better to use them to handle fetching/updating/removal of data and as parent-components.

Also, can an entire application be created using just functional components? If so, then is Redux even worth using?

 **Live today: 1 PM ET** 

Get calendar invites and/or join broadcast: [https://www.telerik.com/react-wednesdays](https://www.telerik.com/react-wednesdays) 

Craig Dunn and Keil Aloia from the Microsoft Surface Duo team show how to build React Native apps for the Duo, then we‚Äôll ask them a bunch of questions‚Äîlike, why is Microsoft investing in React Native and what is Android doing to help support dual-screen devices? 

* Are you fascinated by phones with two screens? 
* Have you ever wondered about what it‚Äôs like to build a dual-screen app?
* Are you very confused by folding phones and want to see one live? 

The device ships tomorrow (Sept 10th). **Get early info today.**

We'll end by asking each guest if folding phones are the future or a fad, and 10 years from now we‚Äôll laugh at everyone that gets it wrong.

## [10][history.push doesn't reload navbar](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iq04jn/historypush_doesnt_reload_navbar/)

Hi all, when history.push is called on login, the location changes but the Navbar doesn't seem to reload When i login, I would like the login and signup links to change to cart and logout.

Thanks!

    // app.js
    function App() {
      return (
        &lt;Router history={history}&gt;
          &lt;Layout&gt;

             &lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home} /&gt;					
              &lt;Route path="/shop" component={Shop} /&gt;

I've learned how "this" refers to the object which called the function, and how arrow functions make "this" implicitly bound so that it always refers to the object which defines the function, but every tutorial I look at has one or two examples but I need something that compares different scenarios and says why "this" is different in each of them  


 I need something which gives examples for about 6-8 use cases that would look something like  


Example 1

    some code
    let func = someFunction(
        this.someVariable
    )

What is this?: \_\_\_\_\_\_

The answer is \_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example 2

    some code
    this.someFunction()

What is this?: \_\_\_\_\_\_

The answer is \_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example 3
