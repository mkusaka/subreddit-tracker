Foal TS framework version 1.5 is officially released!

LinkedIn and Github social support, customizable exception handler, higher CSRF protection, discover the new features of version 1.5 here: [https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/releases/tag/v1.5.0](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

[Foal TS - January release \(version 1.5\)](https://preview.redd.it/jlt8b9k9g4b41.png?width=1054&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b7b4c2bd0897a5e7ea14e6bfdd5a1bdce2d79b8)

Foal, in a few words, it's a Node.js framework:

* written in TypeScript
* supplied with batteries included (Auth, OpenAPI, GraphQL, ORM, CLI, ...)
* and with a simple and intuitive architecture (no over-engineering).

And the must: it has more than 11,000 lines of documentation.

I started to test my logic skills in CodeWars, but CodeWars don't accept latest version of ecma. There is a way to my eslint or typescript shows me a warning or error when I write a function or somethint that doesn't exist or is not accepted in ecma6?

&amp;#x200B;

To answer curiosity I'm using VSCODE.
## [5][Is there a way to deconstruct params AND define the interface in a single call?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/epen4f/is_there_a_way_to_deconstruct_params_and_define/)

No destructuring

```

function printName(param: {firstName: string, lastName: string}) {

console.log(param.firstName + ' ' + param.lastName)

}

```

&amp;#x200B;

Define interface

```interface Name {

firstName: string,

lastName: string

}

function printName(param: Name) {

console.log(param.firstName + ' ' + param.lastName)

}

```

&amp;#x200B;

Destructuring + Inline Interface

```

function printName({ firstName, lastName }: { firstName: string; lastName: string }) {

console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName)

}

```

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm wondering, is there a way to have destructuring so that I don't need to call param.&lt;something&gt;, but at the same time having it inline? Perhaps something like this:

```

function printName({ firstName: string; lastName: string }) {

console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName)

}

```

Destructuring + Inline Interface is kinda annoying because you need to redeclare everything twice. Is there anything I can write that does destructuring but also defines the type at the same time?

As the title says, I want to share [this small Fitbit app](https://github.com/Shpota/zeit) with you. I posted it in this sub when I initially created it, but since then I changed the app, applied improvements, released it to the store, and got feedback from users. 

It is my pet project and I don't use TypeScript at work that's why I was glad that I could implement applications like this with TypeScript.

I would love to get any kind of feedback

## [7][One hidden benefit of TS I haven't seen discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ep8h1v/one_hidden_benefit_of_ts_i_havent_seen_discussed/)

Example documentation:

    get(options?: GetOptions): Promise&lt;DocumentSnapshot&lt;T&gt;&gt;

In all the courses I took and all the toy projects I built my first 2 years, none of them ever explained what the above was. I sort of understood what something like `.set(path [, options])` after much time and frustration. But the above was another level.

Once could guess the meaning of ? and probably pick up the type hinting after learning a 2nd language, but that final bit with the Promise and generic was always a source of pain and confusion.

Feels like a large gap in the current educational landscape to be honest. TS fills it perfectly because by some magical coincidence it seems to match most complex documentation's syntax exactly.

Finally, I can read!

I thought I would know this, having worked with TS for 2 months now. But I'm running into issues:

    export enum RuleTypes {global, inventory, product, blacklist}
    
    export interface GlobalRuleSchema {
      storeId: string
      , globalPercent : number
    }
    
    // inside a class
      verifySchemaIsCorrect(type: RuleTypes, recordData: unknown) {
        let schemaMatches: boolean;
        
        switch (+type) { // + needed for number coercion as per SO
          case type.global: // TS2339: Property 'global' does not exist on type 'RuleTypes'.
            schemaMatches = typeof recordData === GlobalRuleSchema; // TS2693: 'GlobalRuleSchema' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here
            break;
          default:
            schemaMatches = false;
        }    
    
        if (Boolean(schemaMatches)) {
          return true;
        }
        
        throw Error("recordData's shape is wrong against its schema");
      }

What is the correct way to ensure the interface on `recordData` matches the desired enum value on `type` ?

I'm creating some schemas for Cloud Firestore and was curious if there are best practices for grouping interfaces. 

I don't think they can be grouped inside a class so is there any other way to encapsulate them together? 

Also, at the file level what do you guys do?

I'm currently putting them in /shared/interfaces.ts. My project's scope is relatively small and has both the back and front end in other folders. I thought it would be good for both ends to share the interface file so that they adhere to the same type definitions.
