Starting a monthly newsletter on Ruby on Rails, React and GraphQL developers to read about some cool stuff happening in the community.

In a month we come across a lot cool stuff happening in the community, learn new things and contribute to the open-source world and newsletters is the best way to share some of those finding/blogs/videos.

This newsletter would consist of the following things:

* Dev Joke
* My Blogs.
* Reading/watching list.
* Open-source libraries/contributions.
* Rails changelog.
* Watching/Reading/Reviews.

I’m wondering if there’s a library for rails or a rails native implementation of https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/expressions/#f-expressions

EDIT:
Essentially I’m wanting to increment the number value of a field/value by 1 on multiple model instances.

I'm trying to make a webgame just for fun and start to learn how to make websites, i understand the basic things: HTML is the website, CSS is for make it very cool and Javascript is for animations, process data, etc. Well a simple summary, let me know if i have some bad concept please.

Now i don't understand how to run code(a simple bucle) in the server side, maybe i need a extended library but i would like to use RoR only. I would like if someone guide me for a good simple way to do what i need.

I use RoR because programming is my hobby and i've only done things in Ruby, i have used socket for Ruby to make a simple MMORPG and works fine, that's my experience.

Something to send messages to clients from server side(gameloop) and using javascript to apply the changes in client side.
## [8][Advice on using GraphQL for an admin dashboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hxqva1/advice_on_using_graphql_for_an_admin_dashboard/)

The app at my company is a Rails REST API. Recently we've started working on a standalone admin dashboard, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to architect it. Each of our clients has a separate server, so this admin dashboard will be hitting many different servers (not sure if that's relevant).

I've read a bit about GraphQL, and think it might offer a unique solution for us here. Rather than having to update the controllers on the API side every time a new admin task is required, would GraphQL allow us to change the requirements from the admin dashboard side? I've never used it and just want to make sure that I have the right idea about it before digging in. From what I've read, it sounds like we can have a very wide-open POST endpoint that will allow whichever updates are necessary, which sounds like a great solution for an admin dashboard.

Because we don't already use it, do you think it would add enough benefit for this use-case, or should we just stick with REST controllers?

We're planning on using Vue to build out the frontend for this dashboard, and if we use GraphQL, I suppose we'll be using Apollo.  


EDIT:

Thanks for the advice. It sounds like GraphQL isn't going to be much benefit in this case.
## [9][What's the 'Rails' way of writing clean code (and adhering to the single responsibility principle)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hxl330/whats_the_rails_way_of_writing_clean_code_and/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hxl330/whats_the_rails_way_of_writing_clean_code_and/

I just finished the [lesson 1 of writing clean code by "Uncle Bob"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM), and my biggest takeaway was the single responsibility principle — that "a function does one thing only" — and "polite code": all lines in a function should be on the same abstraction level, and they should call functions on a lower abstraction level, going all the way down to implementation.

It's like newspaper: you read the heading to see what it's about; if you're interesting in learning more, you read the first paragraph; then the next; etc. It's being polite to the person trying to understand the codebase — they can take a look at the high-level function and understand its purpose without having to learn the unnecessary details in the process.

His way of avoiding thousands of little functions as a result of this was to put everything into its own class, and to find those sometimes-non-obvious classes. In a Java-like language, that makes sense, but should we do the same in Ruby on Rails?

I'm a beginner at Rails, but from what I can see it has a pretty strict structure ("convention over configuration") of MVC, where each "C" has several actions where the code goes. Should we split that code into other classes and compose everything inside the action? Or is there some other, better, more "Rails" way of doing things?
## [10][Scope not working now I have migrated address data to a separate model](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hxq92n/scope_not_working_now_i_have_migrated_address/)

Hello,  


I used to have just one model, `Venue`, which had an attribute called `address`, as well as a `longitude` and a `latitude` value.  


But I decided to move all this to a separate model, `Address`, which `belongs_to :venue`.  


Now, I had a scope set up for my old Venue model, which is now broken.  


Here's the test for it:

    it 'returns an ActiveRecord::Relation of venues which have addresses near given location' do
      venue = create(:venue, user: create(:user) )
      address = create(:address, venue: ven)
            
      expect(Venue.location("UK")).to eq([venue])
    end

  
Here's what the scope used to look like:

    scope :location, -&gt; location { near(location) }

And here's  where I'm up to writing the new scope:

    scope :location, -&gt; location { where(Address.near(location)) }

I'm getting the following error when run the test for my new scope:

    Unsupported argument type: #&lt;Address::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x00007f95df7bbb60&gt; (Address::ActiveRecord_Relation)

  
Now, I think I know why this is happening, because I actually want my scope to return all the venues which have associated addresses which return from the `.near(location)` search.

But I'm actually getting the `Address` instances themselves returned.  


So my question is, how do I fix this so that I'm getting `Venues` returned and not `Addresses` (assuming this is my problem). If that's not what the issue is, any other help would be appreciated.  


Thanks.

Hello Everyone,

I'm new to ruby on rails and I'm trying to build a web app that lets me subscribe to a topic through mqtt and recieve a payload from a simulated node-red IoT device that send de data to AWS IoT core. So what I'm trying to do is to have a web page that lets me click on a subscribe button and I can start getting data from the simulated device. My question is first of all if this is possible and second can somebody guide me to where I can learn to do this.

Notes: What I've found is that for ruby there are gems for mqtt. But I'm not sure how to integrate with the web page. I've already sent a payload using irb and it was succesful. This is the repo I'm using: [njh/ruby-mqtt](https://github.com/njh/ruby-mqtt)

Thanks.
