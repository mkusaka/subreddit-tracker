I have been studying Golang for some weeks. I love how simple and beautiful the things in Go are. But I don't know if it's hard to find a job in Go. What do you guys think about it?  

By the way, I've already known programming. I had experience with C, Python, Kotlin, and Javascript (NodeJS). (no job experience, just in the college and in projects).

I'd like to be a backend developer. I'm enjoying learning about Docker and Kubernetes as well. I kind of really need a job (or an internship) until the end of the first semester of 2021.

Thanks!!

I see go-cmp as an option for comparison. But was looking for another alternative to compare json/structs or maps[string]interface{}

Issues with go-cmp:
1) doesn't have a rich documentation on how to customise diff. Eg -Ignore fields starting with a character

2) Have seen frequent panics in production.

Hello,

I am testing a protptype single board computer for remote data monitoring in one of our customers. I prepared a simple no dependency lightweight telegram bot with go to see our application logs in telegram since our customer couldn't provide a static ip for remote access.

Please review and comment, i am learning a lot from your feedbacks.

Best regards
## [9][How to do error tracing](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/jctq7b/how_to_do_error_tracing/)

Hi guys, I'm building a **small** web server, regarding the clean-arch philosophy.

It's a small app, so I don't want to over-engineering something, like using a distributed system or something like that, but k8s could be my deployment choice. 

I want to attach a request ID to every request and pass it all the way to the DB access layer and log everything with this request ID, such I can track the whole process if the user submits the request ID(Iâ€™ll send the request ID as a field in response JSON and display it to the user just like FB does)

While I'm using echov4, I can install the request ID middleware, extract the ID, bind it with logger and pass it way down.

But I'm worried if these IDs will ever collide, I have seen someone using opentrace, Zipkin, etc
. But they are for the distributed system.

Any suggestions will be welcomed! ðŸ˜‰

Edit: the title should be about tracking, not tracing.
