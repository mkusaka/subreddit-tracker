Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Do you guys throw the whole kitchen sink in? Do you disable specific checks if you don't agree with them/if they don't fit? Or do you only pick certain groups of checks from the beginning? Curious about what may be standard.

As far as I'm concerned the world of C++ has the top minds in programming/computer science.

I'll watch anything with Bjarne in it. And I've consumed hours and hours of CPPCon videos.

Any recent such videos where I can learn about programming philosophy, rather than just the technical specs of an aspect inherent to C++?

I think i've exhausted all of CPPCON 2019  


If it's 'grill the commitee' type stuff, I'm good with that too!

Many thanks

## [10][Fall through on switch case - warnings?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ezi4ik/fall_through_on_switch_case_warnings/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ezi4ik/fall_through_on_switch_case_warnings/

So, for years, in both c and c++, I've used a technique where a `case:` does a bunch of stuff, call it `X`, and the `case:` above it needs to do exactly that, plus `Y` stuff, so I put the `Y` in the upper `case:` and let it fall through to the `X` case. It's always worked great, never had a problem.

So I went to port a relatively large app \([this one](http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html)\) from OSX, where I developed it, to Windows. Installed Qt, built it, the qt install picked a compiler \(mingw\), etc., and off I went to cross-compile.

The new compiler, predictably, went at things a little differently, and TBH, it caught a few things I was glad to have caught. So far so good.

But it also pushed warnings about my fall-through `case:` statements, and looking at them, they were doing just what I had intended. I hadn't yet found a way to switch the warnings off \(laptop is off getting more RAM and an SSD, so I can't even look at it today\) but probably there's a way.

So what I'm asking, though, is what folks think of this technique. Apparently, the compiler authors think I shouldn't be doing this. Anyone agree? Disagree? Other? If I can turn this off, should I? Yes? No? Other?

TIA.

\[**EDIT:** End goal is zero errors, zero warnings, always. I can just code this differently, two cases plus an if inside the case, for instance... it just seems inelegant.\]

Hello,

Can you suggest me some library with the following constraints?

* Cross platform (windows, Linux, Android )
* Light
* Socket
* Usable in closed source projects

Thanks!
