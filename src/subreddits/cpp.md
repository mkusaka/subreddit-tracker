**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

Registration is still open. SYCL is an open standard for heterogeneous programming in C++.

Hey guys!

I hope I'm not asking a regularly answered question. At least I didn't find anything matching in this sub. So here goes:

Are any of you aware of some kind of series (blog posts, YouTube videos, ...) that cover examples of "excellently designed" C++ libraries or applications and discuss what makes them so good?
I'm aware of various books on software architecture etc, but personally learn a lot from "real" examples as well. 

Maybe some of you also have suggestions for libraries to look at and some bullet points about what you think makes them well-designed. 

Thank you for your time in advance!

Hi there!

Does anyone can inform whether N4861 is the last C++20 draft that we can use as reference on what was approved as FEATURE COMPLETE?

Tks!

C++ has a very powerful type system that allows to express a lot of concepts at compile time. In particular, with generics and constexpr, you can achieve some sort of dependent typing like the following:

`template&lt;size_t A, size_t B&gt;`  
`String&lt;A+B&gt; concat(String&lt;A&gt;, String&lt;B&gt;) //Where String&lt;N&gt; is a string of N chars`

I was wondering where can I find information about how these parts of the type system have been built (e.g. RFCs, design documents, committees). Moreover, I am also looking for (although I don't know if they exist) theoretical papers that correspond to the type system of C++.

Finally, if by any chance somone knows other languages that offer these sort of integer generics I would also be interested (I only know "const generics" in Rust and is still under development).

Thanks!

Are there any decent game engines where the source code is available to look at and that are in C++17?

(Urho3D and UnrealEngine are both still on C++11/14, right?). Thanks for any pointers!
