Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i6yqng/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

## The Virtual World Podcast
Hey, folks. Just dropped the newest episode of my podcast, The Virtual World. Join me and my friend, Jay Helton, as we pick the brain of Tim McNamara. Tim is the author of Rust in Action, and we had the wonderful opportunity to sit down and ask him everything we could about Rust, his book Rust in Action, and anything else that came to our caffeine-addled minds.

### Discount Code/Free Copies
I have 5 free copies of his book to give out, so please reach out to me here or on twitter if you are interested. 

Don't forget to use the podcast's discount code *podvworld20* for *35%* off of every product in Manning Publications store.

It can be hard to debug the spans on code generated by procedural macros, so I wrote this tool to help with that!

https://github.com/Diggsey/spanr

Simply add a call to `spanr::save_html` from your procedural macro, and it will do the rest.
## [7][TIL that a weakly referenced Rc is dropped but not freed](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ii21t4/til_that_a_weakly_referenced_rc_is_dropped_but/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ii21t4/til_that_a_weakly_referenced_rc_is_dropped_but/
---
My unfounded assumption about how weak references in Rc was that it'd contain a strong reference count and a linked list of `Weak&lt;T&gt;` that'd be traversed and zeroed when the last strong is dropped. (Come to think of it, that'd need Weak to be Pinned, so it wouldn't have been a very practical design anyway).

Reading up code of `Rc::new_cyclic` in [TWIR](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2020/08/26/this-week-in-rust-353/), I learned that there's just a weak count in parallel to the strong count, and that the inner gets dropped in place. But the actual memory freeing is delayed so the weak references have something to point to while they exist, even though they only use the first two words.

I wonder, if for large `T` and long-lived `Weak&lt;T&gt;`, does it make sense to use `Rc&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;`?

Hi, 

I'm searching for very fast and accurate(no duplicated entries for different files) to create duplicate file finder and destroyer(inspired by fslint but for now only CLI).

I'm curious which algorithm is the fastest to compute file hash, because I can't find any benchmark with Rust implementations.
