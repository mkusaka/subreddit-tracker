Hey folks, I want to share it with you a video I made: [https://youtu.be/27QbUycVrHg](https://youtu.be/27QbUycVrHg) about Webpack 5 Federated Module for a fully dynamic environment.

I hope you find this useful, I worked in multiple apps that couldn't scale due to the organization structure and this feature will enable a clean solution for them to scale better.

I am working on some platform using Material UI and React that will give you a better starting point for some of these enterprise apps, stay tuned about that one.

I am still learning how to make videos, so I would appreciate a lot your constructive criticisms.

Cheers,

Hi champs

i  have started reactjs  for a while and started learning hooks. i am trying to make a simple todo app in react without using useEffect and useReducers and use Context. below i am providing only edit button section ...i am stuck here for a day....

my problem is edit button is not working. when i press the button it's not editing anything

you can find the whole code in [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/condescending-worker-s0igh)

TodoList,js:

 

import React from "react";  
const TodoItem = ({ id, title, completed, editItem }) =&gt; {  
 return (  
 &lt;div style={{ width: 400, height: 25 }}&gt;  
&lt;input type="checkbox" checked={completed} /&gt;  
 {title}  
&lt;button  
 style={{ float: "right" }}  
 value={id}  
 onClick={() =&gt; editItem({ title })}  
 \&gt;  
Edit  
&lt;/button&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
 );  
};  
const TodoList = ({ items = \[\], editItem }) =&gt; {  
 return items.map(p =&gt; &lt;TodoItem {...p} key={p.id} editItem={editItem} /&gt;);  
};  
export default TodoList;  


&amp;#x200B;

and App.js is:

&amp;#x200B;

 

import React, { useState } from "react";  
import TodoList from "./TodoList";  
import "./styles.css";  
const defaultItems = \[  
 { id: 1, title: "Write React Todo Project", completed: true },  
 { id: 2, title: "Upload it to github", completed: false }  
\];  
export default function App() {  
 const \[items, setItems\] = useState(defaultItems);  
 const editItem = ({ id, title }) =&gt; {  
 setItems(oldItems =&gt;  
 oldItems.map(p =&gt; (p.id === id ? { ...p, title } : p))  
 );  
 };  
 return (  
 &lt;div style={{ width: 400 }}&gt;  
&lt;hr /&gt;  
&lt;TodoList items={items} editItem={editItem} /&gt;  
&lt;hr /&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
 );  
}
