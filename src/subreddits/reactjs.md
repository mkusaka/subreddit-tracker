We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi guys, so Iâ€™m creating an e-commerce platform and I wanted to get your opinions on using either redux thunk or redux saga, because they both do the same thing but I think saga letâ€™s you control what happens more than thunk.. Id love to hear your opinions on why either would be better and the useCases for both as I am still in the process of learning all the quirks react has to offer :)

Hello guys and gals I am a long time angular dev started working on react native about 3 years ago  and since then switched to react.

Worked on a few react projects where each screen was driven by an api endpoint and had no need for state management.

I am about to start a new one where the data flow is more complex and I have integrated redux toolkit as state management.


1) In your opinion is redux toolkit the best state management solution.

2) Do you keep everything in the state? Routing? Let's say a user is typing in a text box do you record that in a slice?

3) what are some pitfalls you had with state management I should try to avoid.

I'm a little bit losted coming from Rails to React/Firebase. I have the following realtime database structure. As you can see, a product can have a brand and multiple sellers.

If a brand is `true`, i'd like to get / display the brand contents on my page (the avatar, name, link etc.). Same for the sellers.

Right now, if i try to display the brand content, i get "true" when i'd like an object containing the infos i've stored in `brands` or `sellers`.

So i'd like for example to be able to do something like this : 
`&lt;p&gt;{this.props.brands.name}&lt;/p&gt;` (it can only have one brand for now)

As for the sellers i'd like for example to be able to do something like this :
```
this.state.sellers.map((seller) =&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src={seller.avatar} /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{seller.name}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
);
```

Here is my firebase realtime database structure (json) :

```

## [9][How to show cookie message only once?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hxhdbd/how_to_show_cookie_message_only_once/)

Hello all!  


I want to show a message telling about cookies only the very first time a user enters the website. Until the user closes the message, it will appear every time he enters into the website. After closing the message, it should not appear anymore.

Please, can someone point me out what are the steps do I need to do for this? Does people normally use browser's local storage for this? Does someone has an example of this by any chance?  


Thank you very much and regards.

Currently I have a create-react-app frontend and Flask backend hosted separately on heroku. I am able to get a JSON file when I type [www.example.herokuapp.com/bob](https://www.example.herokuapp.com/bob), but when I try to do use postman to make get requests to that link, it just returns 200 error and my index.html file from build. Can someone help with this?

EDIT: Seems like the issue is due to the asynchronous nature of the calls, and how GET requests do not "await" for the JSON returned from the promise
