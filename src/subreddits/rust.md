Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hynlfl/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Actually I'm about to learn some Rust and i wanted to discover how to build a terminal based GUI. First I just used plain Rust without any special crates. It worked good enough to code some list displays, a kind of directory view. Then i tried out Termion which is really easy to use and I ended up making a Tetris game. It took me two programming sessions to complete this actual state, like 4 hours or a bit more in addition. This Tetris is playable with all basic features but that's it. I don't want to add more features like a Score or "next Tetromino Display" or something like that, because it was just a little side project to discover some  Terminal GUI programming with Rust. But feel free to check out my Code on [Github](https://github.com/DrTosh/tetris) and add your desired feature if you want. And don't forget to leave me your thoughts I would appreciate that ;D

Pixels 0.2.0 just landed. ðŸŽ‰ This release focuses on further improvements to the custom shader API, and upgrades `wgpu` to 0.6.0.

[https://github.com/parasyte/pixels](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels)

This is the crate to use for emulators and old-school pixel-pushing. Especially if you want the full power of your GPU hardware for scaling and adding special effects to your raw pixel buffer.

## Featured game

[**Sandbox**](https://github.com/JMS55/sandbox) is a sand simulation game using `pixels`. It has a custom shader to add a glow effect. Check it out!

SOLVED!

A crate called \`passwors\` broke the compilation process.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting this weird error message

    error[E0463]: can't find crate for `syntax`
      --&gt; /home/lifeordeath/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/aster-0.27.0/src/lib.rs:10:1

    10 | extern crate syntax;
       | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't find crate
    
    error: aborting due to previous error

when trying to compile a program that uses [rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs) and [diesel.rs](https://diesel.rs), but I can't for the life of me figure out what the syntax crate is.
