## [2][I've been using Typescript (migrated after 15 years of Java) for about 1.5 years. Here's what I've learned and how my programming style has changed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/itmcvp/ive_been_using_typescript_migrated_after_15_years/)

- I've found I really like inner functions.  I'll put functions within functions to group similar code.  In Java this wasn't possible (at least 8 ... haven't checked lately).  It's better to keep things close together especially if the function isn't reusable.

- I'm calling all interfaces as IFoo rather than just Foo. Interfaces are a bit different than in Java and are far more important.

- Almost all my code is migrating to namespaces and I'm migrating almost entirely from static functions and static classes.  Webpack can't tree shake them and I think this is just cleaner either way.

- I'm moving to a lot more functions, maps, streams, etc.  

- I use undefined a lot more than null.  

- Types and generics work pretty well but every once in a while I get stuck and they can kind of get confusing with edge cases.

Curious how it's changed your programming style.

In short, what I'd like to do:

```
class Person {

  name: string

  // dynamic properties from constructor param


  constructor(name: string, dynProps: any) {

    this.name = name

    Object.keys(dynProps).forEach(key =&gt; this[key] = dynProps[key]) 

 } 

}


const dynamicProperties = { age: 25 } 


const someone = new Person('Greg', dynamicProperties)


someone.name // 'Greg'

someone.age // it should aknowledge it as number type and return 25
```

    Missing baseUrl in compilerOptions. tsconfig-paths will be skipped

I am wondering if it's something I should have or not.

&gt;Type '{ children: string; for: string; }' is not assignable to type 'DetailedHTMLProps&lt;LabelHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLLabelElement&gt;, HTMLLabelElement&gt;'.  
&gt;  
&gt;  Property 'for' does not exist on type 'DetailedHTMLProps&lt;LabelHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLLabelElement&gt;, HTMLLabelElement&gt;'. Did you mean 'htmlFor'?

Hmm, why am I getting a type error on a html attribute?

Hey everyone, I'm trying to type a map like class and I'm not sure if it's possible to do it the way I want it to work. Essentially what I want is this:

```
factory.define('user', UserModel, { /* ... default values for the UserModel */ } )

factory.create('user', { /* ... UserModel fields to override */ }): UserModel
```

In the `define` method you specify a key string, a type it matches to and some default values. Then in `create` TS understand that the `'user'` key means that the second parameter must be of type `UserModel`, and it returns a `UserModel`.

I don't want to have to define all the keys (`'user'` in this case) as a type ahead of time, I want to define the methods such that typescript understands that the `define` parameters are setting keys and values. Anyone know if this is possible, and if so, how?

Many thanks for your help!

Edit 1: updated to a better explaining example.

basically, I want to limit the length of the `coordinates` parameter in the `getDirection` function.

how do I force the caller to pass an array of `LatLng` with a minimum length of 2 and a maximum elements of 25?

  
please take a look at my codes below

&amp;#x200B;

    interface LatLng {
     lat: number
     lng: number
    }
    
    const getDirection = async (coordinates: LatLng[]) {
    
    }

Iv'e seen tuple examples but it looks like it's only for setting a minimum or fixed length of elements.
