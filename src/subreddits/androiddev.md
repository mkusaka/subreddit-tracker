This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I am waiting for Android R Beta release in a month or two so I can see what direction they took with the scoped storage.  So I am not targetting Android Q yet and haven't implemented any of those scoped storage changes.  I wonder how many other apps are doing the same

I'm using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) and it uses Hyper-V. The AMD Hypervisor is not able to work at the same time with it, but the WHPX can.

My app has a fair share of user base from Brazil &amp; Germany. I'm considering translating my app to Brazilian Portuguese &amp; German. Right now the app is available in English only.
Is it worth doing the translation? How popular is English in these countries? What is the primary language in their mobile phones in these countries?
Anybody from these countries can chime in? 
Thanks in advance.

Android job interview became truly ridiculous there days!

Android SDK is so huge and is getting bigger, add old school Java (one day I stepped upon a vipers nest "job opportunity" - the very 1st question was "what are all methods of java.lang.Object.java" and I immediately run away from those freaks), new school Kotlin maddness, add Android BLE quirks, backward compatibility here, forward compatiblity there and you get insane.

Next time I get the feeling that the person I'm talking with is trying to be a smart-ass I want to tell him "listen, Android SDK is X milions of lines of code and you're trying to ask me about one of it, are you feeling ok?"

Can you people tell me what is X?

## [8][Is there any cloud service supporting the SAF's ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ex4i1f/is_there_any_cloud_service_supporting_the_safs/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ex4i1f/is_there_any_cloud_service_supporting_the_safs/
---
In particular, and to my dismay, Google Drive does not support `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`, thus you cannot pick a folder on Google Drive (for example for saving a file in it). That's incomprehensible since you can open a file with Google Drive with the SAF using `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`. 
So you cannot save a file to Google Drive with the SAF (unless I missed something) but you can open files from it. Makes total sense...
Is there any cloud provider (or anything else than local storage) that has implemented `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` ?

## [10][App not listed in App drawer after installing using USB and Android Studio](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ex60bg/app_not_listed_in_app_drawer_after_installing/)

Hello everyone,

I test and debug an app I currently work on, on my mobile phone. To install it, I connected it with an USB cable with the PC, enabled the USB debugging settings on my phone and installed it using Android Studio.

However, for some reason, it does get installed, works and runs completely fine, but doesn't appear in the App drawer where all Apps are usually listed. Any idea why this is the case?

If you need any technical information, like settings on my mobile phone or source code, tell me! :) Thanks for any help!

Dear friends, 

Can you give some advices/ideas about how&amp;where to get fast response for easy questions or to hangout for those of us that are learning android by themselves, that are not in school anymore or doesn't have programmers colleagues.

I'm trying to learn Kotlin for android by myself and I'll like to join some real-time chat communities like irc or something like that.
