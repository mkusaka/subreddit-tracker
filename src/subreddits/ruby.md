## [1][Tokens -- Is there a list of reserved tokens for Ruby's syntax?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gna19o/tokens_is_there_a_list_of_reserved_tokens_for/)

I need list for the reserved tokens Ruby has.

For example, in the expression `"hello " &lt;&lt; "world"`, `&lt;&lt;` is a method of the `String` class, not a token.

I have seen the JIT in the MRI, but I want to see the produced C file, how can I do this?

I’m currently in rolled in a boot camp and I’m doing the course prework. They didn’t go over iterations and nested arrays well enough for me to fully understand it. 

Is there a good resource someone could point me to? 

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you all for your help!! I was able use .flatten on them once I sorted and got the strings out. Ruby has been a pain to learn via the schools curriculum.
