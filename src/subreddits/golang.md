Hi folks!

Just for some background info, I'm looking at basically trying to run a bash script within my Go app. Now whilst there's some really nice tools out there that can embedd this in for me, like Go-bindata. I think found a very hacky way of doing it inside the the actual script. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/63248f281f55698b520137d477631e87a3b02c4f/hack/e2e.go#L418) within the Kubernetes repo, and thought this looks about right. 

Basically they call the function `bashwrap` which has the bash code and then they process it. Would someone be able to explain to me how the `runBashUntil` works. As I really can't grasp how they're executing it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is appreciated!

Hi everyone. I'm scouting for the best language choice for a project, and curious about real-world experiences of using Go-generated WASM for browser-delivered web applications. Anyone has any insights to share from such a project?  Would you do it again?

I'm purposefully casting the net a bit wide here ðŸ™‚ It's just been hard to know if there are any unknown unknowns to be aware of. I'm also a little concerned for the future of WASM support in Go.
