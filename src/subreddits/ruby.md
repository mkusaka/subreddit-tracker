I am following a ruby tutorial, and in the tutorial the instructor says if I want  to print out a string concatenated with a variable I need a parenthesis around the whole thing like this:

    name = "Joe"
    puts ("Hello my name is " + name)

However when I try this

    name = "Joe"
    puts "Hello my name is " + name

I don't get an error and the program runs fine. Is the instructor wrong? do I not need  the parenthesis?
## [2][How to add class and method to rails logger](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/flwc21/how_to_add_class_and_method_to_rails_logger/)

I have a rails app I want to add a custom log formatter to.  In the logs, I want to dynamically show the class where code was called and the method that called it.  Currently, in the initialize method of classes in my app I'm doing \`@logger = self.progname\` to get the class and \`@logger.level("#{\_\_callee\_\_}: some message"\` to  get the method.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can write a custom logging class and assign it to \`config.log\_formatter\` in .../config/environments/production.rb which is fine but how can I add a formatter that will dynamically tell me what class and what method I'm in when I log stuff?

If I have an array like \[1, 3\]  I wish to build a string as 

    "id: 1 OR id: 3"

Could you tell me what the cleanest way to do it is in ruby? 

I was thinking of MAP and JOIN but it wasn't looking clean when i had to avoid the last OR

MANY), IRC Bots, and many other interesting things. There may even be a  
funny story or two from the guys.
