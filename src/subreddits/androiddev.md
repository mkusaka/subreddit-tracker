Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!

Let's get right into it. Recent events have lead to a lot of debate and deliberation internally and externally. I'd like to reach out to everyone and open a dialogue between us and the community.

We will not be allowing several posts discussing the subreddit and past events, this is not the proper method to reach us, and I don't want to stifle or drown out the great discussion that happens here with too many posts. Instead, I'd like to open this thread as a place to discuss. In response to past events I would like to state the following will be happening in short order.

 * We will be restructuring our leadership internally as some mods have differing activity levels and some wish to retire. We recognize that we are also severely understaffed which is hurting our ability to serve the community, so we will soon be recruiting additional volunteers from the community to help out. More on this will be announced soon.

 * Any action we take is as a team. At the end of the day we are volunteers doing this in our free time with the best interests of our community in mind. With everything that is going on in the world right now, now is not time for bickering, from anyone. Now is the time for coming together and solving problems. Remember that everyone is a human being. Harassment is zero tolerance.

 * In response to the above point, I would like to ask for everyone's feedback on our current rule set in the comment below. Please keep the discussion calm and collected, or it will be unproductive and removed. I am however encouraging everyone to provide their feedback and suggestions on how we can improve our community.

Expect to see more from me personally as I take a bigger role in trying to help restructure our team and improve our community. 

Have a great day everyone!

## [4][Did Rich Text Formatting sink my Play Store listing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gx317h/did_rich_text_formatting_sink_my_play_store/)

I’ve started to have a proper look at ASO over the last few weeks and I’ve been making changes to my store listings (title, description etc). I was making small progresses here and there and I’d started ranking on some lesser searched for keywords and phrases. All good. All going in the right direction.

I then read a few articles on using rich text formatting in the descriptions and I though I’d give that a go and try and emphasise and bump up the importance of certain words and phrases. So a week ago I started to use header tags, bold tags, italics etc throughout the descriptions.

Since then my listings have dropped off completely and I’m no longer ranking for these words or phrases - or anything else for that matter. According to AppAnnie’s free ASO keyword tool I no longer rank for any word or phrase.

So I’m guessing this is all thanks to the rich text formatting that my keywords and phrases (and app in a whole) no longer rank. Either that or Google takes longer to index pages with RTF.

Does anyone else have similar experiences with RTF, or apps that completely dropped off the rankings for similar reasons?

## [6][Is compiling your code/part of your code into a C/C++ library worth it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gx4drk/is_compiling_your_codepart_of_your_code_into_a_cc/)

I'm trying to learn more about obfuscation and I've come across this concept of compiling part of your Java code into a C/C++ library. Have you used it for your app, ever? From a learning point of view and for protecting your app to some degree, is it worth the effort? If you know of samples that are both in Java code and the compiled C/C++ library, please let me know about it. I have the samples that come along with NDK but I read somewhere that they aren't really reliable(or something along those lines). 

This is more about just learning it than obfuscating my app. Any help/advice/experiences appreciated.

Hi. Wondering if its possible to send data to computers via USB with app running? Would like to use this to install companion application on PC and also stream data to it.

Currently I've got two separate steps for the user (user downloads the companion online then opens app to connect to pc companion via websockets).

The story would look like:

1: User installs app on device

2: App asks user to plug into pc to allow download of companion

3: App will transfer data to pc through USB if connected otherwise use websocket
