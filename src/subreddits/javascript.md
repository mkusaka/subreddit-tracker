I have a client that wants to use his app on both his new iPhone and Windows Desktop. Great. But I see React Native's Window package only allows it to work on those which have Window 10 SDK. He says that the program this is for can't really install it so they it has to work from a simple .exe build.

Currently, we are using Quasar v0.15 and are looking toward migrating to Quasar v1... should we stick with Quasar or go another route?

What's the best JavaScript solution towards building a Windows app now a days? (TypeScript is welcome.)

I have this question, mainly out of curiosity, but also for a personal project of mine, so I wanted to ask the JS developers: what is your development framework of choice? And secondly, which elements and qualities do you favour when comparing the frameworks?
