Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

I'm using Windows 10 and VSCode with rust-analyzer plugin from the marketplace. I also made a fresh install of the rust tools via rustup. After opening a rust project, the following message comes up:

rust-analyzer failed to load workspace: Failed to find sysroot for Cargo.toml file c:\\Users\\xyz\\Desktop\\xyz\\Cargo.toml 

The plugin worked before. I uninstalled the stable toolchain once and reinstalled it again. After this it didn't work anymore and reinstalling everything wasn't successfull. How to proceed?

I'm a web dev who usually uses javascript for front/back-end but have been meaning to get better acquainted with a systems language. End goal would be to use it for either services and also to experiment with webassembly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware of the original rust book(which I'm planning on running through as well), however I also recently saw [this book](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-rust) and it got me interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering, what do you guys as experienced Rustaceans think of the above? Is it just fluff or a does it seem like a decent resource?
## [10][Possible ways how to create vector combining other vectors/iterators and new elements](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f6ql1j/possible_ways_how_to_create_vector_combining/)

Hi everyone,

I was wondering what is the best way how to create vector combing other vectors/iterators and other elements. In Javascript you can use array destructuring to achieve this e.g.:

`[1, ...prev_row, 1]`

To achieve the same in rust you can do something like this:

`vec![1].into_iter().chain(prev_row_iter).chain(vec![1].into_iter()).collect()`

The code in this particular example is pretty simple but it can get more complex if you want to combine more vectors and more elements. I was wondering if there is an easier way how to do this.
