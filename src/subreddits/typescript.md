I'm used to working with Python backends; what I'm looking for is something like [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) which uses type annotations to validate requests/response structures among other things. It's very handy. I've done a lot of looking but can't find a TypeScript-first API framework with similar features. Anyone have any recommendations?

Hi everyone,

I need your help with this overriding reusable controller's swagger description using decorators.

Greetings,

i'm trying to extend Array's interface to have a more familiar and safe interface.

I have this module in "Array.ts"

    export{}
    
    declare global 
        {
        interface Array&lt;T&gt;
            {
            resize(size: number, fill?: T): Array&lt;T&gt;;
            at(index: number): T
            size(): number;
            empty(): boolean;
            }
        }
    
    if (!Array.prototype.resize) 
        {
        Array.prototype.resize = function&lt;T&gt;(size: number, fill?: T): T[] 
            {
            if(fill === undefined || size &lt;= this.size())
                { this.length = size; }
            else 
                {
                for(let i = this.size(); i &lt; size; i++)
                    { this[i] = fill; }
                }
            return this;
            }
        }
    
    if(!Array.prototype.at)
        { 
        Array.prototype.at = function&lt;T&gt;(index: number): T
            {
            if(index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= this.size()) { throw "Index out of array bounds exception."; }
            return this[index];
            }
        }
    
    if (!Array.prototype.size) 
        { Array.prototype.size = function(): number { return this.length; } }
    
    if (!Array.prototype.empty)
        { Array.prototype.empty = function(): boolean { return this.size() === 0; } }

And i'm importing it as follows:

    import {} from "./Util/Array.js";

Previously i was using it in a single file and it worked as expected (there was just the resize function).

Then i replaced all my instances of .length with .size() and added the import in all the modified files. The IDE doesn't report any error. However when i try running the project i get errors.

*  On Firefox: `TypeError: this.arr.size is not a function`
* On Edge: `Object doesn't support property or method 'size'`

Is this related to modules being cached rather than loaded twice? Even if that was the case shouldn't the prototype of array have gained the methods on the first time the module was imported?

Any idea on how to solve that?
