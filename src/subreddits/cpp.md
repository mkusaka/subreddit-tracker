Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

We use this tool to find where itâ€™s needed to add forward declaration. It often happens when you changed header file of big project than wait compiling for long time because someone include this file instead using forward declaration. Also the tools helps to reduce include hierarchy

I've taken 3 college courses that's taught C++. But all of what we did was in the IDE and command terminal to do stuff with data. I never did anything to create a GUI for example. What do I need to do now to start doing stuff like that?

I've built my game so far just using SDL2 for rendering and audio - but moved rendering over to Vulkan and now want to upgrade the engine's audio library as well. Can anyone recommend a good audio library?

SDL2 audio is not great for many simultaneous sounds or sounds moving in 2D/3D coordinates - so that is the main feature I am looking to improve. I have read people recommend OpenAL though that library seems like it hasn't been used for many recent games according to their website. I also hear that irrklang is meant to be OK as well. I was also looking into [YSE](http://www.attr-x.net/yse/) but not sure how good it is.

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

Edit: I'm going to try out FMOD since the licencing seems fairly generous for indie developers and I don't plan on releasing multiple games in the same year. Otherwise I probably would go with SoLoud as it has good features and is totally free. Thank you for the help guys!
