Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ijvwsk/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. The platform invokes your code in response to events such as HTTP requests.

Currently, there's no official support for Rust programming language on Lambda.

To run Rust code on Lambda, you will have to build a custom runtime that will run your code.

This guide will help you build for Lambda in a quick and simple way.

It is targeted at developers who have a reasonable understanding of Rust and systems programming, and intend to build serverless function on AWS.

Hello everyone!

As an excuse to learn Rust/WASM interop, I decided to re-create the flying windows screensaver from the 90's. I was really impressed by the level of tooling and support with web interop in the Rust community. I also have an implementation in JavaScript, as a reference to help people understand the Rust a little better (if they come from a JS background).

Code can be found here -&gt; [https://github.com/craftytrickster/flying-windows](https://github.com/craftytrickster/flying-windows)

Demo link found here -&gt; [https://craftytrickster.github.io/flying-windows/](https://craftytrickster.github.io/flying-windows/)
