Here are a few ideas of projects I've been doing to learn Javascript during quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Calculator Pretty straightforward but learned a lot about the syntax of javascript
2. Flashcard Project, You make a bunch of questions/answers. During the day, you can easily pop them out and study. I will actually use this
3. Budget Project, quite simple but I want to make a sleek and nice design for the user. Actually something good to use.

That's what Ive done, would appreciate new ideas if you guys have some :)
