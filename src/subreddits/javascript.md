Hi [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/)! We, the WebStorm team, are excited to announce our first AMA. We‚Äôve never done anything like this before, but we feel the time has come to try something new.

If you‚Äôve never heard of WebStorm, it is a JavaScript IDE by JetBrains. It comes with out-of-the-box support for lots of popular technologies and lets you do most of your development tasks right inside it. More information is available on [our website](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

We‚Äôll start answering your questions at 12 pm UTC on the 24th of August and will be doing this until 5 pm UTC. You can ask us about anything related to WebStorm or the JavaScript support in any other JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, or PyCharm Professional.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers.

Your questions will be answered by:

Guys,

I do not want to start a war of unreasonable arguments. I have a bad feeling right now after being working in a JS project for several weeks. And just want to hear your opinion / suggestions.

This is also a way to vent , so please don't be too hard on me.

1 - My background:

\- I've been working for 5+ years as a software developer. My experience is mainly with Java (Spring and Android) and with Objective-C and Swift on (iOS). All static typed languages (Well, Objective-C is a mixture, but I use it assuming it is statically typed) .

2 - The project:

The project I've been working on is a web console for a product. It is a Single Page Application done with Backbone.js + Marionette. And all the new features have been created using VueJs. It is a well medium to large sized project.

3 - My frustrations:

\- When calling methods with a large quantity of parameters, in Java or Objective-C I usually prefer to create an object that holds all the needed parameters. When refactoring or improving the code, it is easy to see what parameters and types are expected. In this project, It took me a lot to determine the needed parameters as sometimes they are passed as single arguments, and other times are passed within objects. I had to go to the method call to see what parameters were being sent, which leds me to my next frustration

\- IDE does not find method callers: Seems that there is not enough information in the language so the IDE is unable to determine exactly who is calling a method. It does it correctly when the method is called within the same "class", but it seems it is limited to perform a literal method name search in other parts of the project, which leads to wrong results as many times there are methods that have the same name but pertain to different modules. (I am using JetBrains WebStorm). Frustrating!

\- This is probably the worst one: lack of type information, prevents the linter from finding obvious mistakes. I have lost many hours fixing stupid mistakes due to the lack (or loss) of type information for the linter. Calling not existing methods, or performing invalid operations on objects that do not have certain properties is something that statically typed languages will detect right away, and it REALLY speeds me up as a developer. (Languages are for humans, not for the machines)

\- Version incompatibilities: Backbone.js does not use SemVer (yeah, I know!), and apart of that rogue dependency all other dependencies seem to respect SemVer which is good. However there are certain incompatibilities between packages that are not explicitly declared anywhere but in each package documentation (and not always). I know that this  is not a problem inherently existing in JavaScript projects, this also happens in Java or Objective-C, however, I have **over 100  dependencies**. THe project was tied to VERY old versions  with lots of security issues and it took me about 4 days to update every one of them to the latest versions. This was because many of them required major version updates, which obligated me to make changes in the code or in the webpack build parameters. Many of the most time-consuming dependencies were related to WebPack and babel. Don't get me wrong, Babel is a blessing as I no longer have to deal with each single browser compatibility issue, but the burden of having all set up is quite high!

\- Debugging: I am used to debug in the same IDE. Console messages, breakpoints and debug information appear in the very same IDE. Well I spent some hours configuring this so I do not need to use Chrome console. Unfortunately the result was that the "breaking" line in the IDE was not in sync with the actual line that was being executed by the Chrome JavaScript Engine. So I ended up using the Chrome dev tools. Grrrr

My thoughts:

\- Let's be clear: you can create bad code with any language. But JavaScript allows you to create HORRIBLE code. I know that in this project I am working there is a lot of legacy code that is the result of the lack of experience of the first programmers with the language / frameworks, but certain practices are just horrible, and JavaScript allows them.

\- The lack of type information is a burden. I am exploring TypeScript, however there is a lot of code that will never me migrated and need to take a decision about how to tackle that issue.

\- Probably this is happening because the web as a platform has been heavily transformed in the last 15+ years. I mean, that is great. But I feel a like living a little hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading fellow developers!

Now that we‚Äôve had a few months to play around with Deno, what are everyone‚Äôs thoughts? The big thing that‚Äôs brought up often is the lack of npm, but other than that are you happy with it? Is there really even a strong reason to jump from Node to Deno?
