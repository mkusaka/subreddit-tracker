Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fg0p1v/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Welcome once again to the official /r/rust Who's Hiring thread!

Before we begin, job-seekers should also remember to peruse [the prior thread](https://en.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/eyw94s/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

This thread will be periodically stickied to the top of /r/rust for improved visibility. The thread will be refreshed and posted anew when the next version of Rust releases in six weeks.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting (adapted from /r/cpp's jobs thread).

#### Rules for individuals:

* Don't create top-level comments; those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with on-topic questions.
* I will create a stickied top-level comment for individuals looking for work.
* I will create an additional top-level comment for meta discussion.

#### Rules for employers:

* To find individuals seeking work, see the replies to the stickied top-level comment; you will need to click the "more comments" link at the bottom of the top-level comment in order to make these replies visible.
* To make a top-level comment you must be hiring directly; no third-party recruiters.
* One top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* Proofread your comment after posting it and edit it if necessary to correct mistakes.
* Please base your comment on the following template:

COMPANY: *[Company name; please link to your company's website or careers page.]*

TYPE: *[Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]*

DESCRIPTION: *[What does your company do, and what are you using Rust for? How much experience are you seeking and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details the better.]*

LOCATION: *[Where are your office or offices located? If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]*

REMOTE: *[Do you offer the option of working remotely? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]*

I am writing a tool for personal use to organize documents, mark them for revision and implement a spaced repetition algorithm and so on.

I already figured out the features and know pretty well what I want it to look like in the end, so right now I am fiddling around with the implementation.

First of all I am, well not confused, but uncertain about the implementation of a CLI and REPL, since a REPL should implement the exact same CLI logic, namely passing the command and arguments, processing it and output something.

Example CLI (let's say my binary is called my-project)

    $ my-project init
    $ my-project create document ...
    $ my-project memorize document ...

... and so on

A REPL would just be an instance where you would execute "my-document" once and get into a shell, where you can type the exact commands.

    $ my-project
    &gt; init
    &gt; create document ...
    &gt; memorize document ...

Pretty much like python.

The CLI implementation in rust would be pretty straight forward with clap or structopt.

The REPL can be implemented with the help of rustyline.

But I am wondering, since the commands in both cases are literally going to be the same logic, if I can just take the input from rustyline, split along the " " spaces and pass that vector/array to a clap instance, to process the commands? Since that seems to be what rust does with the env arguments, that it gives you.

That way I can keep the logic seperate from the interface, since I might want to write a desktop and web GUI for this project, so I could load the whole thing off to a client/server architecture, kind of like Docker does it and just create another interface via a REST API.

The REST API and client/server architecture are not the main focus right now though, more like something that would be interesting to do later on. But I want to implement the first interfaces, in the terminal, in a manner, that is scale able and is not going to be too much work to port other platforms in the future.
