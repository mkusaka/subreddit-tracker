Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ji8ukt/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hey everyone! 

So I've been wanting to learn Rust for a while now. I think it has so much potential as a future language in various scenarios. And lately I've been realizing that rust is becoming more and more popular (even though it was created 10years ago). Every time I go to hackernews there is a post about a new tool or library built in and for Rust. The problem is, I'm now learning C++, taking Java classes at college (even though I already knew Java) and programming in Python part time. And as much as I want to be a part of one the guys who helped Rust climb to the top (by building libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) I feel like it would be hard to actually learn it. Because I'm using so many languages every day. 

So my questions for you is: 

* Should I stop learning c++ for now and focus on learning Rust and helping the rust community? 
* Can I learn c++ and rust at the same time without mixing information?
* Will I miss anything if I only learn rust in a year or two?

**What is it?**

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (Rust, Java, Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Python,..).

**Motivation**

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.

* github: [https://github.com/jankrepl/mltype](https://github.com/jankrepl/mltype)

PS: I trained the model on the Rust compiler source code. I am not sure how representative of "normal Rust" it is.

## [12][Docs.rs dark color theme - does it have a name?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jn1xmm/docsrs_dark_color_theme_does_it_have_a_name/)

I was wondering if the docs.rs "dark" color theme had a name or is it specific to the website? I started piecing together a base-16 vim theme but wanted to make sure it hadn't already been done.
