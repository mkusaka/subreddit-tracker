Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone!

Let's get right into it. Recent events have lead to a lot of debate and deliberation internally and externally. I'd like to reach out to everyone and open a dialogue between us and the community.

We will not be allowing several posts discussing the subreddit and past events, this is not the proper method to reach us, and I don't want to stifle or drown out the great discussion that happens here with too many posts. Instead, I'd like to open this thread as a place to discuss. In response to past events I would like to state the following will be happening in short order.

 * We will be restructuring our leadership internally as some mods have differing activity levels and some wish to retire. We recognize that we are also severely understaffed which is hurting our ability to serve the community, so we will soon be recruiting additional volunteers from the community to help out. More on this will be announced soon.

 * Any action we take is as a team. At the end of the day we are volunteers doing this in our free time with the best interests of our community in mind. With everything that is going on in the world right now, now is not time for bickering, from anyone. Now is the time for coming together and solving problems. Remember that everyone is a human being. Harassment is zero tolerance.

 * In response to the above point, I would like to ask for everyone's feedback on our current rule set in the comment below. Please keep the discussion calm and collected, or it will be unproductive and removed. I am however encouraging everyone to provide their feedback and suggestions on how we can improve our community.

Expect to see more from me personally as I take a bigger role in trying to help restructure our team and improve our community. 

Have a great day everyone!

I have read a lot of posts where this kind of stuff happened to android developers and always thought it wouldn't happen to me one day.

But it did. I'm now completely banned by Google. Ok my first ban was on Adsense and Admob and I have to say that ban was right. But my second ban on Google Play is just wrong and I guess bad luck. I mistakenly changed my Developer Name to a Name which looks similar to another brand name. I never heard of that brand and that was my mistake. 

Well at least they told me the reason for my ban this time.  As far as I know from other posts normally they don't tell you the reason. Anyways I'm currently trying to get my account back and have taken many steps towards it and had one last Idea how I could get my Account back. 

I mean, I'm ok with having a clean Google Play Store, but damn banning people for changing their name is just so bad. Just disable the account, send an Email about that and give the developer a chance to change their developer name to another. If the users does this a second time then I would be ok with a lifetime ban. This mistake can happen and most of us do this unintentionally. So give them at least 1 chance and if they do it again terminate the account. But not like this google.

There is a lot more behind my story and if you are interested in it and don't want to the same mistakes like I did, you can read the full story here:

Is there a way to find dependency names easily? For example lets say you want to add the BottomNavigationView to your app, which requires:

  
implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.1.0'

Is there a website or resource to go to for finding that? In this example the android docs for the component don't even have the import on there: [https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomnavigation/BottomNavigationView](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomnavigation/BottomNavigationView)

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I google around and hope to find the latest version. Is this the best solution or is there a different way?

hey guys, I'm really new into android dev and I can't find a correct way to pass data from one fragment to another in Bottom Navigation View. Would anyone be so kind and take a look :(? Thanks.

Wanted to check if anything has changed or has been added. I've read SO threads and have googled around and browsed this sub. I know of compiling your code into a C/C++ library, and about Proguard and Dexguard obfuscaion, checking whether the device is an emulator, checking the package name and making the app crash if it doesn't match the original package name, adding server side code check( doesn't apply to my app).


What other things can be done to stop script kiddies and automated tools from pirating your app?

Edit: Don't understand the downvotes here. Has everyone learnt everything and this sub shouldn't exist? Please let me know if there's something you're offended about.

2nd Edit: This was being downvoted heavily when I first created this post. I wasn't fishing for karma (Hint:check my username), but the negative energy gets to you. Sure, don't help me if you're not interested, but please don't downvote a serious question. Thanks to those who answered and helped this be visible.
## [8][[HWTD] How was this done - octopus keymapper](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gxogwj/hwtd_how_was_this_done_octopus_keymapper/)

Does anyone have any idea how this app is able to provide this functionality?

If you haven't seen it before, it maps Bluetooth controllers and keyboards / mice to physical touch events on any app.

There's no way, that I know of, to send touch events to another app, other than accessibility services, but even this is limited to a single pointer and has to enable the service permission first, which octopus does not use.

Octopus app gets the user to select the app they want to provide the touch functionality to first, to load it onto the app. I thought it might be using some kind of launcher feature but it didn't appear to be a launcher either. 

It does have copious amounts of permissions though.

Let’s say the average ecpm for rewarded videos in a country is 5$ but your app has an extreme amount of users in that country, usage is through the roof, the amount of the active users can’t be compared to any other app in that country, how much of a spike of ecpm can you expect comparing to that?

Hi, Im getting into android development and I want to buy a physical device to test my code.

Regarding that there are loads of android phones out there with many sizes, versions and system version (stock android, android one, go) I want like to know your recommendations.

I read about many Pixels ( 4 and 3 with their variations) Moto G7/G8, Nokia phones.
