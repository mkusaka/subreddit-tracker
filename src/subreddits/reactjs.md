I'm just wondering about the difference between a self-closing tag and non self-closing tags in the context of React. I was used to what that meant in html, but there seems to be a bit more to it in React? 

In a tutorial I am following it mentions that because &lt;textarea&gt; is now self closing, we can add value property to it. The tutorial didn't elaborate but gave the impression that if the &lt;textarea&gt; element were not self closing, we would not be able to add the value attribute. Why is that?

I am new to state management in React. I have a query that whenever there is a change in Route location, all the data from Redux state should be cleared. 

Thanks in advance.

I'm struggling to learn react, I'm very new to web development but not coding at all, I come from an iOS and backend background. I've started watching some YouTube videos on react because I can't find any updated courses for 2020 React. I bought the **The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)** but returned it as all the videos where recorded from 2015/16 and at lot of the reviews are saying the course is very outdated. 

I'm just having trouble figuring out the best way to learn react, the concepts seem to foreign to me and I really want to have a strong understanding of React so I can build my business. The fact is YouTube courses that I've watched really don't explain key concept of React they are just teaching how to build whatever they are building.

So does anyone have any advice on how I can overcome this obstacle?

Hey folks

I have a component, and one of it's functions is to get all the documents from a firebase collection, and return only the documents created by the currently logged in user:  [https://codepen.io/mildredthecat/pen/BazKKvy?editors=0010](https://codepen.io/mildredthecat/pen/BazKKvy?editors=0010)

Only problem is that on executing this function, the page doesn't render and I get the following error:

\`\`\` TypeError: Cannot read property 'uid' of null \`\`\`.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon page refesh however, the component renders without problem.

Any ideas why and any suggestions on how I can fix my code? I'm logged in when testing this function, so \`\`\`this.state.userDetails.uid\`\`\` should be assigned a value, but it's evaluating to null. It seems to me like some sort of async issue with setState.

I should mention that I'm also getting a warning saying the following:

\`\`\`Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component\`\`\`

Cheers

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Here's the whole component, for context: [https://codepen.io/mildredthecat/pen/YzWqqoM?editors=0010](https://codepen.io/mildredthecat/pen/YzWqqoM?editors=0010)

After succeeding in uploading blob into MYSQL, I  don't have the opportunity to view the image on my reactJS. Is there anything I can d to display the image?  Please help

    this.onSubmit = this.onSubmit.bind(this);
    this.onFileLoad = this.onFileLoad.bind(this);

  //componentWillReceiveProps is being replaced by componentDidUpdate, as it is providing warning.
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps.errors) {
      this.setState({ errors: nextProps.errors });
    }
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
