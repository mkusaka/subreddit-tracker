    this.cartService.addProduct(this.product == 
      this.db.collection('products', ref =&gt; ref.where('tagid', '==', 
      this.nfc.bytesToHexString(event.tag.id))));

So what I'm trying to do here is add a product to my cart where the tagid of the product is equal to the hexstring of an nfc tag im reading in. 

I have the correct hexstring of the tag saved into my firebase but it's not adding the product to cart when tested in app.

Can supply more code if necessary

interface Name {  
name: string;  
}  
let a!: Name;  
function setup(): void {  
a = { name: "Mike" };  
}  
setup();

console.log(a);

I think this "a + exclamation mark"-Thing (null assertion operator is misleading in my opinion) always as 'lateinit' in the Kotlin sense of meaning  - do you agree?

Typescript has showed me the true path to readable, easy to modify code but I now find myself in a JS heavy environment with no option to switch to TS. It seems every refactor I do opens a slew of `undefined` errors. In general I find the code hard to extend and even reason about, since it's so easy to misread the chain of inputs and outputs between functions.

I think I need to make a habit out of JSDoc comments. I used that for a couple months before the TS switch and now it seems like it's time to go back.

Is this the best vanila JS defense against `undefined` errors and unexpected inputs or do you guys practice anything else?

Hi,

I'm coding some tests to unit tests some services in my NestJS application and I encountered some errors using Partial&lt;T&gt;.

&amp;#x200B;

The error :

`error TS2322: Type 'Partial&lt;User&gt;' is not assignable to type 'User'.`

`Property 'id' is optional in type 'Partial&lt;User&gt;' but required in type 'User'.`

&amp;#x200B;

The interface :

`import { Document, Schema } from 'mongoose'`  
`export enum UserGender {`  
 `FEMALE = "FEMALE",`  
 `MALE = "MALE"`  
`}`

`export interface User extends Document {`  
`id: string;`  
`email: string;`  
`password: string;`  
`firstname: string;`  
`lastname: string;`  
`address: string;`  
`city: string;`  
`zipcode: string;`  
`country: string;`  
`gender: UserGender;`  
`}`

The function causing this error :

`const mockUserDoc: (mock?: {`  
  `id?: string;`  
  `email?: string;`  
  `password?: string;`  
  `firstname?: string;`  
  `lastname?: string;`  
  `address?: string;`  
  `city?: string;`  
  `zipcode?: string;`  
  `country?: string;`  
  `gender?: UserGender;`  
`}) =&gt; Partial&lt;User&gt; = (mock?: {`  
  `id: string;`  
  `email: string;`  
  `password: string;`  
  `firstname: string;`  
  `lastname: string;`  
  `address: string;`  
  `city: string;`  
  `zipcode: string;`  
  `country: string;`  
  `gender: UserGender;`  
`}) =&gt; {`  
 `return {`  
`_id: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.id) || "an id",`  
`email: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.email) || "john.doe@test.com",`  
`password: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.password) || "password",`  
`firstname: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.firstname) || "John",`  
`lastname: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.lastname) || "Doe",`  
`address: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.address) || "address",`  
`city: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.city) || "city",`  
`country: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.country) || "country",`  
`zipcode: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.zipcode) || "zipcode",`  
`gender: (mock &amp;&amp; mock.gender) || UserGender.MALE,`  
  `};`  
`};`

`mockUserDoc()`

I can't see where the error come from, I'm assuming it could come from the enum but still don't know why ...

Hello,

I have two interfaces.  One that looks like this:

    interface Group {
      name: string;
      options: Option[];
    }
    
    interface Option {
      name: string;
      optionGroups: Group[];
    }

and

    interface AnotherGroup {
      name: string;
      options: AnotherOption[];
    }
    
    interface AnotherOption {
      name: string;
      optionGroups: AnotherGroup[];
    }

I then have a react component that expects an item that looks like this

    interface Item {
      options: Group[];
    }

I want to be able to pass an item that has options of type AnotherGroup.

The type definitions basically overlap but, but the type checker complains because they are different interfaces..

Is there a way that I can recursively cast `AnotherGroup[]` to `Group[]`?
