Reconciliation is the process in which React kind of appears to reload data or the whole app on updates.

Let's say I have a back-end server which can only host static files. For SPAs like create-react-app, deploying the front-end to this server is relatively simple (just build the app to the server then route the back-end to the bundled index.html). However, things get complicated when your trying to implement it for multi-page applications. Let's assume again that your back-end server can only have static files, in this case, you can't use SSR. But some pages of the application needs to be fetched from the server at browser runtime. Example, if we have a news website we might have the following component hierarchy:

```
Home
‚îú‚îÄ NewsViewer
‚îî‚îÄ About
```
Home has two components (or pages in this case). About is just a static page. However, NewsViewer is a dynamic page which fetches data from an API to display the appropriate contents. I'm confused how one should use SSG for this kind of scenario since I don't want to statically build each news (just the Viewer itself). So I want my back-end server to only have three HTML files (Home, NewsViewer, and About). Most of the approaches I see about this implements some kind of building all related static files for each News View until a page is fully static. Is it possible to use some kind of SSG with this set-up?

Hey üëã

I have spent many years now building various different React applications, large and small scale, and recently had thoughts on testing I would love to share with you all.

The question I asked myself recently and our team was do we need the full suite of tests to gain confidence with our code? And the answer is probably not, here I go into some details why:

[https://dev.to/boyney123/to-test-or-not-to-test-that-is-the-question-ml3](https://dev.to/boyney123/to-test-or-not-to-test-that-is-the-question-ml3)

Hopefully, it can help some people.

## [9][Conditional rendering of a checkbox's "checked" value based on a json value?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h091zf/conditional_rendering_of_a_checkboxs_checked/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h091zf/conditional_rendering_of_a_checkboxs_checked/
---
Hi all,

I have a materialUI checkbox that I want to either render checked or unchecked based on data I'm pulling in from my Flask API route `/users`.

The data is sent as JSON and I am storing it like so from my API path:

    const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetch("/users").then((response) =&gt;
        response.json().then((data) =&gt; {
        console.log(data);
        setUsers(data.users); //get the data from the API and put it in the state
        })
    );
    }, []);

I am trying to then render into a table.  Here is an example:

    &lt;TableBody&gt;
        {users.map((user) =&gt; (
        &lt;TableRow key={user.user_name}&gt;
            &lt;TableCell component="th" scope="row"&gt;{user.user_name}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
            &lt;TableCell align="left"&gt;{user.first_name} {user.last_name}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
            &lt;TableCell align="left"&gt;{user.email}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
            &lt;TableCell align="center"&gt;  
                
                {user.active}
                
                &lt;Checkbox
                checked={checked}
                color="primary"
                inputProps={{ 'aria-label': 'secondary checkbox' }}
                /&gt;
            &lt;/TableCell&gt;
        &lt;/TableRow&gt;
        ))}
    &lt;/TableBody&gt;

So the above renders a checkbox, in a checked state as I would expect.  It is NOT rendering anything for `{user.active}`. I am not sure how to make it checked or unchecked based on the `user.active` value.  As a note, the `console.log()` is showing `true` as the active property.

In Python I'd do something like 
    
    if user.active == False:
        # checkbox code

I am sorry I am coming from python and finding my way in react/js so apologies if this seems a beginner question.  I've done a heap of searching on this but unfortunately the results of searching is heavily swayed toward making custom checkboxes and I'm not finding what I'm after.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you

I can't tell where the error lies. But when users come to my website a small 100byte manifest.json file sometimes takes over a second to load.

This is all that I have under manifest.json rules for my nginx config:

    location ~* \.(?:manifest|appcache|html?|xml|json)$ {
        expires -1;
    } 

Does anyone have any idea why this might be?
## [11][Methods to create a configureable &amp; downloadable build zip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h07zta/methods_to_create_a_configureable_downloadable/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h07zta/methods_to_create_a_configureable_downloadable/

Hey guys, I'm really new in this area and I actually have no idea where to start.

I want to provide users with the ability to download a zip of a build that uses data, they previously added in a form. Then they can use it how they like, completely Independent of my server.

At first glance I see two ways to go about this:

1.) Actually build on the server, zip the file and download it. I somehow need to trigger the build script and pass the data to the build script. I really have no idea how this would work.

2.) Use a build and just add a file like data.json to the zip, that the app uses to get this data. This seems a little easier and I could do this In what ever language I like, but with this approach I'm not sure how I would handle the usage of the data/the import. Would it be smart to just fetch the file?

Has anybody done something like that? I'm really open for all suggestions.
