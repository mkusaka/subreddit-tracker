I developed a new algorithm, *Dragonbox*, which performs better than Grisu-Exact, still at the same time have all of the followings:\n\n1. Roundtrip guarantee\n2. Shortest length guarantee\n3. Correct rounding guarantee\n\nPlease have a look at the repository if you are interested: [https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox)\n\n(To be fair, I could perhaps apply some of the optimization ideas I got from implementing Dragonbox to Grisu-Exact and save maybe about `1-2ns`, but I nevertheless believe Dragonbox is a better algorithm.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some backgrounds on how I came up with it.\n\nRecently I realized there is a faster algorithm called *Schubfach* ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luHhyQF9zKlM8yJ1nebU0OgVYhfC6CBN/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luHhyQF9zKlM8yJ1nebU0OgVYhfC6CBN/view); a C++ implementation is here: [https://github.com/abolz/Drachennest](https://github.com/abolz/Drachennest)) developed by  Raffaello Giulietti in (maybe around?) 2017-2018. For some reason I don't know about, this algorithm didn't get much attention compared to Ryu, but AFAICT, Schubfach is wonderful. It is really simple, elegant, and fast!\n\nIt was sad but I had to admit that Schubfach is a better algorithm than Grisu-Exact, so I decided to look at it more deeply, and eventually, came up with Dragonbox.\n\nThe beauty of Schubfach is that it does not perform any iterative search for the shortest representation. Rather, it just magically finds the \"optimal number\" at only one trial. But there are two downsides:\n\n1. The output might contain trailing decimal zeros. For example, for the input `1.234f` the output might be something like `123400000 * 10^-8`.\n2. It always computes all of the left endpoint, the center, and the right endpoint of the relevant search interval, which means there are three 128bit x 64bit -&gt; high 64bit multiplications which are expensive. (This is for the case of `double`; for `float`, we instead have 64bit x 32bit -&gt; high 32bit multiplications, but this is still expensive.)\n\nHowever, by applying some Grisu-like method, it is possible to reduce the amortized number of 128bit x 64bit -&gt; high 64bit  multiplications into one, at the cost of having some branches and divisions-by-constants. This is the core idea of Dragonbox.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd about trailing decimal zeros. Like Schubfach, the output of Dragonbox might contain trailing decimal zeros. The implementation provides an option to specify what to do with that: to remove them completely, to report if there might be trailing decimal zeros, or to just don't care about it.\n\nNot removing trailing zeros actually can make sense, because for the string generation procedure, we still need to divide by powers of 10 and compute both the quotient and the remainder. Hence, it might be possible to delay the removal of unnecessary trailing zeros to the string generation procedure and get a better performance. However, I didn't have enough experiment on that and I just removed all trailing zeros for the benchmark.\n\nThanks!", "author_fullname": "t2_4mq5niwb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dragonbox: yet another float-to-string conversion algorithm", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cpp", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ika6ml", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 95, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 95, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1598949090.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.cpp", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m the author of Grisu-Exact (&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/jk-jeon/Grisu-Exact\"&gt;https://github.com/jk-jeon/Grisu-Exact&lt;/a&gt;).

Surprise!\n\nOver the last six months, Library Evolution (and other groups) have been holding regular telecons to continue progress on C++.  Telecons have worked out well for me personally, as I am typically only able to travel to two of the three face-to-face meetings a year.  This has let me contribute more officially during the spring-summer time period, as I wasn't going to be able to attend the Varna meeting that was originally scheduled.  That's not to say that telecons are great for everyone, as time zones, work commitments, preparation time, and general burnout have been issues for many.  Even though there aren't any scheduling conflicts, I have skipped almost all Language Evolution meetings, and most Library meetings.  Core meetings are right out.  Progress on the paper backlog has also been much slower compared to what we get done during face-to-face meetings.\n\nC++20 was finished in Prague (Feb 2020), so all of this work is going towards C++23.\n\n# Executors\n\nAs one of the newly minted LEWG Vice Chairs, I get to participate in paper scheduling decisions.  For C++23, we are following [The Plan](https://wg21.link/p0592).  That means paper scheduling will prioritize:\n\n* [Modularizing the standard library](https://wg21.link/P0581) (`import std;`)\n* [Executors](https://wg21.link/P0443) (a framework for dealing with concurrency and parallelism)\n* [Library support for coroutines](https://wg21.link/P1056) (a way of expressing concurrency)\n* [Networking](https://wg21.link/N4734) (coupled to concurrency and parallelism framework)\n\nThis means that an awful lot of the prioritized features for C++23 rely on making Executors successful.  The executors paper is big by wg21 standards.  60 printed pages, 11 authors, [8 years](https://wg21.link/n3378) of history, and lots of home-grown frameworks playing in the same space.\n\nFor most of the last eight years, executors have been discussed in the concurrency study group.  There is substantial overlap in membership between the concurrency study group and Library Evolution, but the set of concerns of the groups is different.  In order for Library Evolution to effectively review and understand executors, the Library Evolution chair (/u/blelbach) chopped the paper up into smaller pieces and sent those pieces to smaller groups to review and discuss them.  Thread pools goes to one group, the \"property\" mechanism goes to another, and so on until you end up with six groups, meeting for 4-10 weeks.  It's been an enormous amount of effort poured into reviewing the paper, and you can see some of the fruits of those efforts [in](https://wg21.link/P2202) [the](https://wg21.link/p2203) [various](https://wg21.link/p2205) [reports](https://wg21.link/p2207) that are in the [mailing](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/).  The executors authors now have a lot of feedback to incorporate into the next paper revision.\n\n# Freestanding\n\nFreestanding has made some progress in the last six months.\n\n[P2013: Freestanding Language: Optional ::operator new](https://wg21.link/p2013) is a feature test macro decision away from moving to Core.  The bad news here is that many of the smaller study groups aren't meeting right now, so getting feedback on whether a feature test macro is required for this feature may take some time.\n\n[P1641: Freestanding Library: Rewording the Status Quo](https://wg21.link/p1641) and [P1642: Freestanding Library: Easy \\[utilities\\], \\[ranges\\], and \\[iterators\\]](https://wg21.link/p1642r3) were seen and viewed favorably.  Library Evolution doesn't want me to walk through each of the inclusions / exclusions listed in those papers again, which is progress.  Yet again, the feature test macro approach proved somewhat controversial.  [Library Evolution has thus guided me to reorganize these papers](https://wg21.link/p1642/github).  You can see the reorganization in a new revision of [P1642](https://wg21.link/p1642) that folds in the non-feature-test macro parts of P1641.  The feature-test macro parts are in [P2198: Freestanding Feature-Test Macros and Implementation-Defined Extensions](https://wg21.link/P2198).\n\n# Feature-test macros\n\nWhen I started doing freestanding work in 2017 with [P0829](https://wg21.link/p0829), feature test macros were just something in a standing document, and weren't in the standard.  Now in 2020, I'm pretty sure that freestanding papers have consumed more than half of all the feature-test macro study group's time.  With regards to freestanding, the feature test macros are in a bit of a mess.  I feel that, in 2030, it will be nice having all the feature test macro stuff worked out, but in 2020, it certainly is painful.\n\nHere's an optimistic answer to a reasonable question that should be answerable with feature test macros.\n\n*Is the non-parallel version of uninitialized\\_default\\_construct available?*\n\n    #if defined(__cpp_lib_raw_memory_algorithms) &amp;&amp; __cpp_lib_raw_memory_algorithms &gt;= 201606L\n    // hosted success path and freestanding extension path\n    #elif defined(__cpp_lib_freestanding_memory) &amp;&amp; __cpp_lib_freestanding_memory &gt;= 202007L\n    // freestanding path\n    #else\n    // fallback path\n    #endif\n\nI say this is optimistic, because it is also assuming that `&lt;version&gt;` is available.  For pre-C++20 compilers, that isn't a guarantee either, and that detection code isn't trivial either.\n\nThere are much sadder questions that can be asked in freestanding contexts though...\n\n*Is thread available?*\n\n`// No good answers here. Currently calling this out of scope.`\n\nGetting feature testing right is surprisingly tricky and error prone, especially since the whole point of the feature is to be usable in codebases that need to work on old toolchains.  A time machine would be really handy here.\n\n# What's next for freestanding?\n\nThe most important aspect of standard C++ affecting freestanding is the lack of suitable error handling. This is also the area that is the most difficult to gain any kind of consensus.  Keep an eye out for a paper in the next few months that looks to discuss the many trade-offs in the various standard and standard-track error handling approaches.\n\nOther than that, there are a lot of papers that need to be written to cover the aspects of [P0829](https://wg21.link/P0829) that haven't been covered in [P1642](https://wg21.link/P1642).  There are questions in these future papers that need to be resolved by Library Evolution, like \"are we willing to split overload sets that look like `std::abs`\", \"are we willing to have partial class support for classes like `std::array`\", and \"are we willing to require more C support for freestanding C++ than C requires from freestanding C\".  These should be straightforward papers, but they would all be competing with a very clogged back log of LEWG papers.\n\nLanguage Evolution isn't quite as pressed for time, so now would be a good time to get some freestanding features in here.  I have new ideas on how to tackle issues involving `thread_local`, as well as constructors and destructors called during startup and termination, but those ideas would need some implementation experience that I haven't found the time for.\n\nThe area that most needs attention (that I don't have time to provide) is compile time programming for freestanding environments.  `std::vector` is a poor candidate for runtime kernel and embedded programming, but it *should* be just fine for compile-time kernel and embedded programming.  What we need is for someone to see what happens when you take all the non-freestanding `constexpr`'s in the standard library, and make them `consteval`.  Do bad things happen?  Do we end up splitting overload sets in nasty ways?  Does the change in object destruction timing frequently cause bugs?  I don't know, and would only really know the answer to these questions with some implementation and usage experience.\n\nOn top of all that, the Microsoft STL implementation now has much of the test infrastructure open sourced as well.  I need to get around to contributing a kernel test harness that can exercise freestanding C++ in the Windows kernel.

That means paper scheduling will prioritize:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P0581\"&gt;Modularizing the standard library&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;import std;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P0443\"&gt;Executors&lt;/a&gt; (a framework for dealing with concurrency and parallelism)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P1056\"&gt;Library support for coroutines&lt;/a&gt; (a way of expressing concurrency)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/N4734\"&gt;Networking&lt;/a&gt; (coupled to concurrency and parallelism framework)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that an awful lot of the prioritized features for C++23 rely on making Executors successful.  The executors paper is big by wg21 standards.  60 printed pages, 11 authors, &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/n3378\"&gt;8 years&lt;/a&gt; of history, and lots of home-grown frameworks playing in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For most of the last eight years, executors have been discussed in the concurrency study group.  There is substantial overlap in membership between the concurrency study group and Library Evolution, but the set of concerns of the groups is different.  In order for Library Evolution to effectively review and understand executors, the Library Evolution chair (&lt;a href=\"/u/blelbach\"&gt;/u/blelbach&lt;/a&gt;) chopped the paper up into smaller pieces and sent those pieces to smaller groups to review and discuss them.  Thread pools goes to one group, the &amp;quot;property&amp;quot; mechanism goes to another, and so on until you end up with six groups, meeting for 4-10 weeks.  It&amp;#39;s been an enormous amount of effort poured into reviewing the paper, and you can see some of the fruits of those efforts &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P2202\"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p2203\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p2205\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p2207\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that are in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/\"&gt;mailing&lt;/a&gt;.  The executors authors now have a lot of feedback to incorporate into the next paper revision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Freestanding&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freestanding has made some progress in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p2013\"&gt;P2013: Freestanding Language: Optional ::operator new&lt;/a&gt; is a feature test macro decision away from moving to Core.  The bad news here is that many of the smaller study groups aren&amp;#39;t meeting right now, so getting feedback on whether a feature test macro is required for this feature may take some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p1641\"&gt;P1641: Freestanding Library: Rewording the Status Quo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p1642r3\"&gt;P1642: Freestanding Library: Easy [utilities], [ranges], and [iterators]&lt;/a&gt; were seen and viewed favorably.  Library Evolution doesn&amp;#39;t want me to walk through each of the inclusions / exclusions listed in those papers again, which is progress.  Yet again, the feature test macro approach proved somewhat controversial.  &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p1642/github\"&gt;Library Evolution has thus guided me to reorganize these papers&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see the reorganization in a new revision of &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p1642\"&gt;P1642&lt;/a&gt; that folds in the non-feature-test macro parts of P1641.  The feature-test macro parts are in &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P2198\"&gt;P2198: Freestanding Feature-Test Macros and Implementation-Defined Extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Feature-test macros&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I started doing freestanding work in 2017 with &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/p0829\"&gt;P0829&lt;/a&gt;, feature test macros were just something in a standing document, and weren&amp;#39;t in the standard.  Now in 2020, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that freestanding papers have consumed more than half of all the feature-test macro study group&amp;#39;s time.  With regards to freestanding, the feature test macros are in a bit of a mess.  I feel that, in 2030, it will be nice having all the feature test macro stuff worked out, but in 2020, it certainly is painful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an optimistic answer to a reasonable question that should be answerable with feature test macros.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the non-parallel version of uninitialized_default_construct available?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#if defined(__cpp_lib_raw_memory_algorithms) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; __cpp_lib_raw_memory_algorithms &amp;gt;= 201606L\n// hosted success path and freestanding extension path\n#elif defined(__cpp_lib_freestanding_memory) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; __cpp_lib_freestanding_memory &amp;gt;= 202007L\n// freestanding path\n#else\n// fallback path\n#endif\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say this is optimistic, because it is also assuming that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is available.  For pre-C++20 compilers, that isn&amp;#39;t a guarantee either, and that detection code isn&amp;#39;t trivial either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are much sadder questions that can be asked in freestanding contexts though...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is thread available?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// No good answers here. Currently calling this out of scope.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting feature testing right is surprisingly tricky and error prone, especially since the whole point of the feature is to be usable in codebases that need to work on old toolchains.  A time machine would be really handy here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#39;s next for freestanding?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect of standard C++ affecting freestanding is the lack of suitable error handling. This is also the area that is the most difficult to gain any kind of consensus.  Keep an eye out for a paper in the next few months that looks to discuss the many trade-offs in the various standard and standard-track error handling approaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, there are a lot of papers that need to be written to cover the aspects of &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P0829\"&gt;P0829&lt;/a&gt; that haven&amp;#39;t been covered in &lt;a href=\"https://wg21.link/P1642\"&gt;P1642&lt;/a&gt;.  There are questions in these future papers that need to be resolved by Library Evolution, like &amp;quot;are we willing to split overload sets that look like &lt;code&gt;std::abs&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;are we willing to have partial class support for classes like &lt;code&gt;std::array&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;are we willing to require more C support for freestanding C++ than C requires from freestanding C&amp;quot;.  These should be straightforward papers, but they would all be competing with a very clogged back log of LEWG papers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Language Evolution isn&amp;#39;t quite as pressed for time, so now would be a good time to get some freestanding features in here.  I have new ideas on how to tackle issues involving &lt;code&gt;thread_local&lt;/code&gt;, as well as constructors and destructors called during startup and termination, but those ideas would need some implementation experience that I haven&amp;#39;t found the time for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The area that most needs attention (that I don&amp;#39;t have time to provide) is compile time programming for freestanding environments.  &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; is a poor candidate for runtime kernel and embedded programming, but it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be just fine for compile-time kernel and embedded programming.  What we need is for someone to see what happens when you take all the non-freestanding &lt;code&gt;constexpr&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s in the standard library, and make them &lt;code&gt;consteval&lt;/code&gt;.  Do bad things happen?  Do we end up splitting overload sets in nasty ways?  Does the change in object destruction timing frequently cause bugs?  I don&amp;#39;t know, and would only really know the answer to these questions with some implementation and usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, the Microsoft STL implementation now has much of the test infrastructure open sourced as well.  I need to get around to contributing a kernel test harness that can exercise freestanding C++ in the Windows kernel.  So much to do, and so little time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "freestanding|LEWG Vice Chair", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi27", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ik40qx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ben_craig", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/cpp/comments/ik40qx/freestanding_in_my_home_office/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ik40qx/freestanding_in_my_home_office/", "subreddit_subscribers": 152210, "created_utc": 1598899878.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "cpp", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_xcs4wae", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "EnTT v3.5.0 is out: Gaming meets Modern C++", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cpp", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ik7tl2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "gamedev", "selftext": "# What's EnTT\n\n[`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) is a header-only library written in **modern C++**.\n\nIt's mainly known for its [entity-component-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) model.
