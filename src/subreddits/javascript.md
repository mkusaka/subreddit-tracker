I've been working with Javascript full time for about 3 years now. I maintain an internal application for a small company. I try to spend a fair amount of time reading about Javascript and keeping up with the latest stuff, and I feel like class-based code still dominates so many discussions. So many threads about people trying to keep up with different contexts of `this`.

In something like 100k lines of code I don't think I've ever felt the need to create a class, or even make reference to `this` at any point.

Am I really missing out on anything by avoiding classes and this? I'm very comfortable with this pattern, I just mostly want to probe the community to understand whether it's a something I should look to adopt, or whether it really is just a matter of personal preference of programming patterns.

For reference the stack I work with is Typescript/Node/Express/GraphQL/React. I often see Typescript used as an example of preferring the class based approach, but I still haven't encountered a scenario where I felt limited to that where I couldn't either infer a type automatically, or supplement with an interface when needed.

Appreciate any discussion at all on the matter. Cheers!

Edit: Thanks for all the great responses everyone.  I've read 'em all (so far).
