## [8][[AskJS] Is there any IDE that lets you structure your code and edit one piece at a time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/futjjb/askjs_is_there_any_ide_that_lets_you_structure/)

This is my biggest problem with all the IDEs I have tried. Any time I approach the 100 line mark, I suddenly get annoyed by scrolling. Because I put my global starting initializations and objects and classes at the top where they belong, but my actual main loop is at the bottom. 


So what if there was a way for me to select the top area and make it designateed for classes initialization, then another one for objects, then another for global values, then another for loading the savegame, then another for actual logic. All would be in the same file, but you could "extract" the part you want ,and you could look only at it and have it focused.. without the interrruptions from the rest of the code... if it got too long, or less relevant, you could just branch off another sub-category. That would be great. 


Like arbitrary chapters or groups that you could click and jump to like in Word.



But like this.. I have no way to make little chunks of code without corrupting them into separate require module and convoluting the whole logic and whatnot.


Only way to achieve what I want is to load 75 different .js files in the html header and having to deal with naming so they are in order always if I add something, and then when everything is done, just copy them and assemble one file. That's a lot of work... but I think something like this is the only way for me to not get overwhelmed and sidetracked by ("wtf is this shit" - actual code that works) while scrolling down.


How can you guys handle one giant file... or a billion small ones where anyone trying to read the code is at a major disadvantage?
