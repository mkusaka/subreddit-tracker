**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

Suppose a module `M` has an exported method `foo` whose implementation uses class `myclass` and/or method `mymethod` that originiate in an unrelated module or header and the module doesn't export them . Also implemetation of this method `foo` is exported in the module `M`.

Can one import the module and use the function `foo` from another library doesn't import of either `myclass` or `mymethod`? Technically, one can use implementation that supplied by the module so it can work.

Why the question? Suppose I have a simple function `foo` that can be inlined (fully or not fully as it might call some other heavy methods but it will at least save unnecessary function call). However, to compile and inline it one needs to import an additional header or module and I want to minimize header-level dependencies.

So the question is in short, is it possible to use exported method whose implementation is also exported - yet my current module is unable to compile it due to dependencies issue? Or the implementation must not be exported in this case?

Edit: from the replies it is understood the classification of "visible" and "reachable" methods/classes essentialy solve the issue. However, now I have another question: When ODR violation happens? When visible objects have identical names or even when reachable objects have the same name?

In similar note, consider diamond problem in modules. `struct X` is used by `module A` and `module B` yet none of them export it. Can module `B` use struct `X` generated by `A`? If yes, then suppose struct `X` is defined differently in `A` and `B` will it result in UB or a sensible compiler/linker error?

Hi, I was curious if there is already around a modern library for approximate string matching in c++

The use case would be catching potential typos in string input parameters and providing the user with an error message with the closest matching suggestion coming from a list of already existing strings.

(if not we might try to roll our own.

Thanks!
