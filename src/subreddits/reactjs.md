We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi /r/reactjs! We are super excited to share with you our new open-source React dev tool, Reactime (v4.0). Reactime is a Chrome DevTools extension for performing time-travel state debugging of React applications. Previous versions of Reactime required an npm package to be added to your React applications, but the newest version can pull state from any application, as long as React DevTools is installed in your Chrome browser.

Please check it out on the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reactime/cgibknllccemdnfhfpmjhffpjfeidjga?hl=en-US) and [our website](https://reactime.io/).

If you want to learn more about how Reactime v4.0 was made, check out [this article](https://medium.com/@aquinojardim/react-fiber-reactime-4-0-f200f02e7fa8) by one of our team members. You can also watch a short demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7qP2a9KEnk).

I have a react app and I want to make extensions for it and let other users also create extensions.

The problem is with loading the extension. I was thinking of fetching the url (index.html) and displaying it with dangerouslySetInnerHTML. And let the extension communicate via a shared store(not sure about this part but can find out) 

There is probably someone who had a similar problem and point me in a better direction than dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

## [9][How to retrieve authorized info from Fantasy Premier League Using React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hsvnoz/how_to_retrieve_authorized_info_from_fantasy/)

I was hoping that someone could help me out here.

I am creating a small Fantasy Football Premier League app using React. There is user specific information that needs authentication before requesting information from the Fantasy Premier League API.

The idea is for the app to start with a login page, where the user inputs their username and password. The app will then post this information to the login URL and return a token, that can be used to retrieve information that requires authentication.

previously, I created the app in python which worked, below was the code:  


     login':USERNAME, 'password':PASSWORD, 'redirect_uri': 'https://fantasy.premierleague.com/', 'app':'plfpl-web' } s = requests.session() s.post("https://users.premierleague.com/accounts/login/", data=payload) myData = s.get('https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/me').json(); 

 How I know this worked is that when authorized, the variable myData can successfully access 'https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/me' and gets assigned to all of my authorized information. When my details are incorrect (not authorized), the myData variable is "null" (the values of the keys are of nullType). Using this method, I can request all Authorized information off of the 's' variable.

Now when converting the code to React, I am struggling to successfully Authenticate. I print out the response from a GET call to the "https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/me" API url and I get the NULL values like I was talking about above. My username and password is correct.

Below is the current code.

  
 

    formData:any = {
        'login': USERNAME, 
        'password': PASSWORD, 
        'app': 'plfpl-web',     
        'redirect_uri': 'https://fantasy.premierleague.com/' };
    
    login = async (username:string = this.formData.login,password:string = this.formData.password) =&gt; { return axios
        .post("https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://users.premierleague.com/accounts/login/", this.formData)
        .then((response)=&gt; { 
        axios.get("https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/me")
            .then(result =&gt; {         
                console.log(result); 
            }); 
        }); 

 

Please could someone help me out with the following:

1. What am I doing wrong and how do I successfully login to FPL via react?
2. Once I successfully achieve authentication, I have heard that I may need to retrieve a token number to use in my succeeding calls. How would I do this?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Hi does anyone know of an elegant solution to have multiple themes across a react app, for example if at the top level I change the app to theme 2 how can I update my button.css component file if I am styling at the component level.

Thanks!
