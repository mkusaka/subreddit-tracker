We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Link -  [https://ivan-ivanov-beta-portfolio.netlify.app/](https://ivan-ivanov-beta-portfolio.netlify.app/) 

&amp;#x200B;

I made my first portfolio website. I am a uni student (accounting) but my recent internship inspired me to go into programming. 

The website does not contain any complicated functionality. I am looking for any feedback that you have. (even if you want to criticise the way I have written stuff). 

Thanks,

Ivan

I have been learning JS, HTML, CSS and React for about a year now. I have a degree in computer science and mathematics (2:1 in 2001!).

I have spent 20 years working as an actuary and left last year in September. Because I have a computer science degree I didnâ€™t feel like getting another was needed so I set about learning for myself. I have also learned Python and brushed up my sql. I love react though. Itâ€™s fun for me.

I would like to start applying for some jobs (I am based in London). 

So my question is please:
How would I write my CV and what would you like to see on there as a recruiter/hiring manager to get me into a job?

Am I missing anything?

TL;DR; mid-life crisis career changer with computer science degree from 2001 and a year of self learning would love advice for getting a job in react in London.

I have found a lot of testing solutions, like Jest, TestRail, Cypress etc. Are they supposed to be used in combo, or you should just use one of them? What is the "standard" way of implementing your test stack.

I am completely new to software testing, so thanks in advance for your patience.

I have a SaaS application that Iâ€™ve been working on, mainly building out the backend but it has a complete front end. However as Iâ€™m about to go live it looks pretty unpolished and not very mobile friendly. The major UI frameworks like Bootstrap and Material are very heavy and opinionated that would involve a lot of rework. Iâ€™m hoping to find a framework that I can just layer on top of what I have. Swap out my buttons for their buttons, use their responsive nav, etc. with minimal rework on my side. Do any good frameworks fit that bill?

Hi there

I am rendering a large amount of data for a visualization where it is interactive with scroll (imagine tens to hundreds of thousands of points). Currently it's plain canvas but I thought ReactART would be a cool option. The ability for it to render to SVG or canvas is really nice because we need SVG export for our app anyways, and we basically have two renderers for many different parts of the app, one canvas, one SVG

&amp;#x200B;

I setup ReactART but unfortunately its a fair bit slower than native canvas

Here is a small speedtest sandbox that shows performance goes pretty slow after 1000-10000 elements even with canvas mode of react-art

React ART [https://codesandbox.io/s/happy-smoke-we7bl?file=/src/App.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/happy-smoke-we7bl?file=/src/App.js)

canvas [https://codesandbox.io/s/nice-bose-xwd9j?file=/src/App.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/nice-bose-xwd9j?file=/src/App.js)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know I was kinda dreaming big to think this would be performant. Are there any tricks I should look into. What next steps would you consider...abandon react-art and go back to maintaining two renderers? Different library? 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't invested a lot in react-art here, I just thought it was cool, so anything is on the table. I am wondering if even something like react-three-fiber would run into these isssues because it seems to really come down to having this much component data rather than the canvas for example in this react art case, and I do want the app to try to keep things going even with really large datasets

Hi, I'm using react functional component and react-tabtab. All react tabs (any library) re-render it's panel when switching between tabs. How to prevent this? 

For eg. I have 2tabs - Tab0, Tab1 (Tab0 active as default)
User fills in a form in Tab0 but does not submit/save and switch to Tab1 and then return back to Tab0 (I need to preserve these user inputs - component states)

Hey all, I finally made a personal profile website and looking for feedback from the user perspective. Wondering how I could make it better, particularly from a recruiter's perspective since I made this for my resume. Let me know what you think!
