Due to the requests for SQLite support (from here too), I worked hard the last days to release the first limited support for SQLite Database. The project is built on top of Electron (TS), If someone wants to help me I will grateful.

Hey y'all

If anyone could help me I'd really appreciate it - I've been trying to learn some Ruby and I've been using Codecademy's 'Learn Ruby' course. It's been going okay I guess, but I'm completely lost on iterating over a hash. I get what a hash is, and it's not making new hashes that fucks me up, it's trying to do anything with the damn thing. 

Here's a thing (I'm a n00b, can you tell?) of code straight from the lesson. I don't think the last line is right, but it looks the same as the hint given on the page??? Everything under the frequencies = [Hash.new](https://Hash.new) line is gibberish and I had to have it solved for me. I've tried googling my question but I'm coming up blank. This code is supposed to take an input from the user and arrange the words by frequency. I really don't understand the | lines or the placeholder thing or well... anything! I'm so lost and I feel like giving up. Halp???

rb:

puts "Enter a phrase you'd like to analyze: "  
text = gets.chomp  
words = text.split  
frequencies = Hash.new(0)  
words.each { |word| frequencies\[word\] += 1 }  
frequencies = frequencies.sort\_by do |word, count|  
 count  
end  
frequencies.reverse!  
frequencies.each do | word, frequency|  
 puts word + " " + frequency.to\_s  
end
