Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

I'm looking to create something similar to Doordash's [floating widget](https://youtu.be/qERuJqtU8cE?t=40), but can't seem to find any tutorials on this type of widget specifically.

Spot on? A step in the right direction? Anything you miss? Anything you can't find? I'm curious to hear what r/androiddev think of it :)

Learn how to use floating windows in your Android apps. The first lesson teaches you how to build the main app using Jetpack Compose and Room.

Have you ever wondered how to make those floating windows used by Facebook Heads and other apps? Have you ever wanted to use the same technology in your app? Itâ€™s easy, and I will guide you through the whole process.

Author of this article is a developer of [Floating Apps](https://floatingapps.net/); the first app of its kind on Google Play and the most popular one with over 8 million downloads. After 6 years of the development of the app, I know a bit about it. Itâ€™s sometimes tricky, and I spent months reading documentation and Android source code and experimenting. I received feedback from tens of thousands of users and see various issues on different phones with different Android versions.

Hereâ€™s what I learned along the way.

**In this article, I teach you how to build the simple main app with Jetpack Compose and Room.**

## [10][New Google Play Console User Review Notifications are gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j3njuk/new_google_play_console_user_review_notifications/)

In the older Google Play Console, we had an option to get notifications in the console when a user left a certain star review for any of our apps. In the new console, that option is gone and has been replaced by email notifications.

This here is the problem:

I have 50+ apps, and these emails start to become spammy and can make you miss other important emails. Is there a way to get the notifications direct in the console?

Hello. I released my app and after couple months got a mail that it is violating "Site Behavior: Navigation" Policy. I have updated my app ten times and request for rereview but I am keep on getting same violation. This is cause of any librares in app code?
