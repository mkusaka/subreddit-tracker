We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [6][[Typescript] React/Redux/Ajax/SQL = Where to put models?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hapi9m/typescript_reactreduxajaxsql_where_to_put_models/)

Hi all,

I have a PWA project based on React + Redux + Axios / SQL

I want to ask how / where you put your models from Services/Redux/SQL, models are shared 

* request model for service
* response model from service
   * response model can be used for SQL 
   * response model can be used for Redux 

&amp;#x200B;

for generic models, should I create folder &lt;rootDir&gt;/models? or what are you using?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

Here's my repo: [https://github.com/DanielJWagener/calculator-react](https://github.com/DanielJWagener/calculator-react)  


When I deployed my app to Github Pages, I set `"homepage"` in my [package.json](https://github.com/DanielJWagener/calculator-react/blob/master/package.json) to `"`[`http://DanielJWagener.github.io/calculator-react`](http://DanielJWagener.github.io/calculator-react)`"`. The deployment went fine and the hosted app looks okay, but now when I run `yarn start` on my machine, it runs on localhost:3000/calculator-react (instead of just localhost:3000) and the background image in my [Display component](https://github.com/DanielJWagener/calculator-react/blob/master/src/components/Display/display.styles.js) doesn't render. The issue resolves itself if I change `"homepage"`  to  `"`[`http://DanielJWagener.github.io`](http://DanielJWagener.github.io/calculator-react)`/"`. Is there a way to avoid having to change that URL before and after deployments? Or is it just an annoying little thing I have to remember to do?
## [9][Help with socket io and redux saga bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/haq60f/help_with_socket_io_and_redux_saga_bug/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/haq60f/help_with_socket_io_and_redux_saga_bug/
---
Hi all, i figured i would make a post here before I submit an issue to the package. I have an event channel that I'm using to listen for incoming socket events and dispatch actions.  

```
const createSocketChannel = (socket) =&gt;
  eventChannel((emit) =&gt; {
    socket.on("message", (payload) =&gt; emit(() =&gt; messageReceived(payload)));

    socket.on("client-disconnected", (payload) =&gt; emit(() =&gt; clientDisconnected(payload);

    return () =&gt; {};
  });
```

What's strange is the in the first event, this is working perfectly. In the second event, if I replace the dispatch action with a console.log of the payload, it will log the payload every time. The emit function is the only thing that is not called.

...Any one have any idea? Is there something I'm doing wrong or some other code that could help identity what this problem is?

Hi r/reactjs!! I'm currently taking a course in graphic design and have built a web app using ReactJS that is a twist on generative art. Typically, the generative artist hands the process over to a machine, in Exquisite Consequences, Im going to hand the work over to you and crowd source the elements. I would love it, if you took 30 seconds of your time and contributed to my work here:

    import React from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    
    class App extends React.Component {
      constructor(){
        super();
    
        this.state = {
          time: new Date(),
        }
      }
    
    currentTime(){
      this.setState({
        time: new Date(),
    
      })
    }
    
      componentWillMount(){
       setInterval(()=&gt; this.currentTime(),1000)
      }
    
      render(){
      return (
        &lt;div className="App"&gt;
    
         {this.state.time.toLocaleTimeString()}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );}
    }
    
    export default App;
    

here in the setState line,

when i use equals sign, it doesnt update every second

     this.setState=({
        time: new Date(),
    
      })

like this, is there any reason for that?
