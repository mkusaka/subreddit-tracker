I have been learning MERN for a little more than a month and would really appreciate it if anyone could give some helpful feedback to improve.
## [6][React Router protect routes with a specific way](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i74t69/react_router_protect_routes_with_a_specific_way/)

Hello. I am building a web app and I need to have protected routes. I want to do it in a specific way though. First, a jwt is stored in client's cookies. Then, every time a route matches, I want first to make a call to my server, to validate the jwt, and then, if successfully verified, I want the screen to load, otherwise i want the login screen to pop. I am currently facing problems doing this, mainly because the login screen renders before the api request is made, and then the screen does not get updated. Any help?

Course is really good and I finished one week. But then I saw a guy commenting about this and then checked. I found latest version is 16 so version 1 will be really outdated. Should I still do it or find another course? If it will be easy for me to transition from learning everything in version 1 to 16 then I might do it but I newbie in this and I don't know shit about it. Pls help

---
Some sources say localstorage but then people say it's prone to XSS attacks so then they say HTTP ONLY Cookie but say not to do that either. What is the safest way to store these tokens? Would it be a good idea to get a new token after each request and store it in memory within the component file?
