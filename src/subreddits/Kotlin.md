## [1][Snakecase Long Type varibales value?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/esqod6/snakecase_long_type_varibales_value/)

I wanted to know if there's any difference of if it's better to use one type of casing, as I've seen Long variable values written normally and snakecased, such as

val regularLong: Long = 1000000L -&gt; Regular declaration

var snakeCasedLong: Long = 1\_000\_000L -&gt; Snakecased declaration

Is there any real difference? Also, if anybody knows where to learn the best practices for Kotlin, I would appreciate if you shared it. Thanks!

On Flutter sites, they are talking like it's just a matter of time before Flutter kills Kotlin.   I know nothing about Dart, but I have been playing around with Kotlin and I love it.  So I'm hoping that Kotlin stays viable.  What does this sub think of the flutter movement?
