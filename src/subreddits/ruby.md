Rails 6 supports multiple primary databases, replicas and sharding (coming in 6.1), and this is great. However, I'm wondering if there's any way to connect to independent databases at runtime, in a way that is not defined a priori in the database.yml, but instead defined by the application.

Take for example a "bring your own database" cloud service, where the "host" db of the app contains account information and other metadata, but all customer specific data is stored elsewhere on a database server controlled by the customer.

The logic can be implemented at the app level, or perhaps a thin HTTP API can be installed on the remote db server, but would there be a way to have the client run just a standard Postgres database, give auth to the app, and have the benefits of Activerecord while communicating with the remote db?

I built a tool to visualise streaming data in the terminal. You can plot any command that can be piped into stdin. Its super handy for quickly visualising trends in the terminal.

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/Martin-Nyaga/termplot)!
