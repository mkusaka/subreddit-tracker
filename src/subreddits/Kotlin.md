So I'm trying to build a map from 3 different lists and I am using this code here:

    map = categories!!.groupBy { it.id }.mapValues {
        map-&gt; list1!!.filter {
            a -&gt;list2!!.any { b -&gt; a.id == b.id } &amp;&amp; a.category_id == map.key
    }}.toMutableMap()

So it goes like this:

* list1 contains object1 which has the category id and an id
* list2 contains object2 which has only the id and not the category id
* The keys needs to be the category ids
* The values are the elements of list1 that have the same ids of the elements of list2
* Multiple elements can be in one category
* The end result is like this: Map&lt;Long, List&lt;object1&gt;&gt;

There is quite a lot of data to go through and right now it takes somewhere between 30sec to 1min on my phone to execute (in a coroutine).

    fun getDeviceToken() : String {
        FirebaseInstanceId.getInstance().instanceId.addOnCompleteListener{
            return if (it.isSuccessful) it.result?.token else "" //return is not allowed here
        }
    }

I'm getting the error "return is not allowed here", so how do I return a value from a listener?
