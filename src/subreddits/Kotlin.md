For business logic, I am definitely looking at Kotlin Multiplatform. But I'm not sure of the UI part.   
React Native vs Flutter - I'm not sure which of them works best with Multiplatform. And I'm not conversant with either of them.

It is very important that I have to write as less code as possible to release the apps on both the platforms and maintain them for a long time.

Can somebody help in making me decide?

`class User(var firstName:String, var lastName:String ){`

  
 `companion object {`  
 `fun createUser(firstName: String, lastName: String):User {`  
 `return User(firstName,lastName)`  
`}`  
`}`  
 `fun printFullName(): String{`  
 `return ("$firstName - $lastName")`  
`}`  


`override fun toString(): String {`  
 `return printFullName()`  
`}`

`}`

when i create an object and call the   
`val user = createUser("Jon", "Doe")`

It logs  "Jon-Doe" when i do not over ride toString() but when i do not over ride it 

logs " User@24136"   


Can anyone explain why we over ride the toString and how this code is working. I have just started with kotlin and this will be first time im getting into oops.

I'm working on a math library and I'm wondering if anyone can explain why the stdlib has two different ways to do that same thing: both absolute value and sign are implemented as a function AND as an extension property.

Does it matter which one I use?

Hello. I am making an application that connects to Punk API and I have a small problem. I don't know how to download the ingredients list into my Recycler View. I put a link to the application where my attempts are. I was able to successfully download everything except ingredients and MashTemp. Thank you for any tips.

## [8][KVision 3.9.0 is released (with support for React components)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/glmzy8/kvision_390_is_released_with_support_for_react/)

[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source web framework created for Kotlin/JS. It allows developers to build modern web applications with the Kotlin language.

I have released KVision 3.9.0, with extremely useful support for embedding React components in KVision applications. Now you can use not only the rich set of built-in KVision components, but also literally any free React component available in the NPM repository. Full integration with KVision DSL and built-in state management makes using external React components even easier then with [kotlin-react](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers)!

You can look at the [new chapter of the guide](https://kvision.gitbook.io/kvision-guide/part-2-advanced-features/using-react-components) to get started right now.

For more details about this release see the [changelog](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision/releases/tag/3.9.0).

As always any feedback is welcomed :-)
## [9][String.split(Pattern) is not symmetrical with Pattern.split(String) for even-length strings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gls1ko/stringsplitpattern_is_not_symmetrical_with/)

**Note: If you're using old Reddit, see Wolfsdale's reply below. I'm new to Reddit and using new Reddit in Markdown mode.**

I was working on a simple exercise to split a string up into pairs of characters when I noticed something surprising with the behavior of `String.split(Pattern)`: it gives a different result from `Pattern.split(String)` when the string has an even number of characters. Here's the JUnit 5 test code that shows the problem:
```
private val expr = "(?&lt;=\\G.{2})" // group into pairs of characters
private val regex: Regex = expr.toRegex()
private val pattern: Pattern = expr.toPattern()

@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(strings = ["a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "abcdef"])
fun `split should be symmetrical`(s: String) {
    assertAll(
        { assertEquals(regex.split(s).size, s.split(regex).size,
                "regex.split(\"$s\").size != \"$s\".split(regex).size") },

        { assertEquals(pattern.split(s).size, s.split(pattern).size,
                "pattern.split(\"$s\").size != \"$s\".split(pattern).size") }
    )
}
```
The `Pattern.split()` assertion fails with even-length strings. The test can be made to pass if you have this instead:
```
assertEquals(pattern.split(s, -1).size, s.split(pattern).size)
```
This doesn't seem right though since the documentation for String.split shows `limit: Int = 0` which is contradictory to the above assertion passing. The documentation also makes it seem like `split(Regex)` and `split(Pattern)` should behave the same way for all cases but that is contradicted by the following assertion failing for even-length strings:
```
assertEquals(pattern.split(s).size, regex.split(s).size)
```
This can also be made to pass by specifying a limit of -1 for `pattern.split()`, which doesn't make sense. Per the documentation of [`java.util.regex.Pattern.split()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#split(java.lang.CharSequence,int)) regarding the limit parameter, `regex.split(s)` behaves as though it has a negative limit instead of the declared default of `0`.

Is there any reason this shouldn't be reported as a bug in `String.split()`?
