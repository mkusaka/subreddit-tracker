Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hhv4z1/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

I recently finished my first 4K intro which is completely written in Rust and glsl. It took 1st place at Nova 2020. Have a look at [https://www.codeslow.com/2020/07/writing-winning-4k-intro-in-rust.html](https://www.codeslow.com/2020/07/writing-winning-4k-intro-in-rust.html) for an article of all the techniques used to get the rust code into less than 4096 bytes. The code is at [https://github.com/janiorca/sphere\_dance](https://github.com/janiorca/sphere_dance) or you can see a recording at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIkkYRQ07tU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIkkYRQ07tU)

I swear I watched the videos, read the page several times and it still confuses me in action. I get it right cause of the compiler, but sometimes Iâ€™m like but why
## [10][Using Rust or C/C++ for LED hardware/software project](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hm6wy7/using_rust_or_cc_for_led_hardwaresoftware_project/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hm6wy7/using_rust_or_cc_for_led_hardwaresoftware_project/

I'd like to build custom hardware and software for an LED lighting system. Users will enter our website, and be able to control their lighting system. I'd like to use react / baylon.js (similar to webgl) / go-nginx for the http, and rust mostly for the firmware/backend rbg software. 

All similar projects on GitHub were written in C / C++/Java. I don't really know any of these langs besides hello world. I've recently picked up rust in hopes of using it for a hardware/software idea like this. I love the memory management, compiler, etc.  I think it would be great to use, but have some concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr:

2 questions:

1. How big and active is the current Rust firmware community?
2. Do you think Rust is so new that it will limit the people that contribute to a project like this? I'd like to make the backend fireware/rbg software open source, which might be better to do in C/C++ because more people can contribute??
