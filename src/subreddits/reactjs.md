    import React from 'react';
    import { Typography, Icon } from 'antd';
    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
    import styles from './Header.module.css';
    
    const { Title } = Typography;
    
    const Header = () =&gt; {
        return (
            &lt;div className={ styles.container }&gt;
                &lt;div className={ styles.flexLinks }&gt;
                    &lt;Link to="/home"&gt;
                         &lt;Title className = {styles.link} level = {3}&gt;
                           home
                        &lt;/Title&gt;
                    &lt;/Link&gt;
                    &lt;Link to="/contact"&gt;
                       &lt;Title className = {styles.link} level = {3}&gt;
                         contact
                      &lt;/Title&gt;
                    &lt;/Link&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div style={ styles.mobileIcon }&gt;
                    &lt;Icon style={ styles.menu } type="menu" /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
    export default Header;
    
    //Header.module.css file
    
    .container {
        background-image: url("../../images/dark-paths.png");
        padding: 30px;
        text-align: center;
        display: block;
    }
    
    .link {
      color: white;
    }
    
    .flexLinks {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: space-evenly;
    }

The links inside Title are still black but should be white. The container styling works and if I use an inline style ie

    &lt;Title style = {{color: 'white'}} level = {3}&gt;
         home
    &lt;/Title&gt;

it works fine. I don't want to do this just to make it more manageable overall and consistent. Btw appending !important after it also works but I'm just trying to find the cleanest solution for future reference.

Thanks!
## [7][(Help) Can't import function in a .test.js file](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eokulm/help_cant_import_function_in_a_testjs_file/)

Hi,

I have a basic create-react-app. I installed all Jest dependencies, and created two files:

\- hello.js, which contains a "hello world" function

\- hello.test.js which imports hello() and test it.

I then run yarn jest. The test only works if the function is directly written in the test file. It crashes if I try to import it. Why?

hello.test.js:

    import { hello } from "./hello";
    
    describe("HELLO WORLD", () =&gt; {
      it("returns hello world", () =&gt; {
        expect(hello()).toEqual("hello world!");
      });
    });

hello.js:

    export const hello = () =&gt; "hello world!";

Also, the Jest crashes because of App.js - which I have not even modified -:

     SyntaxError: /Users/mynamee/Desktop/helloapp/src/App.test.js: Unexpected token (6:31)
    
          4 |
          5 | test('renders learn react link', () =&gt; {
        &gt; 6 |   const { getByText } = render(&lt;App /&gt;);
            |                                ^
          7 |   const linkElement = getByText(/learn react/i);
          8 |   expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
          9 | });

Thanks for your help!

Hey, redditors!

I and my friend are working on a side project, that's similar to reddit in the core but will have different features built on top. It's focused around creating like-minded communities. [Everchat](https://everch.at/) will be a place where you can send encrypted text and voice messages, images, videos, files, and more, free from any regulation.

Our mission is to secure, protect, and empower the Internet freedom, and the freedom of speech in general, and our vision is to build the most secure group messaging out there, but the time (and hopefully our future community) will tell.

Right now, you can support us with subscribing to our [Product Hunt Ship page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/everchat) if you have a Product Hunt account, or reserve your user ID directly at [Everchat](https://everch.at/).

All feedback is welcome, and I'm hoping to open up some Internet freedom- or content regulation-related discussion here. üôÇ
## [12][Which is the better way to validate my title text?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eohqfj/which_is_the_better_way_to_validate_my_title_text/)

    state = {
        title: "Text",
        error: null
      };
      changeTitle = e =&gt; {
        this.setState({ title: e.target.value });
        this.validateTitle();
      };
    
      validateTitle() {
        this.setState(state =&gt; {
          return {
            error: state.title.length === 0 ? "Title cant be blank" : null
          };
        });
      }

should I put `validateTitle` in the `componentDidUpdate?`
