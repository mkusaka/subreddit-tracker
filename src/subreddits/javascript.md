## [3][[AskJS] NextJs and SSR, should you bother?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/j19cep/askjs_nextjs_and_ssr_should_you_bother/)

So I see a lot of hype for ssr and nextjs these days, and I was thinking of learning it, but after some research I actually think it is not worth it. It is such a small element of oridinary web development life, I think just learning plain React SSR will be more beneficial. Also google updated chromium last year to latest version to support latest JS indexing, so SEO is not that big of a deal. So, unless you are creating a blog or bad network app, should you bother to invest time in NextJS and SSR?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/j1bb66/askjs_detecting_if_user_or_robot_to_send_pwa_or/
---
Hi,

Someone asked a question on google adsense where he wrote that he would detect if a user or a robot is making a request to his server and would respond with ssr or the pwa accordingly, which would allow him to benefit from both good SEO, monetization and more while also giving the users the advantages of a PWA.

I was wondering how is it possible to detect user or robot, and also about the down sides and other upsides of doing this.

Would love to hear your thoughts
## [8][[AskJS] Why does adding a list of files to an array using fs.readdir in Node returns an empty array?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/j19k6n/askjs_why_does_adding_a_list_of_files_to_an_array/)

I'm trying to scan a directory for images and return the image names in an array using the following code. Unfortunately, all I get back is an empty array. I've also tried the readdirSync method but it gives back the same result.

    module.exports.getImageFiles = function () {
    const path = require("path");
    const fs = require("fs");
    const directoryPath = path.join(__dirname, "/../assets/");
    console.log("this has run!");

    var images = [];

    fs.readdir(directoryPath, function (err, files) {
        if (err) {
            return console.log("Unable to scan directory: " + err);
        }
        for (let i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {
            images.push(files[
        }
    });

    return images;
    };


Edit: Nevermind, I realised I was using readdirSync incorrectly. Here is what worked for me:

`
    const path = require("path");
    const fs = require("fs");
    const directoryPath = path.join(__dirname, "/../assets/");
    const images = fs.readdirSync(directoryPath);
    var imgArray = [];
    for (let i in images) {
        imgArray.push(images[i]);
        // console.log(images[i]);
    }
    return imgArray;
