Hey guys! I am a new content creator at YouTube. I want to cover the tricky parts of javascript. Javascript is little different language. After learning java I decided to learn js. But  I found that javascript behaves little differently than other language. I think second programming language is always the hardest language to learn.
Thinking of that I want to create bunch of videos that can be helpful to others who are starting out .
Please suggest some of the tricky and weird parts of javascript.
Javascript is weird and awesome at the same time
