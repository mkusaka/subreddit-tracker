Hi, I am looking to pick a frontend framework/library for creating a simple REST CRUD website. I have years of experience programming but haven't done much in way of web development. Ideally, the framework I choose will result in some transferable skills/knowledge to a career. Aside from that, I would just like to develop a visually appealing final product that doesn't necessarily need to look unique.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the options I've seen:

* **React-bootstrap**
   * I've used Bootstrap before and am somewhat familiar with it.
   * Seems pretty ubiquitous.
* **Chakra UI**
   * Looks great, but seems relatively new.
* **Vanilla React/HTML/CSS**
   * Best in terms of learning.
   * Most time consuming in terms of getting a final product that looks nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone hit me with some insights? Thanks.
