This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

This is to prevent anyone making the mistake I did.

Googles invalid traffic detection **DOES NOT WORK** for small apps with just a few users. Your **WILL GET BANNED** sooner or later for reasons completely out of your control.

So what should you do:

Use Unity ads or any other service till your app has lots of users. If you have 1k active users switch to adsense and get the increase in profit. There is no point loosing this potential for 20$ a month from your 10 users.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Yes, that should have been AdMob not AdSense, confused them.

I have a music app which is free and has ads in it. There is currently no option to remove ads. Should I add a remove ads option inside the app OR make a whole new separate premium app with no ads and call it a PRO version?

What are your thoughts?

Hello everyone!

I really don't know if this was asked before (maybe it was). 

I have a problem regarding the look of the app when I run it on my mobile phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro). When I open the emulator in Android Studio, the app looks exactly how I expect it to look like, with the design I made. However, when I run it on my phone, TextViews don't show up, the buttons have a different design from the one I made and so on and so forth. The only thing that remained the same is the background design for the layouts of the various activities.

Now, I am thinking if it is a problem related to API level, but I am not sure. Can anyone please help?

Thank you very much!

I have developed an app about four years ago. Two years later I introduced a Pro version of it for which I asked for about 1-2 $ per installation. It has been downloaded about 2,000 times, but also because I made special offers, sometimes giving it for free, etc.

One year ago I have started giving the Pro version for free as well. Now, 12 months later, it will be hitting the 10,000 downloads mark, while Google Play tells me that it's active on about 5,000 devices.

It is an app which is used regulary, e.g. once per day or once per week. When the app is started, then it checks for new updates using my own website. By counting such "checks", I know that the app is started about 400 times on workdays and about 500 times on weekend days.

I have been thinking about adding ads to the app and also enabling In-App purchases in order to deactivate these ads again. Does anyone of you have any experience with ads &amp; in-app purchases with a comparable number of app users ? Could it be worth it or would it be just a waste of time ?

If you are interested in seeing the app, then you can check the sub r/ConsumptionManager. There's also a link to Google Play there.

Any thoughts are highly appreciated.

That's the question, do you publish your apps in the store using a brand name or your real name? Why?

After closing android studio when developing a medium sized project.

Android Studio has come a long way optimizing memory and improving performance. Still one of the issues I constantly face is that it sometimes doesn't clean up the gradle daemons. So, once in a while I have to check and kill some daemons myself. 

Also after using Android Studio for a while the RAM usage just keeps on increasing. It feels to me Android Studio is doing over caching. After 2-3 hours of use Android Studio alone takes 3.5-4 GB of RAM along with gradle daemons taking around 4-5GB of memory and the build time starts to increase. So I have to restart Android Studio and kill all gradle daemons.

How is your experience with Android Studio?
