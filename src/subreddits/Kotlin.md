Hey folks, I have a question that in my team we have different opinions about this question. 

Is it better to use a KT file that holds more than one class or not?  for example, in android, I have a file that holds an Adapter class and its ViewHolder class. A friend of mine says that breaks the single responsibility in SOLID. Can you tell me about what do you think?

I'm new to Kotlin and I was wondering what's the best way to design your JPA entities? I've seen some examples for very basic Kotlin+JPA usage and they all used `val` for all fields within the entity which is a nice design but introduces the problem that you can't manipulate the values of an existing entity.

Those examples never manipulate an existing entity attached to the Hibernate session. 

What do you think is the best way?
## [4][why do i need the (Int)-&gt;Unit for the lambda function definition ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/ffe7uz/why_do_i_need_the_intunit_for_the_lambda_function/)

        fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;){  
            val myLambda: (Int) -&gt; Unit= {s: Int -&gt; println(s) } //lambda function  
            addNumber(5,10,myLambda)  
        }  
        fun addNumber(a: Int, b: Int, mylambda: (Int) -&gt; Unit ){   //high level function lambda as parameter  
            val add = a + b  
            mylambda(add) // println(add)  
        }  

what is the need to use it in both the definition and lambda function call in the addnumber function?

## [6][Return result to activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/ffh26r/return_result_to_activity/)

Im trying to use coroutines in android and I want to return result to the UI(fragment), so I did the following:

Inside the repository class:

`suspend fun saveNotes(text : String) : Deferred&lt;String?&gt; {return CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).async {saveNotesToDb(text)}}`

`suspend fun saveNotesToDb(text: String) : String? {var result : String? = ""try{val notes = Notes(notes = text)notesDb.notesDAO.insertNote(notes)result = "saved data to the database"return result}catch (e: Exception){print(e.stackTrace)result = e.messagereturn result}}`

So basically I create suspend function saveNotesToDB, and then in another function saveNotes I return a Deferred object so I can use the result later. Then inside the viewmodel i do the following:

`suspend fun setNotes(text : String) : String? {return notesRepository.saveNotes(text).await()}`

So I thought I can use await() here to get the result, but then again in the fragment I need to create a suspend function, how can I leave the suspend function. All i want is for the result to go from the repository --&gt; viewmodel --&gt; display in fragment inside a snackbar

Can someone please tell me how to fix this

Finished this recently, a kotlin only implementaiton of the CommonMark MarkDown spec, was a pretty interesting deeper dive into kotlin than I have ever done before, did profiling on a project for the first time, had to design the architecture of a medium sized project, and face some of the consequences of some of my decisions and how they impacted the programming experience
