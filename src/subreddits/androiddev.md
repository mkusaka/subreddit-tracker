Hey guys, I have been creating a mobile game and I really wanted to have an avatar face creation/customization system in the game so players can each make their unique avatars. I've seen lots of apps recently that all use a very similar style of avatars (trivia royale as an example and they all look like memojis). I was wondering if they all made their own avatar system independently that just all happened to look pretty much the same, or is there some avatar face customization SDK or asset that all of these companies are using. As a quick follow up question, if I were to make my own avatar face customization system, how would i go about doing it? Thanks guys!

Posting from a throwaway account.

I recently got shortlisted at a Jakarta based startup. I have 5+ years of exp building a handful of successful apps for startups. I also have 2 side projects that are doing well. They shortlisted my profile and assigned a coding test - it was basically about building an offline-first app using MVVM and Kotlin. I properly architected the app, focused on every tiny detail and met every requirement to ensure it's high quality. A week after, they reverted with a positive response and scheduled a call. However, the person interviewing me is a CTO and did not talk anything about the submitted assignment, and held a 1 hour database-design-interview for an specific offline feature. I basically failed this round, because my hands-on experience with SQL is confined to trivial queries on Android. Not that it was super-hard, I just don't have the muscle memory for it to think quickly. Their job-description did not say anything about wanting good skills with SQL either.

I was hoping the interviewer would be curious and ask questions regarding my approach in the assignment and so on. But none of that happened!

Anyone had a similar experience? Is it expected that once coding assignment is cleared, the following rounds often have nothing to do with it? If yes, then what is the point of assigning coding tests in such a manner?

Our app is on the store for 5 years now, we have had over dozen updates last year or so, our latest submission is being delayed since 25th June, no response other than we are prioritizing reviews for app (Which apparently isn't).  
Contacted google play via twitter DM, the only response is stay tuned, we are prioritizing reviews for app, thats it nothing else, ah and advising us to refrain from resubmitting the app so the cycle is not reset.

Anyone else experiencing the same issues ? We are a B2B company, and our clients are already complaining (Promised bug fixes and paid features for them).

Is it possible to choose the displayed developer name for an app(a name that is not the google account name)? I want to publish an app to the play store, and want to use my main google account, but I a worried that it will show as my name instead of my company name as the app maker in the listing.
## [12][what is the alternative of setFragmentResult?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hqd113/what_is_the_alternative_of_setfragmentresult/)

I am trying to communicate between fragments. 
On attach I set a reference to the  parent Activity which is a FragmentActivity on child fragments.
I tried to call `parent.getSupportFragmentManager.setFragmentResult("key", bundleOf("k" to "v" ))`
but apparently setFragmentResult no longer exists under FragmentManager. 
Is there any alternative to this for message passing between fragments or am i supposed to pass callbacks all over the place through the main activity ?
