**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

Hi everyone,

I'm quite new to C++ programming, and it seems that compile-time programming is very trendy (at least in this sub).

I struggle to understand the use-case of compile-time programming. From what I understand, the compiler does most of the computation, and it results in a very small binary, where you're basically only outputting the result of the compiler computations (It is  probably a very simplistic understanding, probably even false ..!)

But as I understand it, there is no free-lunch, and someone still has to do the computation. With this approach, the work happens at compile time instead of runtime, but how can it be applied in the real world, where most programs receive input data, do some stuff, then output a result ?

If I understand correctly, a compile time program can not do any sort of IO at runtime, and would therefore be useless in an application that needs to process data ?

I would be really grateful to anyone capable of explaining how compile-time programming can be used, or just pointing me to the right link (I did not find the answer to my question on Google :()

Thanks!

Hi!

I wanted to share the channel of Adam Fowler. I discovered trough a retweet of Andreas Kling. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is making a database from the ground up in modern C++ using TDD and good practices for carrying on the project. His roadmap covers a lot of really interesting things about SQL and No-SQL databases. He is on the third video of the series.
