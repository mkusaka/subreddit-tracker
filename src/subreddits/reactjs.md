Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

I feel you can learn more by watching someone fix up an application rather than building it from the ground up. Is there any tutorial like that?

Hey,

I'm React developer and I build something called [NoCodeAPI](https://nocodeapi.com/) tool to build third-party applications without any code. So, I can focus on my front-end and will use these NoCodeAPI.

Like you can make Google Sheet, Airtable, Google Analytics, Cloudinary, Contentful, Slack, Telegram Hook, Link Preview, Twitter, XML-JSON, Medium, Ghost.

**What problem I'm solving with NoCodeAPI?**

To set up any service you need some basic things like a Server, Basic Knowledge to code backend for this, keep tracking of APIs logs, Time to do all these things. So, why not solve these problems to make development quick.

**Time-Saving** \- with NoCodeAPI you can build any third party application in less than 10 seconds. Just add key values that are required to access your services.

**Simple &amp; Easy Documentation** \- we have minimal and easy documentation to quickly start using and access the required data.

**Securing Keys** \- With NoCodeAPI you are securing your tokens like access\_token, client id, secret id, and your inputs. You can see NoCodeAPI endpoint without exposing any of these.

**Bypass Rate Limit** \- All services public APIs have request limit to not get the system abused. So, with NoCodeAPI you can solve this big problem. Like Airtable has 5 requests per second.

**API Logs** \- You can track your NoCodeAPI logs into the browser if its success or error. This type of logs view is not provided by lots of services. This is a win-win situation.

**Fast** \- NoCodeAPI using caching technology to improve the performance of the APIs. So, use these NoCode API to empower your project.

Just give a try with free and let me know what you think about this.

Thanks :)

I already posted this project before here and got a positive feedback. It really made me happy. I then proceeded to add a Dark Theme toggle support and preconfigured Wordpress backend. I also improved the documentation a bit. 

I used Wordpress REST API as my backend and CRA as my frontend. I'm using Typescript &amp; React Redux hooks.  I hope you enjoy the APP!

Hi, is there any minimal solution to add an emoji picker to a text input (I'm using react), I managed to use emojimart but the bundle size is too big, or should I implement mine and that's it or is there any efforts done by the community(I believe there is cause it's a pretty known use case)

## [8][React render patterns (children, props, component injection...)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/etpcyv/react_render_patterns_children_props_component/)

I would like to conduct a little survey. Let's say you have to create a `Tag` component that can have: an icon in the left, in the right, both sides and no icon. Something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/XcNP6dq).

And you already have an `Icon` component that looks something like this

    const Icon = ({ color, name }) =&gt; { ... }

Now, which one of these options for the API of `Tag` you think is best and why:

## Option 1

Supply different props and use children (or another prop) for the text.

    &lt;Tag
      iconLeft="add"
      iconRight="close"
      onClickLeft={...}
      onClickRight={...}
    &gt;
      Hello // Or as a prop
    &lt;/Tag&gt;

## Option 2

Group icon props by sides and use an object.

    &lt;Tag
      iconLeft={{
        name: "add",
        onClick={...},
      }}
      iconRight={{
        name: "close",
        onClick={...}
      }}
    &gt;
      Hello
    &lt;/Tag&gt;

## Option 3

In last examples the `Icon` component was used under the hood by doing something like this:

    const Tag = ({ iconLeft, iconRight }) =&gt; {
      return (
        &lt;div&gt;
           // Notice that color is not supplied since you don't want it to change.
           &lt;Icon name={iconLeft.name} color="dark" /&gt; 
           ...
        &lt;/div&gt;
      )
    }

So instead of doing this you directly use children and original icon component like this.

    &lt;Tag&gt;
      &lt;Icon name="add" onClick={...} /&gt;
      Hello
      &lt;Icon name="close" onClick={...} /&gt;
    &lt;/Tag&gt;

The problem with this approach is that the user may incorrectly set the color. You could use something like `React.cloneElement` and overriding that prop, but it seems hacky. Also, the children can be put in incorrect order. But assume you are using Typescript so you can prevent that last one.

## Option 4

Create a custom `TagIcon` component for solving the above problems.

    &lt;Tag&gt;
      &lt;TagIcon name="add" onClick={...} /&gt;
      Hello
      &lt;TagIcon name="close" onClick={...}  /&gt;
    &lt;/Tag&gt;

Maybe you can stretch a little further and do something like:

    &lt;Tag&gt;
      &lt;TagIcon name="add" onClick={...} /&gt;
      &lt;TagText&gt;Hello&lt;/TagText&gt;
      &lt;TagIcon name="close" onClick={...} /&gt;
    &lt;/Tag&gt;

The first options are fine, but I have to admit that the last ones are more readable and even extensible. Of course that may be a bad thing. Specially with bigger components (imagine a dropdown group) the children pattern may be better.

Also, you could inject the component as a prop, but I think you get what I'm after.

What do you think? Do you have any other suggestions?
## [9][Advice needed, React file getting very big](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/etniui/advice_needed_react_file_getting_very_big/)

Hi all,

I am starting to notice a potential problem with the way I am structuring my React application.

I like to architect my components by having one file that acts as a container and multiple stateless components that get passed data and event emitters via props  
. This container will contain all the state, API Calls, and event handlers. This container will render child components that are stateless.

Here is an example of a structure I use:

    - folder   
      - index.js &lt;-- container file
      - childComponent1.js
      - childComponent2.js
      - childComponent3.js
      - childComponent4.js
      ...

The size of the container file and the number of child components depend on how big a feature is. The problem I had recently was that there was a very big feature that I had to implement, and while I like to use this structure, I started to realize that my container file got very big, like almost 1000 lines of code big. Now, I'm not sure if this is an issue, but seeing 1000 lines of code in one file concerns me. There is just a lot of state to keep track as well as event handlers to read/set new state.

I'm wondering if there is any workaround for this. I don't use global state management like Redux as I feel that my application doesn't have a lot of global states that are widely used throughout the application. 

And I guess a question I have is.. is this considered 'okay'? 

Any answers or tips are welcomed!

Thank you all!

Hi, I understand concept of functional components but want to make full transition.

So far I am using useState with functional components if I need internal state. 

My main App was class but I will also change to function with useState. Alongside I am using Context to manage global state for things like authentification, themes, etc and pass local state from App to children components.

With this settings, isn't it better to just put everything in Context provider and don't bother with useState in main App function? Or is it better for performance and re-render reasons to separate global state from Context provider from local useState from main App function?
