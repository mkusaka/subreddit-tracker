I built a tool to visualise streaming data in the terminal. You can plot any command that can be piped into stdin. Its super handy for quickly visualising trends in the terminal.

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/Martin-Nyaga/termplot)!

Hey guys I was just wondering what the difference between the two is. When I do array.dup all of the elements of the array have their original object IDs. However, if I do array.clone.map(&amp;:clone) then I get different objects IDs. Can someone explain how this works in memory? Thank you.

Edit : What does this mean?  "*the* instance variables of *obj* are copied, but not the objects they reference "
