I know Jetbrains folks are working with Google on porting the Jetpack compose to Desktop (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/androidx-master-dev/compose/ui/ui/src/desktopMain/kotlin/androidx/compose?autodive=0%2F) and I am curious if Jetbrains/Google have any plans to port the same to Web or making it a multiplatform library?  I am asking here as I asked this question multiple times in the recent Kotlin event and got no answer :)
## [2][Which JVM version should I target?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jdxr7a/which_jvm_version_should_i_target/)

Hey there, I‘m relatively new to Kotlin and am still wondering which jvm version I should target with Kotlin. 
The Kotlin faq says that I can target anything between 8 and 13. why is that? Why not 14 or 15? And I thought it was compatible with Java 6 as well for android development?

Can someone shed some light on this for me? What are the advantages and disadvantages of choosing older or newer versions? If it is performance, are there any numbers how much better it performs on newer jvm versions?

Thanks in advance!

Just a quick question about syntax and the difference from Java.

I've recently written my first actual project in Kotlin and plan to release it to the Play Store, but I'm concerned that, since Kotlin also supports Java syntax, that my code isn't as 'Kotlin-y' as it could be. Is there some service that can scan my code and reformat it to more Kotlin-accurate ssyntax, like how the IntelliJ IDEA converts Java files to Kotlin files? I'd like to see how it should look for the sake of learning. 

Thanks in advance.

I’m mainly a C++ / Haskell developer, plus I know Python and am planning to learn Rust (probably before Kotlin), but I have zero experience with JVM languages.

For the purposes of Android development, I want to learn Kotlin. Can you please recommend any good resources to do that (books, free online courses etc.), **preferably without touching Java** (if at all possible)?
