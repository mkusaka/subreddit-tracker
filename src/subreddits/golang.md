Hi everyone! I'm Jon Calhoun, one of the panelists on the Go Time podcast. For those of you unfamiliar - it is a Go podcast that we record live every Tuesday at 3pm ET. We usually have a guest or two on each episode, and discuss a specific topic (defer, testing, databases, infra, etc). You can check it out here: &lt;https://changelog.com/gotime&gt;

This coming episode we want to try something a little different - we want to make a Q&amp;A episode. There are two reasons for doing this:

1. We are hoping this inspires topics for future episodes.
2. We want a venue to discuss questions that don't really fit into an entire episode on their own.

To make this happen we would like everyone here to post any Go-related questions that you would like us to discuss on air, and we will try to get to as many as possible. I'll also try to type up answers here while we discuss them on the episode.

We will be answering questions live tomorrow, Tuesday, Sep 8. We will repeat questions on air, and since we record live you can join in on the Gophers Slack to ask follow-up questions or to elaborate on questions.

[Asynq](https://github.com/hibiken/asynq) is a Redis-backed task queue library in Go.

The library has always supported connecting to a single Redis instance or connecting to Redis using Sentinels.

With v0.12 release, the library now [supports Redis Cluster](https://github.com/hibiken/asynq/wiki/Redis-Cluster). It shards task data by queue, so the application developer has control over how the data are split. It also comes with the CLI support, just append `--cluster` flag to run the commands against Redis cluster.

I'm writing a small daemon for personal use -- 1 user -- and I'd like to retain the ability to manually edit the data with my editor. I'm not yet sure how many rows, but I doubt it'll be more than 1,000. Might have a few "tables" (CSV files) with cross-referenced IDs (probably just mirroring line numbers).

I'm wondering if anyone has experience / insights using CSV for this. I came across a project that allowed querying CSV with SQL -- that's overkill for my use case. And I'll also be writing to the file -- updating rows.

I'm wondering if there are known limits to this approach. E.g., does it start to get perceptibly slow at 100,000 or 1,000,000 rows? Are field updates tedious because you have to scan newlines, then commas -- and then deal with insertions?

Any recommended literature for working with the filesystem like this?

Still just exploring the idea -- apologies for the lack of detail.
