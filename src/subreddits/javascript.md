Hi,

i have a script which starts with the following and works fine when left as it is:

&amp;#x200B;

but I'm wanting to pass parameters from another page into the xhr URL

example:

**input.html**

have 2 input boxes requesting Type + Year and on submit, output.html is loaded with the relevant URL

**Output.html**

    &lt;script&gt;dojoConfig = {parseOnLoad: true}&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.9.1/dojo/dojo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    require(['dojo/_base/lang', 'dojox/grid/DataGrid', 'dojo/data/ItemFileWriteStore', 'dojo/dom', 'dojo/domReady!', 'dojo/request/xhr'],
    function (lang, DataGrid, ItemFileWriteStore, Button, dom, xhr) {
     
        // make the API request with dojo/request/xhr
        xhr('/api-rest/get/PRG001/ListDocs?Type=1&amp;Year=2020', {
           method: 'GET',
           withCredentials: true,
           user: 'user1',
           password: '********',
           headers: {'Accept': 'application/json'},
           handleAs: 'json',
        }).then(render);
