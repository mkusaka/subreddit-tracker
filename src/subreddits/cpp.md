Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I created my first little project with C++.  
It is just a simple time tracker with an interactive command line.

## [3][When to use a reference type versus a pointer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ezwij0/when_to_use_a_reference_type_versus_a_pointer/)

I've been digging back into C++ recently and while I do have a good understanding of pointers, reference types are new to me.  I've found plenty of documentation about what reference types are and how they work, but very little advice on **when** to use them in practice.

Any thoughts?

Just listened to the recent cpp.chat episode (67) about CopperSpice (CS). No mentioning of Qt, doxygen. I'm a bit concerned, that CS is just a rip-off of these  frameworks, tools. Any opinions/experience with CS?

Do you guys throw the whole kitchen sink in? Do you disable specific checks if you don't agree with them/if they don't fit? Or do you only pick certain groups of checks from the beginning? Curious about what may be standard.

Since a lot of programmers come to C++ for performance reasons, why don't some of the bigger games come bundled with their own super performant OS that you boot into when you want to play such game? As long as driver support is maintained, I can't imagine there's much more work to be done. All the OS needs to do is boot into the game, not provide a full desktop experience.  
Is that what SteamOS is? I don't know, I totally missed the boat on the whole Steam revolution in gaming, honestly, all I know it's just an online shop where you can download games.
