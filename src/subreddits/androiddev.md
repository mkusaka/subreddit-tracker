This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I'm trying to improve my testing game, but most lessons online seem to include only trivial contrived examples of tests, so I was wondering if anyone knew of some open source projects that use Jetpack components and have some real world tests in them to learn from?

Hi,

  
Look at this:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=skydragon.honorofkings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=skydragon.honorofkings)

So this game has 6 screenshots, 4 of them showing soft porn images of sexy women's ass.

  
My question is is this actually works? Can I sell better my app with showing erotic images?

Is there anybody who A/B tested this and actually has data which prove that this works?  


You can see the screenshotsb below:

The obvious answer would be yes, but I would like to make sure. Thanks.

Today when trying to click on any of my apps from the Play Console homepage, I get a red bar with "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later." I've tried on multiple browsers and internet connections with no luck. Anyone else having this issue?

Edit: The guy in the comments who said "Messaged" sent me a message stating he would fix my issue for $50 over paypal. Obviously he is full of it so if someone else is here looking for help don't fall for that.
