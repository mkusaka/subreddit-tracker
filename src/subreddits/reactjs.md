Here's a hook that takes a component's ref, and has its own boolean ref  (consider current = isOpen).

     function useHideShow(ref) {
        let { current } = useRef(false)
        function hideShow() {
        	if (current) {
    	    current = false
    	    ref.current.style.display = 'none'
    	} else {
    	    current = true
    	    ref.current.style.display = 'block'
            }
        }
        return hideShow
    }

How to use it :

    const Dropdown = () =&gt; {
        const down = useRef()
        const hideShow = useHideShow(down)
        return (
    	&lt;div&gt;
    	    &lt;div id="drop" onClick={hideShow}&gt;Drop&lt;/div&gt;
    	    &lt;div id="down" ref={down}&gt;Down&lt;/div&gt;
    	&lt;/div&gt;
        )
    }

Is it bad practice to interact with the dom like this ? What's your opinion on this hook ?

Udemy is having a promo at the moment and wanted to get a react course. 

Looked on the sub which ones were most recommended and there looked to be a tie between Stephen Grider and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Leaning towards Grider right now but both look good. 

Anyway, my question is if getting 3 courses right off the bat is overkill, wanted to get them now during the promo. These are the ones that I was looking at, wanted a base for react but also one to help me connect node and react in a proper manner. Have already played around with create-react-app and published it on Heroku and got it working but need more meat on my bones and learn how to properly do things. 

With my own project, I got stuck when I needed to create user sign up and log in and do it properly.

Hello,

This seems like such an easy thing, but I have not been able to figure it out for the past couple of days. 

I want to make a HTTP request each time the user lands at a URL/view, say '/forum-messages', so they can get the latest messages. However, I only want it to be called once when they are on this view. 

I know I can use useEffect and only have it be called once, but the problem is it's only being called once during the entire life of the application session. If I add the request outside of useEffect, then obviously it's called every single time the app refreshes. 

So how do you make a call only once during the views life, but each time it's visited by the user (each NEW visit)?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be greatly aprpeciated!
