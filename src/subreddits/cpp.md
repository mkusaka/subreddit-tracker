**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

## [3][C++ is brilliant](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hmj4s5/c_is_brilliant/)

I'm working on a Vulkan renderer, and needed to delay destruction of render scenes since the graphics pipeline has render buffers in flight, so destruction has to happen N frames after the user destroys a class.  With C++, I can use **private destructors** to force users to add the scene to a managed destructor queue (aka garbage collect queue).  Normally language purists will scorn a language which allows such shenanigans, however in real world production code, its features like this which allows developers to create modern software.   So with a couple of lines of code, I solved my delayed destructor issue.  Thank you C++ committee for creating a usable language.
## [4][What would it take to allow forward declaration of typedefs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hmpult/what_would_it_take_to_allow_forward_declaration/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hmpult/what_would_it_take_to_allow_forward_declaration/
---
Quite a lot of the time it would be conveniant to allow forward declaration of typedefs. So lets say I'm using the rapidjson library as an example, and I want to create `Thing` out of a rapidjson value, but I don't want to leak that whole library to everyone who consumes `Thing`. What I want to do is this.

    namespace rapidjson {
        typedef Value;
    }
    
    class Thing
    {
        Thing( const rapidjson::Value&amp; v );
        ...
    };

But you can't forward declare a typedef. Instead you have to redeclare the whole thing like so:

    typedef GenericValue&lt;UTF8&lt;char&gt;, MemoryPoolAllocator&lt;CrtAllocator&gt; &gt; Value;

Ah, but I don't have any of those classes declared either. So we need these too.

    template&lt;typename CharType&gt; struct UTF8;
    template &lt;typename Encoding, typename Allocator&gt; 
    class GenericValue;
    class CrtAllocator;
    template &lt;typename BaseAllocator&gt;
    class MemoryPoolAllocator;
    typedef GenericValue&lt;UTF8&lt;char&gt;, MemoryPoolAllocator&lt;CrtAllocator&gt; &gt; Value;

And look, we just barfed a whole pile of garbage into the top of our file, not to mention that this could easily become out of date when the library is updated.

So a typical solution to that is each library having some header like `#include &lt;rapidjson/fwd.h&gt;` in order to forward declare all the various template types. In the case of rapidjson this header is itself 150 lines. All I wanted was to forward declare a type!

Now the reason I have seen given that we can't do this is that typedefs don't really create a type, just an alias. This means that the compiler converts your typedef to the mangled name.

But is that really all there is to it? Can nobody think of a way?

What we if we made it so you can't call a function with a declared but not defined typedef? That way we could be sure that by the time the compiler actually needs to care to resolve the typedef, the actual definition is available? Would that be enough of a rule to allow compilers to easily implement something like this?

The other road would be allowing for typedefs that are actually seperate types, which I would be suprised if it had not been proposed before.

`typedef class` maybe?

Anyone have any suggestions?

I was searching for the historical rationale behind the `= 0` syntax for pure virtual functions (just curiosity). It seems to me that this could have been at the time some kind of abuse of how vtables where generated, such that it actually initialized a null pointer or something. So far, I haven't been able to find whatever would back this up or otherwise explain this syntax. Any hints?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hmqg6i/why_stdto_string_is_note_templated/
---
As stated [here][1] `std::string` is not a template function but rather the standard choose to use function overloading to provide this function for different types. My question is why use overloading when template/specialisation seems to make more sense to me in this case? Consider that if the standard has defined something like this:

```
template &lt;typename T&gt;
std::string std::to_string(const T&amp; v);
```

Then we can freely add specialisation for any type in our program to conform to this signature, thus C++ will have a uniform way to transform types into human-readable strings. Why not do this? What's the thinking behind the current design?

In this paper [https://stroustrup.com/wrapper.pdf](https://stroustrup.com/wrapper.pdf) Bjarne Stroustrup overloaded operator-&gt;()  to insert pieces of code before and after each function calls.

In paragraph 10 "Limitations" he wrote 

&gt; A  fundamental  limitation  of  this  prefix/suffix  approach  is  that  neither  prefix  nor  suffix  has  access  to  the arguments  to  the  called  function  or  the  result  produced.   For  example,  it  is  not  possible  to  provide  a prefix/suffix  to  record  the  results  of  calls  or  to  map  calls  into  message  send  operations.   In  this,  the prefix/suffix approach differs from the Tiemann wrappers \[Tiemann,1988\]. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any idea of what Tiemann's approach was ?

Bjarne put in his references *"\[Tiemann,1988\] Michael Tiemann:‘‘Wrappers:’’  Solving  the  RPC  problem  in  GNU  C++.   Proc.USENIX C++Conference.  Denver,  CO.  October  1988."*  but my google-fu is not sharp enough to find the source.

## [12][New library: Font Chef](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlvmqf/new_library_font_chef/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlvmqf/new_library_font_chef/
---
Hey all!

I'm releasing a new library, called Font Chef, to assist in text rendering. Its purpose is to create an atlas of selected glyphs from unicode blocks and produce source and target rectangles to clip and render the atlas into the screen. It is basically an abstraction of the great [stb\_truetype](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h)

It handles kerning, wrapping (line breaking) and alignment. It is also fully documented with examples and a manual.

Example for C:

    fc_font * font = fc_construct(font_data, fc_px(30), fc_color_black);
    fc_add(fc_basic_latin.start, fc_basic_latin.end);
    fc_cook(font);
    // use fc_get_pixels(font) to make a texture
        
    const char hello[] = "Hello, world!";
    fc_character_mapping output[32];
    int count = fc_render(font, text, strlen(hello), &amp;output);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
        render(texture, output[i].source, output[i].target
    }

It comes with a C++ wrapper. Example for C++:

    fc::font font = fc
          ::from(font_data, fc::px(30), fc_color_black)
          .add(fc_basic_latin)
          .cook();
    
    // use font.pixels() to make a texture
    
    fc::render_result result = font.render("Hello, world!");
    for (auto &amp; map : result) {
        render(texture, map.source, map.target);
    }

I believe this is mostly useful to those handling directly with graphics rendering (aka game developers with their own engine) but I hope it is useful to you if you're not in that group.

Opinions and constructive criticism are very much welcome.
