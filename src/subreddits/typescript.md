The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring companyâ€”no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).

AdminBro is an automated admin interface for Node.js apps based on React, written in TypeScript = Django admin for node on steroids !!!

Now, we almost finish the entire scope for v2.0 and we released it along with the demo version: 

Demo page can be found here:

[https://admin-bro-example-app-staging.herokuapp.com/admin](https://admin-bro-example-app-staging.herokuapp.com/admin)

Github repo is here: [https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro)

and you can install it using: 

```
yarn add admin-bro@2.0.0-beta.26
```

In this version: 

* there is an entire Design System written specially for AdminBro
* i18n support
* hooks support
* the entire UI change to Drawer'like exploring resources

Now we are working on the documentation which (WiP) can be fond here:

Let me know what do you think - and star the repo if you like the idea :)
## [9][OpenAPI Generator now supports Angular 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f6u6jr/openapi_generator_now_supports_angular_9/)

Thanks for the enhancement by [topce](https://github.com/topce)

Here are 3 simple steps to generate TypeScript Angular 9 client given an OpenAPI spec (e.g. [Petstore API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml)):

1. Download the Java JAR (Snapshot) ([https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/openapi-generator-cli-4.3.0-20200220.141445-113.jar](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/openapi-generator-cli-4.3.0-20200220.141445-113.jar))
2. Rename the JAR as "openapi-generator-cli.jar"
3. Run the following command to generate a TypeScript Angular 9 client for the Petstore API ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml)):

Mac/Linux:

\- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g typescript-angular -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o /var/tmp/typescript-angular/

Windows:

\- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g typescript-angular -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o C:\\tmp\\typescript-angular

To generate an older version of TypeScript Angular client, use `ngVersion`. For example, to generate Angular 8 client:

\- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g typescript-angular -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o /var/tmp/typescript-angular/ --additional-properties ngVersion=8
