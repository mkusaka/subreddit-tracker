Im not a pro at react by any means but I finished the codecademy course and made some simple apps in react and react native but it feel like I still don't know core Javascript and don't really want to do codecademy again because their courses are really verbose and not that helpful. I already know Java so I don't want a course that goes over things like loops, conditionals, arrays, etc.

In the following code:

    const getAll = async () =&gt; {
         const retrievedData = await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/anecdotes');  [2nd line of execution]   
         return retrievedData.data; // - [Not executed]
    };
    
    const test =  () =&gt; {
         let anecdotes =  getAll();       [1st line of execution]         
     console.log(anecdotes);          [3rd line of execution] 
     props.initAnecdotes(anecdotes);  [4th line of execution] 
    };
    
    test();

**Why is the return statement not being executed?**

**Also, why isn't the await not pausing until axios get request data is retrieved?**

Thanks
