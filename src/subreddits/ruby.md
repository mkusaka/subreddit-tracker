Hi all,

I just wanted to post to say that [ops\_team](https://github.com/nickthecook/ops), a gem I've been working on since April, has hit the 1.0.0 release.

It has 13k downloads, so thanks to everyone who has been using it. However, I've had no feedback at all, and I'd *really like* to hear what people think, even if it's just some info about what they use it for and whether it works or not.

Did that evolve/change in different versions of ruby. I am referring a book that's written based on v4.x of rails and I am using 5.x .

So ima semi noob in the ruby/rails world, like many before me I rushed to simply skim the basics and start building, but I hit many walls and spent even more time reading than building, that's when it hit me I should just put in the time to simply learn everything right and stop this self-imposed rush I'm in.

Just learned about Procs and Lambdas and I am stuck in the concept of Lambdas and Procs, I understand the syntax and how to build one, but can't for the life of me find practical or real-world applications for when to use these over simply defining a method.

Can someone please elaborate on this plz! Thank you in advance

Hey everyone ✌️

I just want to present you [PoliteText](https://github.com/OpenGems/polite_text), a Ruby Gem that I've created. 

It allows you to automatically remove the swear words (or any words you want) from your users' input.

While I was building [stanza.dev](https://stanza.dev), I needed a way to automatically remove swear words from users' posts and I could not do this work manually by monitoring every posts. So I have built this gem and I hope that you will like it !

Feel free to contribute or to give me feedbacks,

Cheers ✌️

Olivier

## [10][Promises in Ruby? Particularly in "ruby-concurrency"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jpmb10/promises_in_ruby_particularly_in_rubyconcurrency/)

Gem [https://github.com/ruby-concurrency](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency)

There're some examples in the documentation, but there're so many methods and functions in **Promise**, that it's confusing how to use it at all, and which functions to use and in what cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there simple real examples of how to use Promises, how to chain them, wait for them to resolve and so on?

Or what gem would you recommend instead? A library that's used by many people, yet simple and decent. I don't need a gem that's abandoned or use by few people.
