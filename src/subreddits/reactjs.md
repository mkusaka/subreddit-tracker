Took this quarantine time to learn React and have fallen in love! I have been a front end developer for about 5 years and have never had the time or need to use React, but took this time to learn it and so far it's been awesome! Took my love of video games and streaming and created a React app called Shuffle. Takes all of the streams under 50 viewers from a game and puts them in an array and then selects a random one to show! Would love some feedback on the code and design. Thanks!

Hey all,

I spent the last two weeks building a 4 player browser-based game similar to Cards Against Humanity in React and Socket.io, and I'm launching it today!

It's called Gameslap: [https://gameslap.io](https://gameslap.io)

You and up to three of your friends &amp; family can play together remotely. It's played 100% in your browser, and it's real-time, thanks to the awesome power of [Socket.io](https://Socket.io).

If you have any questions on how I built it, please ask away!

So it turns out I've been wasting a lot of time watching TV during quarantine.

So to capitalize, I decided to start a personal project this week and this is what I've been able to do so far! It's a working product but there are a lot of things I'm looking to add over the next few weeks.

It's my first time dealing with hooks and animations but I think I'm slowly catching on. 

Let me know what you think!
