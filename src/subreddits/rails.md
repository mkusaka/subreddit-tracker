## [3][best VSCode extensions for Ruby/Rails](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fz3muy/best_vscode_extensions_for_rubyrails/)

thought it would be a great place to ask here, does anyone have a list of some of the best VSCode extensions to have for Ruby and Rails development?  

I actually have too many that I got from a recommended source and now my format selection keyboard shortcut isn't even working on one laptop, but may just strip out all the extensions and start bare on that. Though, that system is an  Ubuntu system.

EDIT: FWIW, I did actually find this

So... basically all sources I‚Äôve seen use Heroku for hosting or ‚Äúproduction/deployment.‚Äù Why not AWS, GoDaddy, WordPress, etc. what‚Äôs the trade off aside from the Heroku integration?

Newbie here, just wondering if you guys have a solid source that can explain WebPack to me. I saw a video on YouTube from the 2019 conference, but I didn‚Äôt find it very helpful on implementation. Just said what it does which leaves more questions than it has answers for a beginner. Extra brownie points if you can give me an ELI5 on this.

Hey Everyone,  
I hope you all doing very well.  
Well I have a web app with devise authentication and social login Facebook and Google, now we are going to create mobile app for our web app. I am very confused about the best approach to integrate API authentication with devise and social logins I found about devise-jwt and devise-aut-token and jwt gem but I don't know how and where to start.  
I hope you can give me some hints how to do that keep in my mind the web app is fully functional and now it's only about the API.  


and thanks in advance

 Hey Guys, I'm very new to rails.  
I'm looking to create something very similar to facebook events, in that a user can create an event.  
Users (event members ) can post messages on the event.  
Users can also comment on the event posts.

I'm very lost here and would really appreciate some help
## [11][What installs activerecord-sqlserver-adapter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fypzyc/what_installs_activerecordsqlserveradapter/)

Hi,

I see that something is installing activerecord-sqlserver-adapter-5.2.1 on our server.

I did "gem dependency activerecord-sqlserver-adapter --reverse-dependencies"

and it shows:

\-----

Gem activerecord-sqlserver-adapter-5.2.1

activerecord (\~&gt; 5.2.0)

tiny\_tds (&gt;= 0)

\-----

However, activerecord doesn't require that gem.

tiny\_tds isn't specified anywhere in my app's Gemfile.

Why is that gem is installed? How can I find out?

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is there is a tiny\_tds gem comes with it and I cannot figure out why it wasn't needed before and our app is working perfectly fine on production without it.

I'm sure it's something very stupid but can anyone see why the action is not triggering? (Connect() is running so the controller is being invoked ok)

    &lt;div class="field" data-controller="photo-upload"&gt;
      &lt;label class="label"&gt;Photos&lt;/label&gt;
    
        &lt;div class="file has-name is-boxed"&gt;
        &lt;label class="file-label"&gt;
          
            &lt;input as="hidden" class="is-hidden" type="file" name="review[review_photo][photo_cache]" id="review_review_photo_photo_cache"&gt;
            &lt;input class="file-input" data-action="photo-upload#test" data-target="photo-upload.photoUploadInput" type="file" name="review[review_photo][photo]" id="review_review_photo_photo"&gt;
          &lt;span class="file-cta"&gt;
            &lt;span class="file-icon"&gt;
              &lt;i class="fas fa-upload"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="file-label"&gt;
              Choose a file‚Ä¶
            &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="file-name hidden" data-target="photo-upload.fileName"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Controller:

    import { Controller } from "stimulus"
    
    export default class extends Controller {
    
      static targets = ["photoUploadInput", "fileName"]
    
      connect() {
        console.log(`${this.controllerName} connected.`)
      }
    
      test() {
        console.log("why am I not reaching here???")
      }
    }

EDIT: RESOLVED
