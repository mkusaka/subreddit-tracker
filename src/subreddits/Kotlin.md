On Flutter sites, they are talking like it's just a matter of time before Flutter kills Kotlin.   I know nothing about Dart, but I have been playing around with Kotlin and I love it.  So I'm hoping that Kotlin stays viable.  What does this sub think of the flutter movement?

If you have something like this:

    val a = A() // where A is a constructor
    a.b = "c"

Is it a bad idea? Should you use something like this?

    val a = A()
    a.setB("c")
