Hey guys, Im currently searching for freelancing opportunities using Rails. Opportunities are pretty less frequent than other frameworks on big stations like UpWork. Is there any websites, subreddits, etc..that concentrates on Rails freelancing opportunities?

Hi everyone,

More Ruby on Rails live-streaming this week, thanks to everyone that's watched over the last few weeks - hopefully this is useful or interesting to learners. I'm afraid I was running behind today, so didn't get a chance to post a link before the stream, so here's the link from earlier:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSngfjNKS0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWSngfjNKS0)

Here's the YouTube description of what's in the stream, as well as the chapter links (chapter's now appear in the YouTube video scrubber itself, which is neat).  


&gt;This week we went down a minor rabbit-hole with Tailwind CSS (totally my fault, I didn't research it enough and it's more different from the UI libraries I'm used to than I realised, I'll try and do some research during the week!).  We also built some initial edit and update controller actions for our Channel model and started looking at how we might allow admins to edit attributes on a Channel that a standard user can't edit. This comes from seeing this question in multiple places, so I was interested to raise it early.

Hi everyone,

What is the best approach to create a user to user chat app using action cable? 

There are tons of guides out there using chat rooms instead of usernames to create chats. 

I want to create this chat app so users can message each other as long as they know each other's usernames. Wickr like but without encryption lol.

I also need to add a feature to block users. Is it ideal to use devise authentication to achieve this?

The challenge also asks me to keep logs of login and invalid login.

Any advice is appreciated.

 Have a great weekend guys.

Hi there. I'm wondering if there's a way to either hide the file on github, or stop it from being pushed or what the best way to hide that would be? Since it just shows the password under "default: &amp;default" after adding the username and password, anyone an see it. Is it necessary to hide this password in the first place? I'd greatly appreciate the help!

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/izbmit/sending_partials_over_javascript/
---
I'm trying to customize a rails scaffold so it doesnt go to a new page every time I want to edit or create a new resource. 

Right now what I'm doing is using stimulus to prevent default behavior of links, then fetch `e. target.href` to display the form partial within a bootstrap modal. I then use `remote: true` to send the forms w/ javascript and respond with the resource partial like `format.js { render partial: "partial", locals: { resource: @resource }, content_type: "text" } `. I respond with the resource partial because it gets added to the DOM with `insertAdjacentHTML`.

Now that works and all but it feels kinda hacked together and dirty. Is there a better way to do this?
## [10][uploading multiple images to s3 with presign endpoint using shrine and uppy](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/iz9ux5/uploading_multiple_images_to_s3_with_presign/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/iz9ux5/uploading_multiple_images_to_s3_with_presign/
---
Sorry in advance for the overly broad question, but this isn't about bugs so much as it is about architecture and confusion brought on by trying to twist two docs into one objective. My hope is that someone could help untangle my brain.

I would like to: upload (to s3) and process multiple images using Shrine and Uppy with a nested form in Rails.

However, what I am getting is a POST request that only creates a parent. The child `photos` are neither uploaded to s3 nor saved to the database.

`Processing by ItemsController#create as HTML`

`Parameters: {"utf8"=&gt;"✓", "authenticity_token"=&gt;"[FILTERED]", "files"=&gt;[#&lt;ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f9cbc59a050 u/tempfile=#&lt;Tempfile:/var/folders/hj/g_90jx_n7s58m73qlf9h0c4w0000gn/T/RackMultipart20200924-5853-1pb0sdf.jpg&gt;, u/original_filename="in.jpg", u/content_type="image/jpeg", u/headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"files[]\"; filename=\"in.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n"&gt;], "item"=&gt;{"title"=&gt;"dip", "price"=&gt;"900"}, "commit"=&gt;"Submit"}`

`Item Create (10.1ms) INSERT INTO "items" ("created_at", "updated_at", "title", "price", "user_id") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) RETURNING "id" [["created_at", "2020-09-24 22:04:41.333195"], ["updated_at", "2020-09-24 22:04:41.333195"], ["title", "dip"], ["price", 900], ["user_id", 1]]`

The Shrine docs for [multiple uploads](https://shrinerb.com/docs/multiple-files#4b-direct-upload) suggest a model, controller, and view structure that looks like this:

**Models**

    class Photo &lt; ApplicationRecord
     include ImagesUploader::Attachment(:image)
     belongs_to :item
     validates_presence_of :image
    end
    
    class Item &lt; ApplicationRecord
     has_many :photos, dependent: :destroy
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :photos, allow_destroy: true
    end

**Controller**

    class ItemsController &lt; ApplicationController
     def create
      @item = Item.create(item_params)
      @item.save
     end
    
     private
     def item_params
      params.require(:item).permit(:title, photos_attributes: { image: [] })
     end
    end

**View**

    &lt;%= form_for @item, html: { enctype: "multipart/form-data" } do |f| %&gt;
     &lt;%= f.text_field :title %&gt;
     &lt;%= f.fields_for :photos do |i| %&gt;
      &lt;%= i.label :image %&gt;
      &lt;%= i.hidden_field :image, value: i.object.cached_photos_data, class: "upload-data" %&gt;
      &lt;%= i.file_field :image, class: "upload-file" %&gt;
     &lt;% end %&gt;
     &lt;%= file_field_tag "files[]", multiple: true %&gt;
     &lt;%= f.submit "Submit" %&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;

Ignoring my confusion over how this double `file_field/file_field_tag` works (and why I only see the latter), I go to [this github wiki](https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/wiki/Adding-Direct-S3-Uploads) to set up the presign endpoint with an initializer and a route:

**shrine.rb**

    require "shrine"
    require "shrine/storage/file_system"
    require "shrine/storage/s3"
    
    Shrine.plugin :presign_endpoint, presign_options: -&gt; (request) {
      filename = request.params["filename"]
      type     = request.params["type"]
    
      {
        content_disposition:    ContentDisposition.inline(filename), 
        content_type:           type,                                
        content_length_range:   0..(5*1024*1024),                  
      }
    }
    
    Shrine.plugin :activerecord
    Shrine.plugin :cached_attachment_data
    Shrine.plugin :restore_cached_data
    Shrine.plugin :validation
    Shrine.plugin :validation_helpers
    Shrine.plugin :determine_mime_type, analyzer: :marcel
    Shrine.plugin :remove_invalid

**routes.rb**

    get 'presign/s3/params', to: 'presigns#image'

Moved response to a controller for authorization:

    class PresignsController &lt; InheritedResources::Base
     before_action :authenticate_user!
    
     def image
      set_rack_response ImagesUploader.presign_response(:cache, request.env)
     end
    
     private
     def set_rack_response((status, headers, body))
      self.status = status
      self.headers.merge!(headers)
      self.response_body = body
     end
    end

To confirm that this is set up correctly, I visit `/presign/s3/params?filename=test&amp;type=jpg` and see JSON and my AWS credentials in the browser. Although the browser tab says `ActionController: Exception caught`, it seems to work as expected.

Thinking I'm good, I add the uploader and the javascript for handling direct uploads:

**uploader**

    class ImagesUploader &lt; Shrine
      require "image_processing/mini_magick"
      plugin :pretty_location
      plugin :derivatives
    
      s3 = { 
       bucket: ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME'],
       region: ENV['AWS_REGION'],
       access_key_id: ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
       secret_access_key: ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
      }
      Shrine.storages = { 
       cache: Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "cache", **s3), 
       store: Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "store", **s3)
      }
    
      Attacher.validate do
       validate_min_size	10.kilobytes	
       validate_max_size	5.megabytes, message: 'must be smaller than 5MB'
       validate_mime_type 	%w[image/jpeg image/png]
       validate_extension 	%w[jpg jpeg png]
      end
    
      Attacher.derivatives do |original|
       magick = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)
       {
    	large: magick.resize_to_limit!(1000, 1000),
    	small: magick.resize_and_pad!(225, 220)
       }
      end
    end

**app/javascript/fileUpload.js**

    import 'uppy/dist/uppy.min.css'
    
    import {

    function fileUpload(fileInput) {

            imagePreview = document.querySelector('.upload-preview img'),
            formGroup = fileInput.parentNode
    
      formGroup.removeChild(fileInput)
    
      const uppy = Core({
          autoProceed: true,
        })
        .use(FileInput, {
          target: formGroup,
        })
        .use(Informer, {
          target: formGroup,
        })
        .use(ProgressBar, {

        })
        .use(ThumbnailGenerator, {

        })
        .use(AwsS3, {
          companionUrl: '/presign/s3/params', // i set this to my presign endpoint, which I checked by visting site.com/presign/s3/params?filename=test&amp;type=jpg
        })
    
      uppy.on('thumbnail:generated', (file, preview) =&gt; {
        imagePreview.src = preview
      })
    
      uppy.on('upload-success', (file, response) =&gt; {
        const uploadedFileData = {
          id: file.meta['key'].match(/^cache\/(.+)/)[1],
          storage: 'cache',
          metadata: {
            size: file.size,
            filename: file.name,
            mime_type: file.type,
          }
        }
    
        hiddenInput.value = JSON.stringify(uploadedFileData)
      })
    }
    
    export default fileUpload

**javascript/packs/application.js**

    import fileUpload from 'fileUpload'
    
    document.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', () =&gt; {
      document.querySelectorAll('.upload-file').forEach(fileInput =&gt; {
        fileUpload(fileInput)
      })
    })

Some questions.

1. How does that double `file_field` work and why is it that the stray `file_field_tag` is the one that submits the files? I do not intuitively grasp how the two are connected. If the tag is named `files[]`, shouldn't my whitelisted params be something like `photos_attributes: { files: [] }`?
2. If uppy and shrine upload the files to an s3 cache, how do I get that information into my controller? Presumably I would get a JSON response. The doc has this to say, but I'm confused by what it means:

&gt;Once files are uploaded asynchronously, you can dynamically insert photo attachment fields for the `image` attachment attribute into the form, where the hidden field is filled with uploaded file data in JSON format, just like when doing single direct uploads. The attachment field names should be namespaced according to the convention that the nested attributes feature expects. In this case it should be `album[photos_attributes][&lt;uid&gt;]`, where `&lt;uid&gt;` is any unique string.

Is it possible to use AJAX to auto-save the form that's currently in view, but leave the default submit button active?  


I'm using wicked, and I have a fairly large form that needed to be sliced into pieces. Now, I want to save each individual form step with autosave using a timed function. Is it possible?
