We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey, I want to introduce a ui builder for different React UI libraries. If you have a cool React component library in mind, please add them to the builder platform.

In react if you want to render nothing either you can return null from the component or you can also render an empty fragment. I tried searching react docs and it suggests to use null. I also found this PR link where the support of returning empty Fragments was also fixed.  
[https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12964](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12964)

Is there any disadvantage of using &lt;React.Fragment/&gt; over null.

What do you guys think?

Hey React Community, I am a big fan of CRA but I'm having a lot of trouble setting it up in yarn workspace + lerna type monorepo, the structure is something like this:

```
(project root)
    /frontend/
       (cra stuff here)
    /server/
       - package.json
    /shared/
       - package.json
    lerna.json
    package.json
```

I've initialized CRA in frontend, What I expected was when I do npm start in frontend it would start the dev server at port 3000 as usual. but it starts in `localhost:4000/project root/frontend` and it doesn't work. 

Searching online I saw CRA has a lot of problem with yarn workspaces so I tried to override existing react scripts with craco or react-app-rewired but no luck so far

Any help would be appreciated, thanks

Hi All,
I am Learning React, along the way I am trying create a billing app.
My requirement is to search product through search field in table row and fill the other columns with the product details. 
If I search for the different product  for the same row, that needs to be updated in that particular row.
But quantity and per-Price columns are not updating.
I don't know how to approach this.
Please guide me in choosing a good approach for this.

this is the demo link for what I am talking about: https://lt7rh.csb.app/

So I recently started with react so this might be so obvious but I've been cracking my head for last two days.

I am using react material ui library , precisely collapsible table for displaying my data.  I cant figure out how/when and where to format  response from api so that table accepts it.

In docs they have [this function](https://imgur.com/a/h61Mf2C) that formats data, but when i dispatch action ([my reducer and actions](https://imgur.com/a/JkZendq)) it renders first time and selector gets value of undefined and it crushes my app.

Not the best explanation I know I can try to elaborate in comments . Any help is welcome

Hello, 

I'm having a little difficulty with part 2.1 "countries" exercise of the Full Stack Open course.  Here's a link to the page: [https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting\_data\_from\_server](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server)

The task is as follows:  "The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field." which I've managed to do. 

However I'm stuck on this part:

*"When there is only one country matching the query, then the basic data of the country, its flag and the languages spoken there"*

But I'm not sure how to change the code to do this! I feel a little ashamed on how basic this is - I've got this far and it has stumped me. 

Here's the link to what's been rendered to the page: [https://imgur.com/a/tXJIWFf](https://imgur.com/a/tXJIWFf)

Here's the code: 

`import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'`  
`import axios from 'axios'`  
`const App = () =&gt; {`  
 `const [countries, setCountries] = useState([])`  
 `const [searchFilter, setSearchFilter] = useState('')`  
 `useEffect(() =&gt; {`  
 `axios`  
`.get('https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all')`  
`.then(response =&gt; {`  
 `setCountries(response.data)`  
`})`  
  `}, [])`  
 `const filteredCountries =`  
 `searchFilter.length === 1`  
`? countries`  
`: countries.filter(`  
`(country) =&gt; country.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchFilter.toLowerCase()) &gt; -1`  
`)`  
 `const showCountries = () =&gt; {`  
 `if (filteredCountries.length &gt; 10) {`  
 `return 'Too many matches'`  
`}`  
 `return filteredCountries.map((country) =&gt;`  
 `&lt;p key={country.alpha2Code}&gt;{country.name}&lt;/p&gt;`  
`)`  
  `}`  
 `const searchHandler = (e) =&gt; {`  
 `setSearchFilter(e.target.value)`  
  `}`  
 `return (`  
 `&lt;div&gt;`  
 `&lt;h1&gt;Countries&lt;/h1&gt;`  
`find countries: &lt;input`  
 `onChange={searchHandler}`  
 `/&gt;`  
 `{showCountries()}`  
 `&lt;/div&gt;`  
  `)`  
`}`  
`export default App`
