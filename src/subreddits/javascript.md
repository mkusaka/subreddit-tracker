I've been looking to learn more JavaScript, couldn't find much resource online. Is there any resource you know that might help me learn it more? Of not, do you know any good book about the topic?

The name says it all.

This was my first project (and my first Github repo). I took my inspiration form coding train. I have implemented the basic sorting algorithms.

I would love get some **feedback** on how I can improve.

Thank you for your time.
