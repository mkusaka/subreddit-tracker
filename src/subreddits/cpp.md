**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

## [6][Member function forward declaration?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h8kjui/member_function_forward_declaration/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h8kjui/member_function_forward_declaration/

I've been looking into reducing compile times. I noticed files with just a few lines can spawn thousands  after preprocessing.

Many of those includes come to declare private members of classes being depended on. The pimpl idiom would be solution here, but I feel that is verbose and incur penalties that are not really needed.

I wrote what I thought to be a more elegant way to clean this up. But is it though?

    // Foo_fwd.hpp
    struct operator Foo // Invented "struct operator" syntax to represent
                        // a forward declaration with member functions
    {
        int as_int();
    };
    
    // User that just need the opaque interface of Foo
    // Very few dependencies - quick to compile
    int add(Foo&amp; f1, Foo&amp; f2) { return f1.as_int() + f2.as_int(); }
    
    
    // Foo.hpp
    // Actual member and inline function definition. Only here you get extra dependencies
    
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    struct Foo
    {
        void clear() { number_as_string.clear(); }
        std::string number_as_string;
    };
    
    
    // Foo.cpp
    int Foo::as_int()
    { 
        return std::stoi(number_as_string);
    }

So if you want to create, destroy or use inline member functions, you need to include \`Foo.h\`. Otherwise you could get by just including \`Foo\_fwd.h\`.

Pros: A lot of your code can just include the Foo\_fwd to use the class. Specially long lived classes that are created once and passed around.

Cons: The declaration of the class is a bit scattered.

More pros? More cons? Any other clean way to achieve this effect with the current language features?
## [7][Is there a special "compat" repository for windows shims](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h8sm8g/is_there_a_special_compat_repository_for_windows/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h8sm8g/is_there_a_special_compat_repository_for_windows/

Hello. I'm porting a C library for posix to support windows. The library uses posix specific things like unistd.h, pthread.h, etc.. I found some repos that use special "compat" shim that mimic behaviour of posix functionality and work with windows environment and msvc. Examples of such repos:  [https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable/tree/master/include/compat](https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable/tree/master/include/compat),  [https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/master/compat](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/master/compat)

Is there a specific compat repo that I can clone as submodule into my project? These guys find these sources somewhere or each writes their own shims?

Barbarian is a graphical frontend for the conan package manager. Conan is a package manager mainly aimed at devs. It's not a whole package, and conan has to be installed for it to work. It's written in the Qt framework. Please do check it out: [https://github.com/Roidujeu/barbarian](https://github.com/Roidujeu/barbarian)

 It's only available for unix-like OSes and not Windows(sorry). 

Arch users can install it from AUR: [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/barbarian/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/barbarian/) Please give me your feedback too so that i can improve it.
