I took some quarantine downtime to make something silly: [https://blepper.andrewray.me/](https://blepper.andrewray.me/)

Tech stack: This is built using react, react-spring, and the awesome [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) library, which glues imperative Threejs code to declarative react code. The model was hand traced in Blender from a photo, and loaded using GLTF. For fun I built a local development setup using Nextjs and Docker. Nextjs gave me hot reloading in my dev environment, code splitting, and static site generation.

If you've been on the internet long enough, you probably know the gif that inspired this site.
## [5][How to develop infinite scroll with React. Explanation and tested implementation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/futg5v/how_to_develop_infinite_scroll_with_react/)

Hi guys! I hope you're all doing well.

A couple of days ago, I decided to implement a React app with an infinite scroll. I ended up writing an [article](https://joaoforja.com/blog/how-to-implement-infinite-scroll-in-react/) that goes over the implementation and the thought process I used.

Although the article doesn't go over how to test the implementation, you can check this [repository](https://github.com/Jnforja/infinite-scroll-react-app) to see the tests I ended up doing.

I hope you find this interesting and let me know if you have any questions :)

TL;DR: [link](https://ldd.github.io/react-tech-tree/#examples) | [code](https://github.com/ldd/react-tech-tree) MIT licensed

A couple of years ago I made tech-trees [using d3](https://github.com/ldd/tech-tree-js). I wanted to revisit the project, so I remade tech tree as composable React Components.

Please take a look at the examples. They are interactable and I hope people can suggest new features or find bugs.

I'll also try to actually procedurally generate the data for these in the future.

Hello,

I am new to the React Context API. How can I use multiple contexts in a Component (I use class components)?

One Context works perfectly with that code:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

`import React, { Component } from "react";`

`import { ContextA } from "../contexts/ContextA";`

&amp;#x200B;

`class MyClass extends Component {`

  `constructor() {`

`super();`

  `}`

&amp;#x200B;

  `componentDidMount() {`

&amp;#x200B;

  `}`

&amp;#x200B;

  `render() {`

`return (`

		`&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;`

	`);`

  `}`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

`MyClass.contextType = RoundContext;`

`export default Bracket;`

I have started to only use redux inside any component via a custom hook. It started as an experiment, but I am quite enamored with the approach, not only does it completely encapsulate redux making it easy to swapping it for another state management library, but it also much more lightweight to connect a component:

Here is an example of such a hook to get a specific book and its update action from the store:[https://gist.github.com/JanBussieck/b58d604691d89c98524a109719c0605c](https://gist.github.com/JanBussieck/b58d604691d89c98524a109719c0605c)

I was  wondering what people here thought of this approach and what some potential downsides may be.

I have outlined my approach in more detail here [https://www.bussieck.com/decouple-from-redux-using-hooks/](https://www.bussieck.com/decouple-from-redux-using-hooks/)

Thanks!

Hey i was trying to implement this basic `HTML` and `Js` code into my react:

    &lt;select id="country"&gt;
        &lt;option data-countryCode="IN" value="91" selected&gt;India&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option data-countryCode="US" value="1"&gt;US&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option data-countryCode="GB" value="44"&gt;UK&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    
    &lt;input type="tel" placeholder ="956 826 4457" id="tel"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      const select = document.querySelector('#country');
    const tel = document.getElementById('tel');
    let prevVal = select.value; // storing previous value of select
    
    // this block will be exected on init of code
    if(tel.value) tel.value = `${select.value}${tel.value}`;
    else tel.placeholder = `${select.value}${tel.placeholder}`;
    
    // adding event on changing input
    tel.addEventListener('change', ({ target }) =&gt; {
      const reg = new RegExp(`(^${prevVal} )`);
      // checking do we already have country code
      if (reg.test(target.value)) tel.value = tel.value.replace(reg, target.value);
      else tel.value = `${select.value}${target.value}`;
    });
    
    // adding event on changing select
    select.addEventListener('change', ({ target }) =&gt; {
      const reg = new RegExp(`(^${prevVal})`);
      if(tel.value) tel.value = `${target.value}${tel.value.replace(reg, '')}`;
      else tel.placeholder =  tel.placeholder.replace(reg, target.value);
      prevVal = target.value;
    });
    
    &lt;/script&gt;

as per the following:

    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import './component_style/telinput.css';
    export class telinput extends Component {
        render() {
             const selectCountryChange = ({target}) =&gt; {
            const img = document.querySelector('#img');
            const select = document.querySelector('#country');
            const tel = document.getElementById('tel');
    
            let prevVal = select.value; 
    
            if(tel.value) tel.value = `${select.value}${tel.value}`;
            else tel.placeholder = `${select.value}${tel.placeholder}`;
    
    
            const reg = new RegExp(`(^${prevVal} )`);
            if (reg.test(target.value)) tel.value = tel.value.replace(reg, target.value);
            else tel.value = `${select.value}${target.value}`;
    
    
    
    
            if(tel.value) tel.value = `${target.value}${tel.value.replace(reg, '')}`;
            else tel.placeholder =  tel.placeholder.replace(reg, target.value);
            prevVal = target.value;
    
    
            img.src = `https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/h80/${this.selectedOptions[0].dataset.countrycode.toLowerCase()}.webp`
    
    
        }
    
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;div className="tel-input"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div className="input-box"&gt;

                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    }
    
    export default telinput;

but i got this error:

    TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
    selectCountryChange
    C:/Users/Rahul/Desktop/collegefacemash/src/form/components/telinput.js:20
      17 |      else tel.placeholder = tel.placeholder.replace(reg, target.value);

         | ^  21 |  };
      22 | 
      23 |  return (

I really didn't understand that why such error occurred in react whereas when the selectedOptions\[0\] is the native JavaScript property and should work well.

can anyone tell me what should I do to correct this Thanks...

```javascript

onMouseLeave={() =&gt; setOpen(false)}
```
I recon that if I write a custom hook with `useRef()` I would be able to reuse that in other elements while this is just for the element it's written into. Thoughts please...

Did someone measured development time using React and Vue? I like React's features to optimize an app performance (worrying about unnecessary re-renders) and flexibility, but i often find myself writing web-apps in Vue much quicker, i have equal experience in Vue and React (\~1 year in both).
