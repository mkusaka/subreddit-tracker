We’ll be joined by other developers and team leads from Kotlin, as well as two special guests: Wojtek Kaliciński /u/wkalicinski from Google and Sebastien Deleuze /u/sdeleuze from Spring.

On October 12–15 we hosted the Kotlin 1.4 Online Event, and over the course of those four days we received many interesting questions. Since we did not manage to cover all of them due to time constraints, we will answer them in a specific thread under this post.

Please post your questions as top-level comments to this post.

We look forward to hearing from you!

ok.. few problems....

While i was making some test apps, as usual, for every app there was a folder created (such as com.example.asdf) in Internal memory. But I noticed that for one app when i connect phone to pc, i cant find that app's folder (but i see all the others)... but i can find it when i use File manager directly in the phone. I already turned on option "Show hidden files and folders" on my pc.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if the issue is because in that test app I am creating some subfolders and some files.

This is the code which is making a new folder and file. It works but do you think that this might be the reason for app's folder to be hidden on PC?

In any case... I would like a help how to set attributes to the newly created folder and file. Those attributes like: Read only, Hidden, Archive...

...but I would like a help how to set file without any restrictions: Not hidden, Read + Write,...

    val fNewFile: File?
    fNewFile = File(getExternalFilesDir("MyFolder"),"MyFile.txt")
    
    val fNewFileExists= fNewFile.exists()
    if(!fNewFileExists)
    {
      // if File "MyFile.txt" doesn't exist then make it
    
      val fileData = "asdfasdfasdfasdf"
    
      try {
        val fileOutPutStream = FileOutputStream(fNewFile)
    
        fileOutPutStream.write(fileData.toByteArray())
        fileOutPutStream.close()
      } catch (e: IOException) {
        Toast.makeText(applicationContext,"Error...",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        e.printStackTrace()
      }
    }

Second problem, and this one is QUITE HUGE problem for me. By using the same code my app makes some txt files, names of files are given by user in that moment. My code works.. but i have some weird problem.  If there are created files... a.txt, b.txt, c.txt... when i uninstall the app, those files should be deleted, yes? But when i uninstall the app, and then install it again, again i can see a.txt, b.txt, c.txt files.

Even when I manually delete them in File Manager, uninstall the app, install the app, they are back again.

Even crazier is that now if i create some new file..like... "test.txt" and then i reinstall the app... I will see those files "a.txt, b.txt, c.txt", but i will not see file "test.txt"

Even when I go to Settings/Apps/MyApp/Storage and there I click \[Clear data\] and \[Clear cache\], it shows in File manager that everything is deleted. Hahaha but again.. i reinstall the app... and all those files "a.txt, b.txt, c.txt" are back

Any help? :)))

Hi,

I am looking for a library that will map the result of my queries to Kotlin objects.

ORMLite comes close but has some problems with raw queries and Dates.

I just need the mapping, none of the DSL, etc.

Any ideas?
