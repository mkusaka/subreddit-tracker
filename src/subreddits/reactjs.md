Hi all, my buddy and I built a crypto focused social media site with React JS. The frontend was done with React JS and our backend was done with Go/MongoDB. Check it out if you'd like and give me any feedback or questions you have.

[https://github.com/daveidivide/mortgage-payment-calculator](https://github.com/daveidivide/mortgage-payment-calculator)

This is my first project using React.

I'm in the middle of buying and selling a home and wanted an interactive tool to show me the finances over the term of the mortgage.

Something I'm considering adding next is an overpayments calculator to see how much you can save over the term by paying less interest.

I likely won't though as it's just more maths and I'd rather do something which is more React focused.

Any feedback welcome!

**Things I've learned:**

* React class components
* React component lifecycle methods
* Functional components
* React hooks with functional components
 * useState()
 * useEffect()
* Stateful components being updated by their stateless child components
* Create React App
* How much money the banks make

I¬¥m starting a new project in a new company, and we are still debating this. Some people want to use Redux, but I want to use Context (or Contexts) to share only state that¬¥s truly global (user auth, that sort of thing) and then handle everything else locally in whichever component is necessary. What do you guys use currently?

I built a generic, reusable landing page in React. The goal was to build something extremely quick and simple to get feedback and validate your next product idea.

Here is a [live demo](http://react-landing-page1.herokuapp.com/) and the [source code with a guide](https://github.com/jonathancai11/react-landing-page) on how to set it up for yourself and deploy on Heroku in less than 5 minutes!

I'd love to hear thoughts :)

so here's the thing i took a 40+ hour course regarding MEN stack since i wanted to learn backend development first and made a few projects on it, on the other hand my friend is working on react, and we both want to make a project using both the frameworks. Since i dont know react i asked some fellow coders and they adviced me that i should know some react in order to work with it and implement node into the project, when i looked up for some courses on udemy i found a 40+ react course by maxmillian and a brad traversy's mern stack course which was only about 12hours so would it be worth purchasing the 40+ hour course over brad traversy's course since i dont want to waste much time

I have a technical take home test for a React job but I'm struggling to figure out the best solution. 

I have to take an image and be able to drag a rectangle with the mouse to mark the part of the image that should be exported as a detail shot. I have looked into using HTML canvas and I have some other ideas but nothing feels right. Has anyone got any ideas about a good way to solve this.

I'm new to Web Development and this is my first time trying to learn React. I am trying to learn from [this](https://youtu.be/DLX62G4lc44) video tutorial, using visual studio code as my ide for this, and the live server plugin to render the website. So far, its been blank and not rendering the contents of my function from index.js.

index.html -&gt;

 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;html lang="en"&gt;  
&lt;head&gt;  
 &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;  
 &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,¬†initial-scale=1.0"&gt;  
 &lt;title&gt;React-Js¬†Test&lt;/title&gt;  
 &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;  
&lt;/head&gt;  
&lt;body&gt;  
 &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  


 &lt;script src="index.pack.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  


&lt;/body&gt;  
&lt;/html&gt;  


style.css is an empty file.

index.js -&gt;

import React from "react"  
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"  
function MyInfo()  
{  
 return(  
 &lt;div&gt;  
 &lt;h1&gt;Name&lt;/h1&gt;  
 &lt;p&gt;lorem...&lt;/p&gt;  
 &lt;ul&gt;  
 &lt;li&gt;India&lt;/li&gt;  
 &lt;li&gt;USA&lt;/li&gt;  
 &lt;li&gt;Canada&lt;/li&gt;  
 &lt;/ul&gt;  
 &lt;/div&gt;  
);  
}  
ReactDOM.render(&lt;MyInfo /&gt;,¬†document.getElementById("root"));
