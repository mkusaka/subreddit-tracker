**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* 🚨 **Updated Remote section.** 🚨 You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [🚨 **Updated!** 🚨 Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I was looking at all these machine learning and computer vision libraries, and they are developed in C++ but you can use them in many other languages. I was wondering how do you make something like that.

I have read some stuff on it but it still confuses me, so if anyone has done something similar, I would appreciate the explanation.

Other than for backward compatibility reasons, what are the problems still need to be solved in order to completely get rid of these? I know that many of the recent features are geared toward this goal, but I also vaguely know that we still need macros and header files for reasons other than backward compatibility.
## [9][TIL: When unlocking any of the std::mutex(es), it must first be locked](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gowpvh/til_when_unlocking_any_of_the_stdmutexes_it_must/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gowpvh/til_when_unlocking_any_of_the_stdmutexes_it_must/
---
In most situations, it isn't a problem, but in some situations this might arise. Remember, you need to ensure you only call unlock after the mutex has been locked by the current thread. This was a surprise today when debugging some of my co-worker's code.

"The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution, **otherwise, the behavior is undefined**."

Source: [https://github.com/lionkor/String](https://github.com/lionkor/String)  
Documentation: [https://lionkor.github.io/String-docs](https://lionkor.github.io/String-docs)

I was always unsatisfied with  `std::string`, as it seems inconsistent with the rest of the STL and lacks a few major methods that I need almost every day, like a proper `replace`, `split`, `find` which returns iterators and so on. 

So I made `String`, including documentation of the entire public interface and unit tests, which does (almost) all the things I want it to do.

Currently on the roadmap are using something like `std::pmr::vector` instead of `std::vector`, maybe implementing SSO (I had it in version 1.0, but that was scrapped), and making the char type templated (or adding some other way of using `wchar` and such). 

I'd be super honored if I could get some feedback on it, from both a technical and convenience standpoint. 

(I am aware that it's slower than `std::string`, and I'm also aware of other string libraries and extensions for `std::string`. I don't find them more convenient than rolling my own implementation.)

Edit: It uses variadic templates for `String::format`, which for me personally is a huge win!

Edit2: I dont think my implementation is better than std::string. I don't know where that came from, but I know my implementation is shit. I've been programming C++ for a year, I dont think I write better code than STL devs. I like it better than std::string, its better for me personally. Thats all. I felt like it needed to be clarified before more people "call me out" on it.
