hey guys,

I'm a noob at ruby and just wondering why the following code doesn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

char\_name = "john"

char\_age = "40"

\#---------------------------Story Begins Here----------------------------------#

puts "this is a story"

puts ("all about "+char\_name+" who was "+char\_age+"")

puts (""+char\_name+" was "+char\_age+" and he liked apples")

puts ("because he was "+char\_age+" and his name was "+char\_name+" ")

puts "this is\\nmostly true"

phrase = "but who really knows?"

puts phrase

\#puts phrase.include? "?"

\#puts phrase \[15,20\]

\#-------------------------------New Chapter------------------------------------#

puts "hello #{char\_name}, are you here to buy apples?"

num\_apples = "#{1+3}"

num\_apples.gsub ("#{1+3}", "#{1+2}")

puts "yes i would like to buy #{num\_apples} apples please"

&amp;#x200B;

No error shows up but the last part with the variable num\_apples.gsub doesnt change the amount from 4 to 3. is there a different way i should be doing this or can this just not be used for numbers and math.

&amp;#x200B;

thank you for helping :)

The company I work for has the domain split between a few monoliths, each is its own Rails app with its own daabase. All of the apps depend on one monolith that handles users, roles and other things, let's call it UsersApp.

Now let's say you have BillingApp, and it needs to pull the data from UsersApp. For example forms in BullingApp need to have the user's data to show it in the form drop downs etc., what ways do you know of handling this issue and what are the tradeoffs? In our case the relationship is read only (BillingApp always reads and never writes), but I'd like to get a more general discussion going.

Just to help get a discussion going here are the ways I know of:

1. Using ActiveResource in BillingApp to access everything, or similar technique to just pull everything through an API that UsersApp exposes.
2. Pulling and syncing the data from UsersApp into BillingApp (basically duplicating the database tables in BillingApp). Let's say the data isn't time sensitive, the sync can happen once a day so "real timeness" isn't an issue here.
3. Packing UsersApp as a gem, and having BillingApp access the models/data directly.

## [4][.destroy Getting Killed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/f9ll24/destroy_getting_killed/)

I'm running into an issue where I have a model with many children (has\_many) relationships. 

When I call .destroy on this model, the process grows so large that it's getting killed.

I've tried overloading .destroy on that model and some of the associated model to use a `.each(&amp;:destroy)` where possible but that did not solve the issue.

Any suggestions on destroying a model where the associated models have 100k-1M rows?

## [6][Logging Accessible via Active Record](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/f9lizu/logging_accessible_via_active_record/)

Hey all! 

I'm looking to have logs written in a way that reads are accessible via Active Record but I'm not sure what the options are for this.

For example:  
`User.find(123).logs.first.lines.where(type: 'Info').where('message like ?', 'My Error Message')`

In short, I'd like to write logs to a standard SQL database, without the overhead of writing logs to a SQL database. (the Lines model includes +1M records)

I'm assuming this is possible but my Googling is coming up short. 

Can any recommend a technology, method of doing this or direction that I should be looking?

Thanks in advance!

## [10][Hate for Medium](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/f927ed/hate_for_medium/)

Several times, I've considered biting the bullet, putting my hand in my pocket, ponying up the $5, or whatever it is, for a Medium subscription. Some of the content is pretty good. I've enjoyed content by /u/mehdifarsi, /u/eric_programmer, /u/vfreefly and others in the past.

But, today, the top article in my *Medium Daily Digest* points me to \***medium link alert**\* - [Tracking User Streaks in Ruby](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tracking-user-streaks-in-ruby-a49e90ce46a1). If you don't want to follow that link, fair enough, but in it, the author presents a 14 line poorly formatted method containing errors (both syntactic and semantic) that purports to count user activity streaks.

Now, I don't want to hate on the author - if this post was on a personal blog or a free aggregation site, I'd be happy to comment with some positive constructive criticism - but for a service that pesters me regularly for $5 per month to deliver this kind of "Ideas and perspectives you wonâ€™t find anywhere else" from "the worldâ€™s most insightful writers, thinkers, and storytellers" and call it "the smartest takes on topics that matter" is an outright scam!

If this outfit is taking $5/month off what must be an awful lot of people, surely they can afford to pay some subject matter experts to do the most cursory of proof reading? Can't they?

Anyway, rant over. Happy Birthday Ruby ðŸŽ‚ ðŸŽ‰
