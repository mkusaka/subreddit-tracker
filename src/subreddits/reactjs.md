We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [3][Music Analyzer - MERN Stack Web app using the Spotify API](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ivotz2/music_analyzer_mern_stack_web_app_using_the/)

Hi everyone !

I want to share with you an interesting project I have been working on recently.

Spotify have an amazing API that anyone can use to get info about music from their repository.

 A very interesting feature that I was exposed to is called Audio Features, which contains metrics about the nature of the song. 

Like: denceability, how suitable a song is for dancing

 energy, how fast and noisy the song is.

An interesting idea that came to my mind is to use these parameters to compare the nature of the music of different artists according to their most famous song metrics.

I built a website that allows you to make the comparison and see the results on a graph.

 Link to website: [https://music-analyze.herokuapp.com/](https://music-analyze.herokuapp.com/)

 The project has been uploaded to GitHub, feel free to use it as you wish: [https://github.com/stavelmashally/music-analyzer](https://github.com/stavelmashally/music-analyzer) 

The project was built using React &amp; Node.js. 

I would love to receive suggestions for improvement or addition of additional features.

Hey everyone!

A few months ago, I [made a post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/gu38sc/help_how_long_have_you_been_selfstudying/) to understand how I could help others with their frontend journey. I've noticed that people have a hard time build projects, despite them being a really good way to improve technical skills.

I created a website ([https://www.codeaway.io/](https://www.codeaway.io/)) that provides frontend developers with [ready-to-go projects](https://www.codeaway.io/restaurant-recommendations) that they can use to practice their technical skills while they're on the job search or at their current role.

I'd appreciate your feedback on the website and any suggestions for projects/skills you'd want to work on!

Hello dear friends,

For the past 7 months I have been focusing on learning front-end web development. I have completed first 4 certificate programs on freecodecamp and watched some courses and tutorials on Udemy, Scrimba and Youtube.

Currently my tech stack is Javascript, React, HTML5, CSS, Sass (SCSS), Bootstrap, D3.js, Git. And I have some understanding of Redux, jQuery, BEM. And also some basic knowledge previously learnt in Python and SQL.

So I have created a [portfolio site](https://konstantinkrumin.github.io/#/) with all my front-end projects and hosted it on Github Pages. It is basically the main portfolio website that has links on separately deployed 16 projects that I have worked on (everything should be mobile friendly and work well on bigger resolution screens as well). All projects were built with React and using Create-React-App.

Could you please checkout my portfolio website and provide some feedback? Please let me know if you find any bugs or design issues.

And also based on what you see, could you tell me whether am I ready to start looking for a job as a junior developer or there are some things that you would recommend to work on (whether some other technology to learn or improve my knowledge in my current stack).

Deployed website: [konstantinkrumin.github.io](https://konstantinkrumin.github.io/#/)

My code and documentation: [github repository](https://github.com/konstantinkrumin/konstantinkrumin.github.io/tree/master)

Cheers,

Konstantin :)

After multiple tries to find a design or make the portfolio, like i had pictured in mind and on my paper sketches, i finally came through.

React only helped for routing and the component structure,but was familiar with the framework so, why not! 

Inspired by tons of dribbble shots and amazing dev portfolios seen here on other sites.

Check the source here  [https://github.com/rajatkulkarni95/portfolio-v3](https://github.com/rajatkulkarni95/portfolio-v3)

Let me know what you people think of it, and would recruiters find this good to give me a call back!!
## [12][Is react-query needed when using Firestore realtime updates?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ivqlg6/is_reactquery_needed_when_using_firestore/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ivqlg6/is_reactquery_needed_when_using_firestore/

In the past I have used Firestore realtime updates along with Redux but lately I've been convinced that I've been putting too much server state into my redux store, which I agree with. Therefore, I decided to try out `react-query` which looks amazing but I don't think it makes sense to use with realtime updates. It seems perfect for apps which use a traditional REST endpoint to prevent unnecessary calls and the caching mechanism is genius to allow you to use hooks to replace storing your remote state along with client state.

&amp;nbsp;

In my app I simply have a few "todo like" lists which users can add, edit and remove from. I store this data in Firestore and with the Firestore realtime updates I get instant updates when something changes, no need to re-fetch. Therefore, I was wondering if I should just set up these realtime subscriptions in a higher level component and use the Context API  to share the data with child components?
