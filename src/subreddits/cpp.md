**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

## [3][Friend, private function, template alias, and decltypeâ€¦ is clang correct in rejecting this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gc54yi/friend_private_function_template_alias_and/)

*Disclaimer: this is a question I submitted to Stack Overflow a week ago [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/61410959/147192), and for which I am surprised not to have received any answer yet.*

The following code compiles with GCC 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x, but fails to compile with Clang:

    #include &lt;utility&gt;

    struct Friend {
        class Inner {
            friend struct Friend;

            int function() { return 0; }
        };

        using DirectResult = decltype(std::declval&lt;Inner&gt;().function());

        template &lt;typename T&gt;
        using IndirectResult = decltype(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().function());
    };

    int main() {
        Friend::DirectResult direct{};
        Friend::IndirectResult&lt;Friend::Inner&gt; indirect{};
        return direct + indirect;
    }

You can view the failure [on godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/uy-zVs):

    &lt;source&gt;:13:55: error: 'function' is a private member of 'Friend::Inner'    
        using IndirectResult = decltype(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().function());
                                                          ^
    &lt;source&gt;:18:13: note: in instantiation of template type alias 'IndirectResult' requested here
        Friend::IndirectResult&lt;Friend::Inner&gt; indirect{};
                ^

Clang does not complain about `DirectResult` accessing the privates of `Inner`, but complains about `IndirectResult` doing so. Various variations lead to different results.

It was brought to my attention that this seems similar to [this Clang bug](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25334), filed 5 years ago, and still unanswered.

As a result, I still haven't figured out whether my code is **correct or not** according to the standard, and I would appreciate help in elucidating this mystery.

Hello fellow Computer Scientists,  


I need some insights, pseudocode, or general help with my algorithm for making a competition for a football league. For example Premier League. Every week clubs play each other. I am responsible for making an algorithm that succesfully makes a roster for all these clubs so that every club plays each other once, and every club plays the same amount of homegames and outgames.  


It also has a few constrains that for example 2 clubs that come from the same city aren't allowed to play 2 homegames in the same week. For example Manchester City and Manchester United aren't allowed to play 2 home-games in Week 7. I have to take this into account in my algorithm.  


The algorithm should be a backtracking algorithm. Anyone wants to help me out a bit? I have started but I think I'm doing it way to complicated.

## [10][Bug in Clang &amp; MSVC regarding initializer_list](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gbntov/bug_in_clang_msvc_regarding_initializer_list/)

Original thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp\_questions/comments/gbjikq/a\_piece\_of\_code\_is\_accepted\_by\_clang\_but\_not\_by](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/gbjikq/a_piece_of_code_is_accepted_by_clang_but_not_by)

I now played around a bit with the code and it looks like that Clang and MSVC don't select the right constructor when using braced initialization lists with non-aggregates (see code below).

But this also makes me wonder how can it be that there is such a bug in the first place. initializer\_list has been around for a good while and the code below should be rather common based on the assumption that people actually use initializer\_list and braced init lists. I'm curious, do you use std::intializer\_list in your APIs? Are you satisfied with this feature?

I don't use it. Tried it once it became available and never found a use case that would give initializer\_list enough relevance to incorporate it in an API. As for the second question: No idea as I don't really use it. The rules surrounding it are at least quirky I find.

    using namespace std;
    
    struct foo
    {
        template&lt;class F&gt;
        foo(F f)
        {
            /*
            Aggregates copy/move initialize directly from single-element
            braced-init-lists of the same type, but non-aggregates consider
            initializer_list constructors first.
            
            So the compiler should fail here.
            */
            static_assert(!is_same&lt;F,vector&lt;foo&gt;&gt;::value);
        }
