*Sorry for reposting, buit my first attempt has been deleted after two days... Here we go again:*

It is a website with information given only in german so it makes sense I guess. The topic is about web accessibility and I would appreciate it if a lot of diverse people would test the page (of course this can't be forced lol).

Btw. The website is created with React and the Material UI library was being used.

This the procedure of your testing:

Link to website:

And this is the survey:

[https://forms.gle/3U4ptLWaviRqUDmFA](https://forms.gle/3U4ptLWaviRqUDmFA)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pls read the procedure first.**

If you have any suggestion where I can post my request, too, to gain as many people as possible regarding the topic accessibility on the web, would be really helpful!

In [2017](https://varun.ca/convergence) I noticed that most major frameworks adopted the component construct. Tom Coleman in his post ‚Äú[Component-Driven Development](https://blog.hichroma.com/component-driven-development-ce1109d56c8e)‚Äù, described this modular UI trend. That said, I‚Äôm still amazed how fast components have take over UIs. Especially on the web.

It makes sense why. Building UIs is hard. Users expect compelling and personalized experiences, which require a lot of UI logic. But managing that complexity is tricky without simplifying it in a modular way. That‚Äôs where components come in.

With this shift, countless frontend, design, documentation, and testing tools adopted a component-driven model. Breaking down complex UIs into simple components makes it easier to build UIs.

To capture this shift, I started collecting a list of tools and the latest thinking on component driven UIs. I gathered all of these resources in one place, to give you an overview:

* üìö Glossary &amp; guides
* üõ† Frontend tools
* üé® Design tools
* üì¶ Component Story Format (common standard for interoperability)

Hi guys, let me start saying that this is a React Native question.

So, I will be freelancing for a old company I worked for, improving/refactoring an old app I made for them when I worked there.

The app is related to farmers jobs, so its important that has offline capabilities, as there can be situations where the user will not have access to internet, but he still has to be able to introduce new data.

In Spain, where I'm based, farmers usually don't own a big chunk of land, but small separated chunks, so there is a lot of data related to coordinates.

\- Store all critic data (Plot lands, Workers, Chemical Products, Machinery) used to create job tasks, analitics etc...  in the device when the user logs in for first time. AsyncStorage?

\- Use this data all around the app, Redux? React Context? Once the app starts hydrate this provider with all the data stored in async storage, and also refresh it in both places if it fetches new data when it needs it in other screens. 

\- How to deal with errors because no internet connection, if an user add a new job task, and there is no internet, where do you hold this data, how do you present it, and also, instead of adding, what if they update some that already exists and it fails. This is where I doubt more, how to approach this, so its not a big mess, and its escalable and efficient. 

This is some of the libraries that I will be using when it comes to architecture design:

\- Redux with redux-thunk so I can trigger async petitions? Or its over engineering and I just go for React Context.

\- useSWR for data fetching and catching, I think this is a must. 

\- AsyncStorage to store the data.

Do you recommend some library to work with big arrays of objects and mutate them easily with something like, mutate(idOfObjectInArray) or something like this?
