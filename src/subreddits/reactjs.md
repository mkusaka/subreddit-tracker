We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi All,

I created [blueprintstack.io](https://blueprintstack.io) a couple of days ago for new people to experiment with the API blueprint spec ([https://apiblueprint.org/](https://apiblueprint.org/)).

Features:

1. No account required
2. Multiple blueprint files
3. Automatic preview updates (while typing)
4. Blueprints saved locally (indexedDB)

The site was created using Next.js and the source is available here: [https://github.com/alexalikiotis/blueprintstack](https://github.com/alexalikiotis/blueprintstack)

Let me know if you've any feedback or questions, have a nice day!

Iâ€™m looking for a Figma Design System Component Library that is supported directly by a library of React Components. [Ant for Figma](https://antforfigma.com) and [Set Product](https://setproduct.com/desktop/react) appear to possibly fit that description. Has anyone used these tools, or anything else that might provide a solution? Thanks!

I was wondering how React behaves or is efficient for applications with large content, eg in content editable div or textarea.
If the data is maintained with immutability, would the huge data copy be replaced for every character added to the content?
How would one approach design of some application with huge content in react ?

*"I really like it but can I use postgres instead of mongoDB?"*

Last time I shared Papyr, this was one of the first and highest rated responses I got. At the time, the answer was that only Mongo DB was supported, but then I got to work! Leveraging the [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) ORMs, Papyr now supports any databases that these ORMs support (including Postgres).

Maybe you weren't here last time I introduced Papyr. Papyr CMS is something of a CMS/Framework hybrid. Using the NextJS React framework, Papyr is designed to be extremely customizable (the CMS part) and extendable (the Framework part). Using a combination of "Content Posts" and "Page Posts", which leverage a series of pre-built Sections, custom landing pages fly together (check out [how it works](https://papyrcms.com/posts/content-and-page-building)). Because, however, Papyr is built on NextJS, developers can customize their install to their heart's content. Additional Sections can be added to the "components/sections" directory of a project to be included in the list of sections used to build pages, or, using NextJS's "pages" routing, one can simply build their own React component in the "pages" directory that can be as custom and advanced as it needs to be.

Besides being a customizable CMS and extendable Framework, Papyr comes with all sorts of functionality that most websites need already baked in. These features include blog, events, ecommerce, quick website initialization, user authentication, Gmail integration,Â Google Analytics, and more! On top of that, Papyr is designed to be used for free! Every service (hosting, database, image storage, etc) is a "freemium" service, so everything can be used for free, but is very easy to scale for a few dollars once you need to.

Check out the home website at [https://papyrcms.com](https://papyrcms.com/)Â or the code at [https://github.com/drkgrntt/papyr-cms](https://github.com/drkgrntt/papyr-cms). You can also see a demo site showcasing many of the front-end features using fake content at [https://drkgrntt.herokuapp.com](https://drkgrntt.herokuapp.com/).

Do you have any questions or comments? Feature requests? Bug reports? Would you like to contribute? Please feel free to reach out in any way you know now, or via the [contact form](https://papyrcms.com/contact), and I will get back with you as soon as I can.

Thanks for reading!
## [9][Frontend React js and backend spring boot multiple page application.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/igu5y0/frontend_react_js_and_backend_spring_boot/)

Need help,

I have multiple page front end application on React js and backend on spring boot. I'm able to communicate between them when I run them separately but when I include react application inside spring boot, I am able to access only main page, on navigation to other pages I land on "White lable error page" provided by spring boot with no message found.

For creating I used reference as below post: https://medium.com/@mukundmadhav/build-and-deploy-react-app-with-spring-boot-and-mysql-6f888eb0c600

Hello folks,

I have learned almost everything I know about React and its ecosystem of tools from documentation, courses etc even though I have a master's degree. Now I feel like I want to give back to the community so wanted to know what steps should I take to contribute towards open source software? I have written a few blog posts on topics like Redux ([https://codeburst.io/redux-a-crud-example-abb834d763c9](https://codeburst.io/redux-a-crud-example-abb834d763c9))and Redux Thunk ([https://codeburst.io/understanding-redux-thunk-6dbae0241817](https://codeburst.io/understanding-redux-thunk-6dbae0241817)). Not sure if that counts but yes I would like to contribute more towards open source projects. Just that whenever I open a project that I feel like I want to contribute I kinda get overwhelmed initially not sure if that happens to everyone maybe its just me. So I am mainly looking for a good starting point that is not too complicated enough but atleast a start

Thanks

        return age
    }

    }
