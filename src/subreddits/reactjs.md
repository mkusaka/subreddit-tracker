## [7][Is there a reason React &amp; Django are not commonly used together? Should I avoid this combination? What are the pros and cons?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iqeijm/is_there_a_reason_react_django_are_not_commonly/)

Django seems like the best backend framework for what I want ( a post feed type application ) and react seems the best for what I want as far as hot reloads on the frontend. I also know both well. However, I am not seeing too much love for the combination...
## [8][Security question about user authentication](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iqme1e/security_question_about_user_authentication/)

I've setup my app with nextjs + express server + passport.js. Users can signup and login with email+password combo. After user is logged in i can check user info like this:

    static async getInitialProps({ req, query }) {
        const userAgent = req
          ? req.user
          : null;
        return userAgent;
      }

Whenever user is sending requests with axios I check on server side if user is logged in or have permission like this:

    router.get("/getGroups", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) =&gt; {
      if(req.user.type != "Admin") {
          res.send("auth error");
          return;
      }
      Products.findAll({
        where: { mainId: req.user.mainId },
        attributes: ["group"],
        group: ["group"]
      }).then(data =&gt; {
        res.json(data);
      });
    });

ensureAuthenticated is checking with passport.js. What I'm asking is if it's possible to modify req.user on client side with some tools? Is this a secure way to check user authentication and permissions?
## [9][Heard about the benefit of SSR and started learning Next.js. Now, do I need to update every time from create-react-app to Next or can I start my front-end entirely on Next?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iqqc8q/heard_about_the_benefit_of_ssr_and_started/)

Well, title says it all.

I am so much used to CRA that I am finding it hard to understand if it's possible to start creating the entire frontend in Next or do I need to migrate to Next from CRA!
## [10][Is it still important to know the lifecycle hooks of the React Class Components with Functional Components being the norm?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iqlugm/is_it_still_important_to_know_the_lifecycle_hooks/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iqlugm/is_it_still_important_to_know_the_lifecycle_hooks/

I wonder if we still need to know all lifecycle hooks like \`componentWillReceiveProps\`, \`shouldComponentUpdate\`, etc. if we are never going to choose Class Components.

What are your thoughts?

I have a question regarding heavy state management in React. I am currently developing a React app and am using Redux for state management. However, the more I look into further developing my app, the more I see that my Redux store might be loaded with lots of data and thus become slower eventually. So I was wondering if it is okay to use Context in combination with Redux for state management? Should I take the approach of one solution for all or maybe a combination of both? Is there any other pros or cons I should be aware of?

Thank you very much!
## [12][A bit of lag while horizontally scrolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iqlwmy/a_bit_of_lag_while_horizontally_scrolling/)

Hi Guys 

I am using React table with fixed columns. The scrollbar comes at the end of the table and I wanted to make it float. 

So I made a dummy div with position fixed  and made sure the width of the table and this dummy div is same and then made the original scrollbar hidden

 So I control the scrollLeft position of this scrollbar and change it in the body scrollLeft manually.

Now when I start scrolling I see some stutter and then it becomes fine after I have scrolled once. 

This happens only when I start scrolling. Not able to figure out how to solve this.   
I also tried adding \`will-change\` property but does not seem to have any effect
