We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey, devs! :)

I've been learning React for a few weeks now and I just finished my second project (the [first one](https://github.com/lucasmrl/findheroes) I created to learn about Components and API requests):  
**A resume builder.**

Link: [https://resumiapp.herokuapp.com/](https://resumiapp.herokuapp.com/)  


Github repo: [https://github.com/lucasmrl/resumi](https://github.com/lucasmrl/resumi)


I got inspired by [https://flowcv.io/](https://flowcv.io/app/content) where I created my resume a few months ago and then I saw here the work from [u/AmruthPillai](https://www.reddit.com/user/AmruthPillai/) [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fp88n0/i_made_a_free_and_opensource_resume_builder_using/) Since I am new, I was not completely able to understand all the code/logic he used, so I decided to put in practice what I have been studying about React and also to learn about Hooks, Context API, and React Router.  


After finishing this, "I know that I know nothing". :P

Please, **any feedback** will be much appreciated.

PS: Not mobile-friendly yet.
