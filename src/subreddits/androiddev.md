Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

## [5][Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Android RANT](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iqn47n/firebase_cloud_messaging_fcm_android_rant/)

This is a **rant**. 

First of all I want to say that Firebase is great and Google did a great job there. But this doesn't mean it's perfect.

The following is something relatively small but it has been nagging me for a while now.

Google Firebase Cloud Messaging has 3 ways of sending push notification

1. Notification: this is received by your app if it is in foreground, and directly goes to the notification tray if your app is in background
2. Data: always received by your app
3. Notification+Data: mix of the two, it works like 1) but you get data when you open the notification.

The Firebase Console has a cool tool to build notification of type 1) which give you a preview, let you chose when to send a notification, who to send to... yeah great.

Small, tiny issue.... when you get type 1) in Android and your app is in background your app doesn't receive it, when you click the notification your app is opened but the Intent associated with it **CONTAINS NO DATA** of the notification (title, text, image, whatever).

This is what you get in the extras: 

```
'google.delivered_priority' : 'high'
'google.sent_time' : '1599808968376'
'google.ttl' : '2419200'
'google.original_priority' : 'high'
'from' : '23094812394'
'google.message_id' : '0:198347123094%9d7575989d2304341'
'collapse_key' : 'your.app.package.id'
```

Completely useless, specially cause there's no service to obtain the notification from `google.message_id`. You can't even show the notification inside the app, your app "just opens". 

Oh, but wait, you [could](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#notification-payload-support) at least add `click_action` to the notification to specific what to do when clicked **but** you cannot set it from the firebase console.

Even more outraging: iOS receive that notification and all its data when the user clicks it (title, text, image and everything).

I think we can all agree that a notification with text/image in it that when clicked disappear forever is never gonna be a good UX experience.

So I really don't understand the logic behind this, why would Google give you this kind of behavior and a default backoffice that provides this crippled UX on Android only.

It basically force everyone to always implement a backoffice even for the most basic of the use case even when you wouldn't need it for iOS.

I really can't believe this is what they actually wanted.

BONUS: when the app is in background it builds a notification using all the variable set in the Notification body (image, sound, ... etc) but if you receive it when the app is in foreground and you want to build that same exact notification you need to do it yourself, why not just expose an utility method to do exactly that, Google you already have the code, right?


I just hope someone in Google agree with this and do something to put iOS and Android on par. Just make the notification data available in the extras effectively making your app receive the same information regardless.

(Would be actually AWESOME if it could give a notification history service with read / unread notification out of the box but this is most likely asking too much).

Am I missing something here? Do you agree?
## [6][PSA: Android 11 leaks view hierarchy if you pass a Spannable to a TextView](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iq56zn/psa_android_11_leaks_view_hierarchy_if_you_pass_a/)

edit: Someone pointed out these issues are for Android 9+, which I initially missed. However, something must've changed with Android 11 (or Android 11 emulator), for me this issue is now triggered while on previous versions it's not. Don't believe me though, just install LeakCanary in your apps and check if your apps are still OK

This just popped up from LeakCanary when I was testing app on a new Android 11 emulator. If the reports are correct (I haven't thoroughly tested myself), the view hierarchy will leak through `android.app.assist.AssistStructure`as soon as you set a `Spannable` as the `TextView`'s content. Some links for reference:

## [8][Why didn't Nintendo go with a heavily modified version of Android, as opposed to developing their own OS?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iqn66r/why_didnt_nintendo_go_with_a_heavily_modified/)

I understand that Nintendo wanted a closed ecosystem, and that they wanted to reduce bloat. But couldn't they have just modified Android Go or something, and taken steps to remove all the bloat, in order to ensure that they would have a system that was still closed, but able to benefit from Android development libraries?

Essentially... Couldn't Nintendo have gone with Android whilst ensuring a closed ecosystem?

I think Amazon have succeeded in this, as they have the Fire OS which is used for their Kindle Fire tablet line.

Hello,
I need help, I'm looking for a way to read several audio sources at the same time on my phone, without the first one being cut off. Example: Youtube and Spotify at the same time.
Can you tell me how I could do this? Do I need a specific programme? I'm willing to pay for it. Thank you.
