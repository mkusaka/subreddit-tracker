Have no idea if it is something I've done or what? No apps on the emulator are changing orientation. Even the stock apps that are pre loaded on it? Anyone know what the problem could be?

Hi,

I'm a complete beginner in appdev, have some knowledge like HTML, CSS in webdev.

I want to develop 2d android games like Bubble Ball, Angry Birds etc by myself as I don't have a lot of money to pay others to do it for me.

my questions are:

1. How much would it cost me to build, launch and make this app successful (at least making $500 a month or more?)
2. How long would it take me to do this? Learning appdev and then making the app?

Thanks for your answers

G'day Android Devs! 

I'm a relatively new Android developer (but experienced with web and iOS). I'm getting ready to release my first app on the play store, but I'm having trouble with testing the app. The app fetches  data from a server, stores locally and displays on the device. 

The 'internal testing' version of the app on the play store is unresponsive and shows an endless progress bar spinner, but building and installing via Android Studio, it works fine, no changes anywhere else. I've tried with multiple devices and users, all have the same result. As I don't have a debugger attached for the Internal Test build on the Play store, and the fact that it works fine in the development environment, it's difficult to know where to start debugging an issue like this.

As I'm new to Android development, the cause of the issue is likely something basic that I've overlooked.

If anyone could point me in the right direction of where I could start looking that would be awesome.

Much Appreciated ðŸ¤™
## [9][Birthday Picker some people struggeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/joi4j5/birthday_picker_some_people_struggeling/)

Hello,

most of our apps have some kind of birthday selection. I use the android default Picker. On Huawei phone there are 3 dropdowns, but most of the phones have the standard anroid calendar.

It is very beautiful and easy to use, but sometimes the people use it the wrong way and get frustrated.  Instead of tap on the year, they just swipe through the months. It is not my problem, but we have over 5k reviews and about 20-50 are negative because of this incorrect usage.

I know, it is not a lot, but have you seen any other good example of an easier to enter birthday field. We are having now 3 entry fields and a link to the picker, to get everyone happy, but it doesn't look so good.
## [10][MPAndroidChart: Set different colors on live LineDataSet](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/joi1a8/mpandroidchart_set_different_colors_on_live/)

Hello guys,

Do you know if it is possible to use different colors on a live LineDataSet depending of the values?

For example, for every values above 50, display the point in red, and for every values below 50 in green.

I managed to do it on a static LineDataSet using setColors but I am struggling with a live one. Is it possible?

Thank you so much,
