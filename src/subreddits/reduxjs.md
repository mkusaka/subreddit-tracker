Hello fellows

I have created a new alternative to the Redux library. It is much simpler and powerful. [https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux](https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux)

I would appreciate having your feedback!

Are there any best practices, guides, or libraries out there to simplify/standardize how caching is handled in Redux?

For now, I'm keeping a boolean in my reducers. If that value is false and I try to fetch data, it'll just no-op.

I'm making a countdown timer with Redux, and the timer is stored in Redux. My doubt is about performance/design patterns: There is a problem with dispatching every second?

Hey,
Anyone out there knows if this is possible?

Currently fetch from localhost (with json server) for front end development, now i need to deploy this to production.

Any tips on approach with serverless, expressjs, mongodb, nodejs etc? 

Have been searching the internet but only finds articles for local development and saw alot of approaches with serverless express like proxying the localhost, serve static http server, etc.

*Got deployment setup against Netlify

Hello everybody,I'm creating my first React SPA and I'm implementing both redux and react-redux for the first time.

Since I'm using react-router to render different page-components, I was thinking to split redux actions, reducers, etc. for each component, but to begin to write these components I've put everything in one folder, like this (I've omitted the rest of the project because there are a lot of files!)

    src
    â”œâ”€â”€ Selector
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ public
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.less
    â”œâ”€â”€ redux
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ actions.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reducers.ts
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ store.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.tsx
    â””â”€â”€ model.ts

So, how you are used to organizing all the redux stuff in your projects? Thank you! ðŸš€
