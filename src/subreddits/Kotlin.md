This place kinda feels like a desert. No weekly threads, no apparent moderation. Half of the questions posted are about the Android SDK and have 0 relevancy to Kotlin.

Not trying to diss the moderators but I haven't seen a sign of life from any of them.
## [2][Should I go with just Kotlin or learn some basic Java first?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hwwk2p/should_i_go_with_just_kotlin_or_learn_some_basic/)

I enrolled in a Udemy course to learn Kotlin (over 50 hours). I also have a small 12 hour crash course on Java. Should I finish the Java course before starting the Kotlin one? Neither courses expire at any time. My plan is becoming an Android developer building apps. 

Second question: is Kotlin really going to be the long-term language going forward for Android development and is it easier than Java? Appreciate all input as I'm a beginner. Thank you!
## [3][Kotlin maven plugin dependencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hwxsw1/kotlin_maven_plugin_dependencies/)

I am accessing kotlin libs from offline repository and using kotlin maven plugin. I set the plugin in pom but it creates new dependencies like kotlin-compiler etc. Then I have somebody add this to offline repo and rebuild and this time there is another error saying "this dependency could not be resolved". So again I need to have somebody add another lib to repo.

It is not okay for me to mail someone everytime I got error and need lib to be added. Can I see what dependencies kotlin-maven-plugin brings from doc or somewhere? I could not find it yet.

I've been meaning to make apps for Android on android studio. I only know the extreme basics of Java, C++, JS. So I'd like to learn Kotlin from scratch using video tutorials or whatever resources that are out there. Could yall please put some in the comment below? 

Thank you!

I'm still new to Kotlin and just wanted to know how I can index a value based on a variable?

    val name = "activity_home"
    
    //val test = R.layout.activity_home
    val test = R.layout[name]

Is it possible to create My app to manage My credentials for many services like prime video, hulu, etc add authenticate the apps automatically? 

I think an example would be when You open Facebook it allows You to authenticate messenger.

Which function would help me? 

Thanks!

Which one should I use? They both fundamentally do the same thing so I don't know which one to pick.
