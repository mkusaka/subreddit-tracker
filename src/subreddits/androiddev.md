Something that I think I could have had when I started with Android development:

Hello,

from last month I was experiencing a huge CPM drop (over 50%) in my android games. 

I was wondering if this is just me or you also experience this due to COVID situation.

I see the Admob Native Ads is the awesome ad to flexible UI which can be easy like up with my application. So, I have tried to implement Admob Native Ads into my Android App. But I got the issue when load ad. My app has been blocking UI Thread when the ad is being loaded. I have used Native Ads for recyclerview. This is example for that which I have forked from google example repository and modify for the same with my implementation.

[https://github.com/sinhpn92/admob-native-ad-example](https://github.com/sinhpn92/admob-native-ad-example)

I have tried to put the load ads inside asynctask or kotlin coroutines thread but It's still have this problem. I did upgrade to latest version.

I have some question:

* Have anyone has facing this issue?.
* Is that problem of admob sdk?.
* Have any suggest to solve this issue?.

Thanks for your time.
## [8][Trouble with saving emulator snapshots](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gaux0v/trouble_with_saving_emulator_snapshots/)

I've been trying to get this to work for a few days now, but I can't seem to figure this out. 

I'm trying to use the `-snapshot` flag but the emulator seems to refuse to save it. When I close the emulator I get this message `emulator: WARNING: Discarding the changed state (command-line flag).`. 

I'm not passing it any flag to stop it from saving. The command I'm using to start it is `./emulator @&lt;My AVD&gt; -snapshot &lt;The snapshot name I'm using&gt;`.

I've tried doing the same on older versions of the emulator but this keeps occurring. Am I doing something wrong/missing something?

## [10][Minimum SDK version](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gaqyc2/minimum_sdk_version/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gaqyc2/minimum_sdk_version/
---
I know this must be a, somewhat, common question, but I cant find good information on it. 

I've developed a couple of apps, both for personal use as for some friends, this to say I have some understanding and a bit of experience developing apps. But every time I start a new app I always face myself with choosing the minimum SDK version and I never have much confidence in the option I choose. 

I've looked at Google's Version Distribution dashboard, it's good to have an idea of the percentages of devices using each version. 

But my question is, **which SDK version is a good compromise between a good coverage and good performance/features?**

Hope someone can enlighten me. Thanks

I want to create a custom circular button with animations. For that, I use a circle as a vector and a custom view where I want to change dynamically this vector in OnDraw (e.x scale it, translate, etc). I know that I can animate a vector by XML however this solution doesn't fit my use case.

One solution would be to transform this vector to bitmap then apply changes (for example scale it by radius) and finally draw it to the canvas. I this a good practice? Can you recommend any good open source project that uses vectors and animations?

Hello, readers of Reddit, Iâ€™m writing to you from cold Russia:)  
Iâ€™m here to share with you one more story of a developerâ€™s account lock-out in Google Play. On the 26th of March, in the evening, I received a standard email from Google:

[ Letter from Google ](https://preview.redd.it/5ooieknstqv41.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a56cdafefc1958d4a9867f80874ad002dfa214b9)

At first I didnâ€™t understand whatâ€™s the problem is and of course I sent a notice of appeal. I received a standard answer. The same was with the next notice of appeal. **Now I already have 7 notices of appeal**. I donâ€™t even receive any automatic answer for the last ones. It seems to me that a few days ago I found out the reason of a possible lock-out. One of my games was tested by the publisher at his account. During this period the game got two warnings as a result of violation with incorrect integration of SDK of the necessary services. The publishers didnâ€™t like the game and they returned it to my account. And maybe their rejects came to my account together with the application. Iâ€™m not absolutely sure in it, but this is the only rational basis.  
**Thatâ€™s why be careful with transference of the application after its rejects on the other peopleâ€™s accounts**. I canâ€™t understand the politics of Google. Why should I be responsible for the other peopleâ€™s rejects with the help of my account? Whereby their account continues to exist. Is it fair? I also want to add that Iâ€™m not a creator of trash applications and games. I had 2 qualitative games on my single account (**which is more than two years old**). I spent a lot of **thousands of dollars**, as well as energy and time on each game. And we wanted least of all to violate the rules and somehow be in conflict with the bots from Google.

**My first** app was a cute door simulation game. A huge amount of effort was invested in it. It had about 30 thousand installations. Unfortunately, the application could not pass the test at the publisher. And had the status: Reject. This was due to the obsolete Appodeal SDK. I made plans to revive this game and retest the publisher with the hope of a positive result. (I apologize for the screenshots with the text, this is not an advertisement)

[Map\_1](https://preview.redd.it/uaqno61ztqv41.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc9ecede414540a8536136110e27cd9ecc90f6c8)

**The second** game was a dark platformer about black substance. This game has gone through many iterations. And during the next test, I got a ban on the whole account. Most likely this particular game didnâ€™t please Google bots.

[Substance](https://preview.redd.it/84s4xp56uqv41.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b27527d2fba83810f1bfe2297f75cba889f264a0)

What I have learnt and what I can share with people who are in the same situation is the following:

* Be careful with the transfers of the applications as you can get application rejects from the other peopleâ€™s accounts and damage your account. (Iâ€™m not absolutely sure in it) - the way of searching for the people from Google at **LinkedIn + Rocket Reach** is useless. I tried to find people working in support with the help of these services during month. Unfortunately, in all the cases I faced up with ignoring. If someone wants to do this, then search for: Appeals Specialist at Google, Play Developer Support Specialist, Developer Support Specialist - Accenture\\Vaco at Google, Support Appeals Specialist - Accenture\\Vaco at Google. As I understood, Google transfers the part of operations concerning the support of the users to the companies **Accenture** and **Vaco**. But these are my personal insights and guesses. You shouldnâ€™t accept them at their face-value. Possibly, somebody will be lucky and he or she will find a person who will answer.
* Sending emails is also quite useless. But here I was lucky and two people replied to me at once. One of them was from **Policy Team** and the other one was a **Developer Advocate**. They both told me that they felt sorry but couldnâ€™t help me and they gave me a link for a standard form of a notice of appeal.
* If your account brings you less than 5 thousand dollars per month for inner purchases, then the likelihood that your notice of appeal will be considered by an alive person is about **1%**. Especially this situation heated up because of COVID-19. Maybe they donâ€™t have enough specialists.
* The variant of asking for help people who I know and who work in Google also doesnâ€™t work (they did an internal inquiry).
* Writing on the **Google Help Forum** is also useless.

Finally, there is only a variant with making this problem well-known. According to the same topics this variant may work and kind people from Google can see and give a break to the developer.Very sadly, that this problem lasts through years and is still relevant in 2020. Iâ€™m ready to **pay hundreds of dollars per year, and not 25 once**, if in hour of need there will be an alive person to help me, but not this useless AI.  
**Update: 6 hours after this post my account was unblocked. I thank everyone who supported me. And thank the person who did this. I hope someday Google will expand the support staff and these problems will not have to be solved by reddit.**
