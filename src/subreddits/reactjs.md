Hi All,

I have been messing with it for a LONG while (few weeks now). I'm trying to compress/resize an image before uploading. Generally would want 150x150 or 300x300 images.

I tried using [https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-image-compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-image-compression) which has 26k downloads per week. But using the demo (and trying in my app) it appears if you reduce image to lets say 150x150 pixels the quality is getting pixelated badly compare for example if you do it with MS Paint or something.

Is it possible to do it on the client side or do I need to opt and do it on the server side? Any help would be appreciated. 

Thanks

## [12][What are the equivalents of AppBar parameters (material-ui version 0.20 ) in version 3.9.3 of mui?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/in0l3t/what_are_the_equivalents_of_appbar_parameters/)

I have a website based on mui 0.20 &amp; i want to upgrade it. For  example, I want to migrate the AppBar of version 0.20 to version 3.9.3,  the properties are:

&amp;#x200B;

* iconElementLeft
* iconElementRight
* onLeftIconButtonClick
* showMenuIconButton
* zDepth ....

I can't find the equivalents for these parameters in version 3.9.3, i  face the same situation for the other components, is there a way to  migrate ?
