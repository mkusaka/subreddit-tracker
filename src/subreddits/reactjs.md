We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi! I made a bash-like 'new tab' page for chrome/edge.

You can manage url shortcuts with simple command line interface.

Also you can develop and install custom javascript packages on the shell

Following commands are supported now ..

    ls, mv, rm, echo, tire(package installer)

If you install the program and give me a review, it would  be very helpful for me studying react.

`&lt;Router&gt;`  
 `&lt;div className="App"&gt;`  
 `&lt;Switch&gt;`  
 `&lt;Route path="/group/:id" component={GroupDetails}/&gt;`  
 `&lt;Route exact path="/" component={Intro}/&gt;`   
 `&lt;Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard}/&gt;`   
   
   
 `&lt;/Switch&gt;`  
   
 `&lt;/div&gt;`  
 `&lt;/Router&gt;`

this is my app.js routes  
now I need to open the group details page when I click on a link in a list  
this is my list component  


`const GroupList = ({groups}) =&gt;{`  
   
 `return(`  
 `&lt;div className="row"&gt;`  
 `{groups&amp;&amp;groups.map(group=&gt;{`  
   
 `return(`  
 `&lt;div className="col s12 m6 l3"&gt;`  
 `&lt;Link to={'/group/'+group._id}&gt;`  
 `&lt;GroupCard group={group}/&gt;`  
 `&lt;/Link&gt;`  
 `&lt;/div&gt;`  
`)`  
`})}`  
   
   
   
 `&lt;/div&gt;`  
`)`  
`}`

Here as you can see i am passing the {group} prop to GroupCard component and it works  
now I need to pass the {group} prop  to the link which calls the GroupDetails component. Can anyone tell me how should i do this

Hey folks, so I was wondering about a certain use case I have on my project at the moment.

I have a table component that is filled with notifications. Each notification in the table has a name, date and id. On each table row click a new modal component is displayed and notification id is passed as a prop to the modal. Modal component then makes another call to the server and displays the current notification details.

I was wondering if there is any benefit to making the call in the *onRowClick()* function in the table component, getting the whole notification object with the details and passing the whole object to the modal?
