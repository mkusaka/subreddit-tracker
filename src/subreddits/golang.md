Gomobile doesn't support Android anymore. Are there any other alternatives for writing Android apps in Go?

I am new to Go and also a sophomore undergrad. This is a traditional Ping utility written by me in Go using ICMP requests from scratch for both ipv4 and ipv6. [Github  repo link](https://github.com/shivamanipatil/GoPing)  . It is a small program and supports some of the functionalities of traditional Ping. It would be helpful if you could provide suggestions or feedback.

I made this development for my personal needs.  It works ok for me.  I would be glad if somebody else finds some use in it.

So I am coming from a a python and js background, and can write OOP code on both, and have a pretty strong grasp of interfaces for TS as an example. But go interfaces really confuse me. So far, I have formed two theories about go interfaces. 

- An empty interface can be used to specify an unknown type, followed by a type assertion if being used somewhere. Most common example I have see in Json data without a definition. 
- An interface can sort of used extend other types, like how structs have receivers (this seems more like python oop with self to me). 

Both these two theories are guesses, but as I explore more libraries in go, i see some of them often implement interfaces. Instead of just copying pasting code and just get it to work, I would like to really understand interfaces (maybe with a python based follow along?). 

Does anyone have any recommendations for some learning materials?

I have heard about caddy2, but it seems like a lot of the docs are for version 1.

I've also heard people set up nginx and do it that way.  I'm looking for something easy to maintain, which won't see a lot of traffic, probably on digital ocean or linode?

Thanks everyone!
