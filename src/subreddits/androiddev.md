This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

We’re on the engineering team for Android Jetpack &amp; Jetpack Compose, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, August 27**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), focusing on a new topic every week. We’re excited to close out our [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid) with a focus on UI, and on Thursday we’ll be hosting an AMA on the Android Jetpack and Jetpack Compose!

[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is our suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We launched several new libraries like Hilt for Dependency Injection, App Startup, and updates to Paging, Navigation, CameraX, and more.  Check out the Jetpack updates we made during #11WeeksOfAndroid [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-jetpack.html).

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI - declarative, composable, and more! We’re currently in developer preview and excited to show you more next week, when we will focus the week on UI! Check out our overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5BwfqBpiWU) and try the [tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial) to learn more.

For this AMA, we want to answer your *technical* questions about Android Jetpack and Compose.  No roadmaps :)

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, August 27 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PDT / 4:20 PM EDT.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

**Here are some topics we’re looking forward to talking about, but feel free to ask anything!**

* Jetpack Compose
* Hilt
* Navigation
* WorkManager
* Paging
* Permissions
* App Startup
* AppCompat
* CameraX

**Thank you, Reddit**

Thank you for making this possible! After my previous post here, it only took two days until my app “Hue Edge” has ended up as #1 at the Top Chart (same category) of the Samsung Galaxy App Store!

To this day it has reached over 200 downloads! The app was met with very positive feedback and many interesting feature suggestions from you, the users. I could have not done this without your support and encouragement! I must admit that I have had my moments of despair and wanted to give up in the middle of developing the app as I have encountered problems above my skill-level. I am glad that I have kept learning and kept trying until I could solve those problems.

I have worked countless hours, remade, refined, and polished every aspect of it until I was satisfied with the quality. My goal for my app is for it to be quick, clean, responsive, and bring joy to users when they interface with it. Today I am releasing an update to version 1.1, which brings a ton of improvements across the board.

**Update**

I have tried to pack in as many features, fixes, and optimizations as I could into this update. While perfection is very abstract, I think this update brings my app closer to it. I will keep listening to user feedback and try to find ways of making the user experience better.

List of changes:

• Reworked setup process with animated transitions  
 • Many under-the-hood improvements in performance and stability  
 • Improvements to handling quick successions of multiple buttons presses  
 • New settings that let you adjust the number of levels for brightness, color and saturation  
 • Pop-up tips for first-time users  
 • Ability to long-tap the scenes to activate them and proceed to adjustment of the associated group  
 • Error messages for cases when Wi-Fi is turned off or the Hue Bridge cannot be reached  
 • Adjustments to the transparency of the ring animations on buttons making them more subtle  
 • Adjustments to font and size of the text on the buttons  
 • Fix the animation of pull-to-refresh to be visible until the refresh is complete  
 • Capitalization of "Edge" in name, as it could be considered an accidental misspelling by some users

**Open-Source**

Since day one, I have decided to keep the app open source. If you want to create a similar app to control some other type of equipment, you are more than welcome. I will also gladly take any feedback on my code.

**Conclusion**

I am very thankful to the community for giving a new developer like me a chance. The amount of positive feedback and response made me very happy! I feel good knowing that my app brings value and joy to the people using it. As for other new developers out there, remember that anyone, if persistent enough, can create apps and reach their goals. Put in your time into work and do not give up when you encounter problems. If you fail, you can always try again and try a different approach!

I got a 32GB Ram Dell XPS which is more than enough for developing on Android and using Android Studio, a friend of mine has a MacBook with 8GB of RAM and struggles a lot with Android Studio, it freezes the computer, takes a lot of time to do builds etc.

So I wondered how much would really need Android Studio to run well and do builds without blocking your computer. A simple answer I think it would be 16GB (a middle answer) but do you think there is a real "minimum" or a "ideal" configuration?

Hey,  
firebase provides the google-services.json file in order to use some services of firebase. I just wonder how this works? Are this sensitiv information?

Hi,

my app depends on openCv and bunch of other unrelated native C libraries.

I recently happily raised minSdk of the project from 21 to 23.

&amp;#x200B;

*And apk size* ***increased*** *by 20MB with that change alone*

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense to anyone?
