Since Kotlin supports JS, is it possible for Kotlin Compose to be ported to web? (I was thinking whether is possible to match Flutter's platform set)

**What is it?**

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (Kotlin, Java, Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Python,..).

**Motivation**

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.

**PS**

I trained the Kotlin model on LeakCanary.

 Teacher asked me to create a Smile in canvas and when I press right the smile moves right. He also told me to leave the smile's variables as vals not as vals, for me to move the ball I had to create a new smile with the old smile's values. How?? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    data class Smile(val x: Int, val y: Int, val  radius: Int)
    
    fun drawSmile( smile: Smile, canvas: Canvas):Unit{
        canvas.drawCircle(smile.x,smile.y, smile.radius, pt.isel.canvas.YELLOW)
        canvas.drawCircle(smile.x, smile.y, smile.radius, 0, (0.07*smile.radius).toInt())
        canvas.drawArc(smile.x,smile.y, (0.6*smile.radius).toInt(),200,340, 0, (0.07*smile.radius).toInt())
        canvas.drawCircle(smile.x-(0.35*smile.radius).toInt(),smile.y-(0.35*smile.radius).toInt(),(0.125*smile.radius).toInt(), color= BLACK)
        canvas.drawCircle(smile.x+(0.35*smile.radius).toInt(),smile.y-(0.35*smile.radius).toInt(),(0.125*smile.radius).toInt(), color= BLACK)
    
    fun move(smile: Smile, canvas: Canvas, ke: Int, increment: Int = 4): Unit {
      canvas.erase()
      val x: Int = smile.x
      val y: Int = smile.y
      val rad = smile.radius
      val smile: Smile
      when (ke) {
        39 -&gt; smile = Smile(x + 4, y, rad)
        else -&gt; smile = Smile(x, y, rad)
      }
      drawSmile(smile, canvas)
    }
    
    fun main() {
      println("Hi, Smile! :)")
    
      onStart {
        val canvas = Canvas(600, 400, CYAN)
        //FIRST SMILE
        val xCenter = 600 / 2
        val yCenter = 400 / 2
        val radius = 50
        var smile = Smile(xCenter, yCenter, radius)
        println("Move the smile with the arrows or mouse")
        println("Grow and shrink with + and -")
        drawSmile(smile, canvas)
        canvas.onKeyPressed { ke -&gt;
          move(smile, canvas, ke.code)
        }
    
        canvas.onMouseDown { MousePlacer -&gt;
          placeSmile(smile, canvas, MousePlacer.x, MousePlacer.y)
        }
    
        onFinish {
          println("BYE")
        }
      }
    }
