Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

In the end the [problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gj4t26/it_is_not_just_us_none_can_escape_vague_terms_of/) reported by u/NLL-APPS has been solved.

What remains is that the resolution of problems related to the management of Google Stores in some cases only passes through social media: [https://twitter.com/DotProto/status/1261047663669084161](https://twitter.com/DotProto/status/1261047663669084161)

Save this Twitter address: [https://twitter.com/DotProto](https://twitter.com/DotProto) Could be our last resort for Chrome Store issues and hopefully also for Play Store issues.

I made a two piece article on how to build an app without third party libs, by starting the app with a standard stack and then removing lib by lib. It's over at Medium: [Part 1](https://medium.com/@kelmer/back-to-the-basics-android-with-no-libraries-part-1-2bd8c5e5d725) [Part 2](https://medium.com/@kelmer/back-to-the-basics-android-with-no-libraries-part-2-6ad90428baca)

I took many shortcuts of course and the implementation is far from perfect, but I found it was a great exercise to demonstrate how much heavy lifting these libs do for us :)

Hope you guys like it and of course feel free to give feedback :)

I am about to publish my first Android game in the US market, and am looking at including rewarded video ads as a way to get an extra life without paying.

However, I have no idea what kind of fill rates I can expect on such ads. How many rewarded video ads  could I expect a typical US-based user to have filled in a day, before the eCPM drops off drastically?  Furthermore, what sort of eCPM should I expect? I'm looking at using mediation with Appodeal, though other suggestions are welcome.

Many thanks!

Hi, 
I'm developing Control Managment app for restaurants, factories etc. In our Web app there are few checkboxes which user must fullfill on daily basis. Some of this checkboxes are related to COVID-19, here is one example:
COVID-19 GENERAL PREVENTION (TITLE) 
- Do your employees use facemasks to prevent infection with COVID-19?

Is this type of app allowed to be published on Google Play, beacuse I know a lot of apps related to covid-19 was removed from Google play.

Hey everyone,

I come from a non technical background but have recently been teaching myself Python and made an app. I am in the very final stage of testing the apk on other devices (it already works fine on my own!) and then deploying it to the Play Store.

The issue I am having is that all of a sudden, things have got very technical for me and I am struggling with getting emulators to work, and making full sense of the documentation (probably as I skipped a lot of app development basics to make this).  I have asked a couple people in my network, however they have never fully submitted things to the play store and so weren't that helpful.

I really want to finish the project however and deploy it to the Play Store, and am increasingly getting tempted to pay someone to do the final part, as I feel like I'm going round and round in circles not understanding what to do next.

How much would you guys think is a reasonable amount for this and what should I keep a look out for? It's literally just a case of viewing it on different emulators, and then uploading it (after creating my keys etc). 

Would really appreciate any advice :)
