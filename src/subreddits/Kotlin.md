I'm trying to make an object to simply hold data. However, since the data is coming from HTTP requests, the object needs to be instantiated before any data can be added to it. Kotlin doesn't allow data classes to be created without an argument to its primary constructor, making this approach impossible without having some arbitrary value to pass to it.

Why are data classes like this? Why can't you have an empty data class?

I'm not 100 percent sure this is the place for this but it might be useful for other java devs looking at this sub to see whether it's worth making the switch.

I recently enrolled in Svetlana Isakova @ JetBrains' excellent coursera course "Kotlin for Java developers" I found it supremely informative and though I have not finished yet, I was motivated enough to complete 4.5 of the five weeks of material in just a few days. While I am used to Java and personally do not like using some other languages like python, I could immediately see the great advantages that Kotlin offers. I have decided to list some of my top 5 reasons to use Kotlin so that others may be swayed.

1. Java interoperability. Kotlin can be used with java code in a project directly, can be seamlessly converted to from java and can use any Java library.

2.:Runs on JVM, Android, JavaScript(!) and native executables on certain platforms. You can use it everywhere you can use java and beyond.

3.:It's clean and concise. Seriously, it is just so much more compact. On occasions I've been able to condense 20 lines of java into 4 lines of Kotlin. I think that speaks for itself.

4.: Functional And Oop. I think Kotlin strikes a great balance between a pure functional style as seen e.g. in Haskell and a classic Object oriented approach like I was familiar with from Java and c#. Depending on your preferences, you can use both styles. I think this aids a great deal in transitioning to the language.

5. Easy to learn from a Java background. As I have already said, I went from knowing literally nothing in Kotlin to a rather respectable level in just a few days. Transposing and transferring prior knowledge from Java to Kotlin works seamlessly and if you forget how to do something in Kotlin, you can just write it in java and either use the java code directly or convert it to Kotlin code.

Tl:Dr just learn kotlin
I hope this helps someone

Edit: HOW did I forget about nullability? Of course! I suppose it's just something that wasn't on my mind when I wrote this.

6. Nullability. Do I need to say more?

This place kinda feels like a desert. No weekly threads, no apparent moderation. Half of the questions posted are about the Android SDK and have 0 relevancy to Kotlin.

Not trying to diss the moderators but I haven't seen a sign of life from any of them.
## [5][Proposal: Community Content Creation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hx7p4y/proposal_community_content_creation/)

Personally, I come here to learn and ask questions when needed. But it would be nice if we can have some active content creation on a regular schedule by the members of the community from different levels of experience.

This can get a little bit messy if people are just posting their courses for sale or linking to their business, basically not following rule #2: no spamming.

But as long as the content is accessible by all (a reddit post, your blog post or a youtube video, etc.) and high quality, I think it can make the community more lively and therefore provide a richer experience for current and future members.

What do you guys think?

I'm new to Kotlin but familiar with Java, so I decided to start this course by jetbrains, but when installing the eduTools plugin and selecting the assignment of week 2, nothing showed up on the course view of the project, and on the regular view I saw only the gradle packages. Did anyone else encounter this problem and how do I fix it?

I enrolled in a Udemy course to learn Kotlin (over 50 hours). I also have a small 12 hour crash course on Java. Should I finish the Java course before starting the Kotlin one? Neither courses expire at any time. My plan is becoming an Android developer building apps. 

Second question: is Kotlin really going to be the long-term language going forward for Android development and is it easier than Java? Appreciate all input as I'm a beginner. Thank you!

I am accessing kotlin libs from offline repository and using kotlin maven plugin. I set the plugin in pom but it creates new dependencies like kotlin-compiler etc. Then I have somebody add this to offline repo and rebuild and this time there is another error saying "this dependency could not be resolved". So again I need to have somebody add another lib to repo.

It is not okay for me to mail someone everytime I got error and need lib to be added. Can I see what dependencies kotlin-maven-plugin brings from doc or somewhere? I could not find it yet.

I've been meaning to make apps for Android on android studio. I only know the extreme basics of Java, C++, JS. So I'd like to learn Kotlin from scratch using video tutorials or whatever resources that are out there. Could yall please put some in the comment below? 

Thank you!
