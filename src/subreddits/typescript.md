The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

I was looking for something like this but could find nothing that fitted. The goal is to be a reference when looking things up with great examples that only demonstrate the syntax and problem/solution, not a load of other stuff which tends to be the case in blog examples.

Once I am happy with it I will create an attractive formatted PDF to print and have that as a link too.

I have taken examples from mainly the official docs and various blog posts by some great authors including quite a bit of Marius Schulz.

The other goal is to try and include only what most people would need, and omit any old ways of doing things, so it is quite opinionated like that. 

In my personal TS journey this is all the stuff I have needed and wanted a reference to come back to, especially with easy to understand examples. Obvious things are left out:

tsparticles - Resurrecting particles.js

Hi all,

I'm resurrecting the old particles.js, updated and converted to typescript. I've implemented some new features and fixes requested by users on the old project.

I've tried about 100 different things, and basically want I want to achieve is simply


    interface Serializable {
      serialize(): this;
      static deserialize(input: string): this;
    }

Obviously there's no way to define static methods on an interface, but is there no other way to achieve this if I control how the parameters of a function are typed?

As the title says, Iâ€™m trying to bundle a typescript app with webpack using ts-loader. I have several other typescripts module as dependencies which are declared in tsconfig.json paths section. Tsc works great. When using webpack and tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin, those modules are treated as external and are not bundled (with the message no static exports). If Iâ€™m importing them using a relative path, then their transpiled code is added into the bundle. Is there a way to add their code to the bundle without changing every import in the project to a relative path?

## [9][Test if a property exists on a disjoint type?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f9fdrk/test_if_a_property_exists_on_a_disjoint_type/)

If I have a Foo with a 'name' but Bar doesn't have a name and I have:

  type MyType = Foo | Bar;

.. it SEEMS like I should be able to do:

  if (myType.name) {
  ... 
  }

But typescript says that this is an error as 'name' doesn't exist on Bar.

What's the best way to do this?  I don't want to cast it to &lt;any&gt; because I want to know that this type exists in Foo ... but I'm not actually sure it IS a foo yet (thus the test for .name)

Thoughts?
## [10][When creating a debounce decorator function, how do I inform TypeScript there will be args?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f9asjm/when_creating_a_debounce_decorator_function_how/)

I was trying to convert a previous debounce decorator function I'd made in JS to TS, and am running into an issue where the TS interpreted is expecting 0 args, but I need to provide one. Here's the code:

    function debounce(fn: { (message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void; (message?: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): void; apply?: any; }, minTime: number){
        let isCooldown = false;
        return function(){
            if (isCooldown){ return; }
            fn.apply(this, arguments);
            isCooldown = true;
            setTimeout(() =&gt; isCooldown = false, minTime)
        }
    }

    let log = debounce(console.log, 1000);

    log('Hi'); // runs immediately
    log('Ignore me!');

    setTimeout(() =&gt; log('Ignore me as well!'), 100); // ignored ( only 100 ms passed )
    setTimeout(() =&gt; log('Don\'t ignore me!!'), 1100); // Runs because enough time has passed
    setTimeout(() =&gt; log('Still ignored!'), 1500); //  ignored (less than 1000 ms from the last run)
    setTimeout(() =&gt; log('Good now you get it!!'), 2200); // Runs because enough time has passed

Everywhere I use the log function, tslint tells me expected 0 args but got 1. Any advice is greatly appreciated, still new to TypeScript
