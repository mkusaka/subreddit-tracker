I recently bought the new Macbook Air with the 1.1GHz Quad-Core Core i5 and 8gb of ram. I am used to working on a top of the line MBP but was unfortunately let go recently due to the pandemic and wanted to pick up a machine to be able to continue developing.

My question is, do you think I may have undercut myself by choosing only 8gb of ram? The deciding factor was being able to get it in 2 days instead of 2 weeks, but I am wondering if anyone have experience with React specifically on 8gb of ram and if I should return it and upgrade.

Side note, React developer available for remote hire :)

Hi,

I've been working on a Visual Studio NetCore Entity Framework project that contains a React client side.


Does anyone know the best way to publish something like this to an IIS Server?  Would you just publish normally or would you need to go and setup the React side manually and then publish?


Thanks!
## [9][GatsbyJS: How to intercept hash part of url change event properly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g2e4ie/gatsbyjs_how_to_intercept_hash_part_of_url_change/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g2e4ie/gatsbyjs_how_to_intercept_hash_part_of_url_change/

I am building a site based on GatsbyJS.

There is a page with a sub-component that renders dynamically based on state change. Think of a widget with tabs. Switching between tabs is not really a problem: changing state and url on tab title click.

The initial tab (state) is defined by url hash. If there is no any hash the state defaults to the first tab.

The problem is with site navigation side bar that is basically is a list of `&lt;Link&gt;`s. A simplified example of component output:

    &lt;Link to="/companies"&gt;Companies&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/companies#annual-income"&gt;- by annual income&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/companies#staff"&gt;- by operational staff&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/individuals"&gt;People&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/individuals#annual-income"&gt;- by annual income&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/individuals#list"&gt;- by last name&lt;/Link&gt;

When current page is, say, `/companies` navigation to any of the links under `/individuals` produces expected result. However click on any `/companies#..` link changes the url as expected but doesn't activates relevant tab.

I'd like to keep it that simple and avoid introducing any global app state.

I also do not like an idea of patching routing part of the site as in Gatsby it's kinda hidden in backstage and this might affect further development and maintenance.

I also thought of listening to the location change event. This means that I need to unsubscribe event listener when user navigates away to a different page. And I didn't find an elegant way to handle this (I do not use classy components with `ComponentWillUnmount` method).

Will appreciate any ideas.

Does anyone know if react hooks will eventually get an implementation that works like useSelector in redux? I feel that's the only thing really missing that's needed to become a proper redux alternative

I am currently in a situation where I need to update multiple parent components based on a button submit that happens in a child component.

The situation is as follows:

[imgur.com/a/72L0ReM](https://imgur.com/a/72L0ReM)

Now for point 1 I could pass the handleRefetch option through all the components until it reaches the Section component. And could do the same for point 2 which should ultimately trigger the refetch in the List component. But it feels like itâ€™s kinda getting out of control.

One thing to note is that a similar situation will occur in the application for other sections as well.

What I was thinking of was either create a separate [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) component which handles the data fetching for both. Or go for [RXJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview) which has observables.

Any recommendations?

Hello there,

I have a ReactJS application being served from an ExpressJS server and CRA scripts. Part of the application is to parse an RSS feed, however when I try to request the feed I get:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at X from origin Y has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

After searching for it, I found out that in order to solve it I need to set up a proxy. So I created an endpoint in the server (eg. `/feed`) using `express-http-proxy` library to proxy the requests and append `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response.

My code looks like:

```js
app.get('/feed', proxy(function(req, res){
    return getHostname(req.headers['feed-url']);
},
{
            proxyReqPathResolver: function(req){
                return getPath(req.headers['feed-url']);
            },
            userResDecorator: (proxyRes, proxyResData, userReq, userRes) =&gt; {
                proxyRes.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
                data = JSON.parse(proxyResData.toString('utf8'));
                return JSON.stringify(data);
            }
        }
));

```
When I query the server from the React application using `axios`, I still get the error message.

```javascript
axios.get('/feed', postConfig).then(r =&gt; {

// parse data etc.

});

```

- Is there something very visible that I am doing wrong?

- I also tried adding `app.use(cors())` but didn't work

- The library I am using (`express-http-proxy`) does not look very much maintained. Do you have an alternative to propose?


Thank you in advance
