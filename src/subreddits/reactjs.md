I'm planning to commit to the "100 days of code" challenge and for each day, I'm thinking of creating a web app from scratch. This will, obviously, be time-consuming but would be greatly beneficial. However, I can't come up with enough ideas to last the 100-day span. Would love to hear you suggestions and app-ideas for each day. This is what I'm looking to get out of this challenge:
1. Improve my UI/UX skills
2. Get better at ReactJS, specifically testing

It would be awesome if you can help me find ideas for this challenge.

**UPDATE 1**
- Thanks a ton for all the great suggestions.
- After reading through the comments, I've decided to ditch the idea of one-project-a-day and instead develop one big project in 100 days.

I'm an aspiring Full Stack developer based in California. I'm trying to find Junior roles but sadly it's extremely hard because of Covid and feeling really down not getting any bites.

I'm 2 months in React and have been grinding daily, I love it. I've also been learning Redux, and then Node &amp;  MongoDB as a backend but not that comfortable with it yet but getting there.

Trying to find like minded individuals so we could cheer each other on and maybe we could collaborate with something :)

I love designing too! If anyone wants to collaborate we could build projects together that would be great!

A student came to me with this error and I remembered the time when I was creating my first project and encountered the same problem.

It happens most when we are calling data from server and using it directly in JSX. Since the format of data is not clearly visible in frontend code, we make mistakes.

Objects are not valid react children but arrays are. So for example, in this code -

    const jsobj = {"website": "reddit"};
    return (
         &lt;div&gt;{jsobj}&lt;/div&gt;
    );

we will get error but if we change it to array then -

    const jsarr = ["website", "reddit"];
    return (
         &lt;div&gt;{jsarr}&lt;/div&gt;
    );

It's perfectly valid. In fact we can use JSX as elements of array. That's why we could use map function directly in our JSX code.
