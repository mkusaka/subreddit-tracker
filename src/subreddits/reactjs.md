I have an application made of different react components. One webpage of the application I'm trying to open is showing a blank page in IE (VERSION 11)  but the same webpage when I open in chrome is showing up fine. I don't understand what the issue is.

I'm using web pack library as well.

Edit: package.json has es6: true under "env" object

I hope this is the right place this post mostly focuses on gatsby and NextJS.

I've been looking into frameworks to redo my personal website which currently is powered by just HTML and CSS and at most 200 lines of JS. I've been getting a bit into react (through gatsby and NextJS) and even after just coding up a small little demo I'm just devastated by the performance overhead react / webpack generates. It might be because I'm still very bad at writing react components, but something feels wrong when I audit a site with Lighthouse and I get a performance rating of 70. Main Thread Execution time sits at 4 seconds already and when looking at bigger sites that use these technologies auditing them yields even worse stats.

Am I not meant to audit a website built on react through Lighthouse? I always focused to getting 100 points on performance or at least as close as possible to it on my website. I really think that the link preloading of both frameworks are amazing, building websites through components seems super intuitive and some other things.

How would one approach this? Is it wrong for me to use React to build a simple website with little Javascript interaction, is it truly only meant for apps when you really want to see a difference? And especially how would I go about accurately auditing a react based website?

My family owns a small business and is finally able to do curbside pickup. My dad asked me if I could make him a site that's basically an online store without actually paying - all it will do is display items (picture, price, etc.) and put items in a cart. For checkout, it will send the store an email of the items for pickup and a confirmation page for the customer.

I've been exploring AWS Amplify to deploy and host this, but I've heard AWS can get pretty expensive. I don't anticipate many people to be logging into this site, but I want to stay pretty budget if possible.

I'm stuck on a platform that can hold a good number of images, have a database for items, and also host the frontend. I've made React apps with a postgres backend before and it was easy to make changes and develop locally since I could just run an express server in the back while making changes to my app. 

Any guidance or suggestion is much appreciated!
