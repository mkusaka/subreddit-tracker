The Jetpack Compose team is happy to announce that the Jetpack Compose dev04 drop has just been released! You can get it on Google’s Maven Repository or by upgrading your version in the latest Android Studio canary.

Compose is developed in the open, so the latest changes were always available, but we are moving to a continuous release model for binaries to make it easier to test the latest API changes.

Release notes are linked at [https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Thank you for your continued feedback, and please continue logging issues at [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=612128](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=612128).

You can also join the #compose channel on the [kotlinlang Slack](http://slack.kotlinlang.org/) to discuss with the team.

What I did wrong: I put the main keyword as a hashtag at the bottom of the description.

Don't do that.

Hey guys,I just wanted to ask for your take on this, I got into Android dev and I really like it. I contacted 2 small companies already but unfortunately  they're looking for a solution of having the app run on both android and ios.  I was afraid of this trend, and anyhow I don't have money to buy a Mac so I cannot go that route anyway.

What I wanted to ask you, do you guys find it  easy enough to get freelance gigs in native Android development? Do you think today it's suffice to stick to solely native dev?  


I know that there is always work in bigger companies, but freelancing might be a better option for me as I'm constantly changing my location.

Thanks in advance!

I like the plain old OOP way of developing android apps. The way we carefully decide what objects speak to what other objects, keeping data and behavior stuck together, etc. While it's arguably easier, it \*is\* familiar and simple. 

But I'd like to explore the FRP way of utilizing streams and functional programming constructs to build an app. While there are many tons of blogs and libraries for doing it, I wasn't able to find a good source code repository to learn from.   


Is there any reasonably decent repository of an android app written using Streams &amp; generally with reactive principles in mind?

Hi guys,

I am currently learning flutter and am therefore considering an apple device to test builds on ios. Since android development in Android Studio is as demanding as Flutter, I thought I would ask the nice community here for some advice. 

I have found a used Mac mini (late 2012) for a great price.

Problem is, the CPU is a bit dated (i5-3210M)

Would it suffice?

The machine has 16 gigs of RAM and 250 GB SSD (compared to 8 GB and 5400RPM HDD on my current machine lol) , so it is otherwise great.

Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules :)
