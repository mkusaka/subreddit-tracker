My college friends and I just finished a website that takes the top trending data from 7 platforms (movies, twitch, twitter, tv shows, reddit, spotify, youtube) and displays them in order of popularity. We wanted a way to bring the top trending content to one place so that we donâ€™t have to check multiple sites. We used Reactjs for our front-end and we were able to create some pretty fun animated components like our header and footer. 

Feel free to take a look at our site or see what we were able to create with React! Feedback is always welcome :)

Hello, I recently started trying to learn react on my own and am trying to create a small project. So im trying to make a simple template for a site. I created a component for the header and footer and put them into a layout component together, now what i am trying to figure out is how can i make other pages and bring the template into them so that when they display the header and footer are added to those components on the top and bottom of the page. Any and all help is appreciated would really like to understand how its done and any reading material on it would also help since im not sure my search results are getting me anywhere.

## [11][Getting a warning in my Jest/Enzyme test suite](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j9qqtq/getting_a_warning_in_my_jestenzyme_test_suite/)

My test suite suite has a handful of tests like this one, they all pass but they cause the warning below to show up. I have read and tried a few solutions online for a while but Im not getting anywhere.  Im not changing the state so Im not sure why the warning shows up in the first place. 

`it("Closing", async() =&gt; {`  
 `const newState = {...state, step: Step.Closing};`  
 `const tree = renderer.create(&lt;App appStore={newState}/&gt;).toJSON();`  
 `expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();`  
  `});`

Passes but triggers this warning:

 `Warning: An update to Pane inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).`

`When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):`

`act(() =&gt; {`

`/* fire events that update state */`

`});`

`/* assert on the output */`

How could I fix this?

I need help trying to figure out where to start with my project. I want to build a music library web app that allows user to add, edit, delete, and fetch all data in the table (when the homepage loads). the database will include information on each artist, including, artistName, genre, release date, record label used to fund the album, and possible much more. I want to use React for the front end, Node.js, Express for the backend and MySQL for my database. This is my first time using Express, so I don't know  fetch the data in my MySQL db table. I would like to display the results using the `&lt;TableCell&gt;`tag. I feel like I have a general idea of what needs to be done, but I'm not extremely confident when it comes to working on my own projects. I have this issues of second guessing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Any information is greatly appreciated!  Much love &lt;3

EDIT: I dont know how to properly markdown yet via Reddit. First time posting on this sub (second edit).
