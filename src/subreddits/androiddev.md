* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

[Vector drawable](https://i.imgur.com/UUUWEvz.png) was taken from developer.android directly, all my imported vector images are also broken. Does anybody encountered something like this? It's probably my local problem because there is no cry on the Internet about this. I also tried to use beta studio, but issue remains

I come from html and angular background and I have made many hybrid apps using cordova. I have been learning native android programming using Kotlin so that I can extend or create some plugins for cordova android. I also am trying to learn native app development so that I can add that to my resume.

My question is: why is android programming so verbose? Why do I have to type 10 lines of code and use adapters etc. when they could have just added a list by assigning a variable? Mind you I am writing this from my past experience.

It looks so cumbersome to even do small things like alerts, api requests for which I have to build the damn thing. And oh the crashes on different phones. My coworker is inundated with crashes and he spends so much time fixing them because of null pointer exception or redmi phones decided to not render an xml layout properly (he inherited the code from old developer). 

Is there any good reason why did google or original creators made it so verbose? Are there any google engineers here who can shed a light on this?

Basically I have an app on my phone, and I want to make a script that will open that app and press a certain button, only problem is that it seems to be impossible to unlock the phone programatically without jailbreaking my phone. So I thought that if I can debug the existing app to see the name of the button I can have it be clicked using the name without unlocking the phone. Is there any way to debug an existing app to find the names of buttons and other UI elements?
## [11][I tried to create a basic launcher. At this point in time, it implements the most basic features required in a typical launcher.
