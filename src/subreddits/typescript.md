Hi there!

How do I add custom properties on the Request object in Express, with Typescript?

I have on strict mode and need to somehow add a property on the request object so I have access to it in my controllers.

Hey, everyone!

I've been working on a compile-time safe SQL query builder/ORM for quite some time now. I **finally** have a Playground that allows you to execute both SQL and **TS** code to interact with a database! This Playground is SQLite3 only but it's a huge milestone for my project.

https://anyhowstep.github.io/tsql-sqlite3-browser/test-playground/public/

Sorry if the sample code on the Playground is contrived! But I swear the library already has a tonne of features!

There isn't documentation yet and I still have stuff to work on before publishing, but I figured I'd put up a link to the Playground, anyway, in case anyone here is interested!

And here are links to other parts of the project,
