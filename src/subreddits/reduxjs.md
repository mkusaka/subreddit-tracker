Hey I am trying to learn redux and have written this up. 

Does this make sense? Is it right? What should I change?

Hi, I'm trying to use both redux-toolkit and redux-orm in my project, and having troubles marrying the two. If anyone has links to any projects that successfully achieve that, please share!

I have a form that has 10 inputs. Is it advised to maintain this state in the component or just pass props and update through redux? What is best practice.

Hi!  
I'm implementing a website with React Redux Saga and react router. I have a few pages where I need to display some cooking recipes. The recipe details like steps, ingredients, nutritional info and other stuff comes from the back-end.  
I want to use JsonLd schemas for better SEO (yeah, I know React is not the best tool for SEO) and I'm using React Helmet to add the required meta tags to each recipe page.  
My question is: Is it bad practice to have a SEO component that connects to the redux store and when the back-end responds with the data update the JsonLd schema?  
Thanks!
