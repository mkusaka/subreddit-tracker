We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi Everyone,

I actually come from a react native background, and am starting a new Web focused project. The platform is web focused, but if I can be smart about it and develop a mobile app for it along the way, I'd like to do that.

I was just going to use React.js before stumbling on React Native Web. Are there performance downsides to using React Native Web? There has to be some sort of drawback right? Particularly on the web.

My fallback plan was to just use cordova to deploy my site mobily. That I know has far worse performance

## [12][Hoe to parse a value calculated within a component to his parent](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hd5bw5/hoe_to_parse_a_value_calculated_within_a/)

Hello,

I've a very basic question - I'm passing some data into a component and within this component I'm calculating some outputs. What I'm trying to do is to return back (reflect) a value to an attribute so that it can be used to his parent component.

Any idea???
