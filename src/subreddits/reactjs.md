## Want Help with your Code?

1. **Improve your chances** by adding a minimal example with [JSFiddle][jsfiddle], [CodeSandbox][code sandbox], or [Stackblitz][stackblitz].
    - Describe what you want it to do, and things you've tried. Don't just post big blocks of code!

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I mainly do MERN work but recently for my personal projects realized I got tired of repeating redundant code for a simple rest api. I researched Firebase and it seems to be a really good alternative, with built in authentication and real-time database. Iâ€™ve also heard people disliking it, if so why? Is it a good alternative after all?

Building [React.js projects for beginners](https://codersera.com/blog/reactjs-projects-for-beginners/) will not only allow you to strengthen up React skills but also will help you explore your creative sides as a developer. Also, it will make you familiar with **React developer tools** and react ecosystem for each project as per the need for that project.

React project development is a self-directed process. Youâ€™ll have to learn on a trial and error basis.Â Unlike the basics of React via online learning materials, thereâ€™ll not be much to guide you on building React projects.

But still, there is numerous content online that teaches the basic core steps of app development, along with the source code.Â 

As a beginner, React.js project development may seem challenging, but one can simplify the whole process by breaking down an application into smaller components. Try to focus on building one feature at a time, and keep connecting the dots as you move forward into the intricacies of development.

As you continue to practice with different React tools and ecosystems, you will understand the common patterns of app development and start identifying which tools work best for developing specific features of a React app.Â 

 By now you must be clear on requirements for building React apps. Letâ€™s start learning about a few of the best **React.JS projects for beginners** list-

Just reading through the changelog for the latest alpha release of Material UI;

[https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.11](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.11)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"It has taken 6 months of development since the initial commit (March 15th, 2020) to make the first alpha release of the grid. The component comes in two versions:  
material-ui/data-grid is licensed under MIT, while material-ui/x-grid is licensed under a commercial license."

The docs for the new component are here;

[https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/)

This is obviously great news seeing as one of the criticisms often levelled at MaterialUI is that it isn't always easy to build data heavy UIs... but I am a little concerned about the new "paid" model for the X-range of components/component features;

[https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-x/](https://material-ui.com/store/items/material-ui-x/)

Some of the features locked behind the paywall are pretty fundamental - I don't know how other people feel about this and I know that these guys have to make their money somehow, but with so many great alternative data grids out there (react-virtualized for example) I don't see how anyone would entertain paying this much money just to use the material UI native version :/

## [11][How does react render images ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j1blip/how_does_react_render_images/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j1blip/how_does_react_render_images/
---
Let's say I have two components with different routes, which both have images in them from url source. 

My question is, when loading of the image happens? At the moment when I'm going to a specific route/component which has the image, or at first render of the app everywhere?

Are there some ways to prevent defaults or some best practices, lazy loading maybe? 

I'm having some problem with an image from non-home page route, which sometimes is not loading(and sometimes it loads) and can't figure out why.

Thanks
## [12][Best practice for back button handling, URL changing, etc. in React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j1bkvg/best_practice_for_back_button_handling_url/)

Feel free to point me to an article or tutorial, but none of the tutorials I've used seem to cover this really.

I never quite know how to handle 'going back', or really even the best way to go forward in a React app.

Right now I'm working on kind of a questionnaire. There's a question on each screen. You choose your answer and click "next". Or you just click 'next' if it's just a screen with some info.

In the past, I've just stored the answer in global state and done window.setLocation, which seems wrong since that will reload the page. Otherwise I've done conditional rendering based on which questions they've answered, but that really screws with the back button. 

What is the proper way to do this? Make the 'next' button a Link to="/pagetwo" or something? and deactivate the button until they give an answer?

I've seen things like history.push, but it never got mentioned in the things I learned. Is that what people do/what I should look into?

Thanks
