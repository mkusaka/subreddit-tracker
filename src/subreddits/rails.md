It looks like this gem hasn't had any commits for over a year now. Did Netflix stop maintaining this project? Would you guys recommend using another API builder?

I would like to put Sidekiq retries into a lower priority queue. Is this possible?

I have a webapp that I made in rails a while ago and I want to share a copy of the code on a public repo (for potential use in a portfolio if I finally get the courage to try and move from hobbyist to professional).  

  

I had it on a private repo on bitbucket the whole time I developed and deployed it, and want to make sure when I make it public I'm not exposing anything. My site is verry lightly trafficed but I still wouldn't want something to happen to it and I do have a few hundred user emails in there to respect. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing's I've checked:

\-Everything in config/production.rb is using environment variables

\-secrets.yml is using an environment variable for the production secret key

\-I changed the credentials for the admin account in the db/seeds.rb (in retrospect I should have had this set with an environment variable as well)

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else I may have overlooked or should consider?
## [5][I’m taking over an app which has zero test. I installed minitest and guard but running tests is extremely slow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/i5574g/im_taking_over_an_app_which_has_zero_test_i/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/i5574g/im_taking_over_an_app_which_has_zero_test_i/
---
Every time I run the test suite or that guard detects a change, the tests take something like 45 seconds to more then one minute to start. That’s very unpractical especially since this app is quite big and has zero test written... Where should I look to try to understand and fix that first issue?

We have an existing SQLEXPRESS database that has some valuable information in it. How do I build a tunnel between rails in that server. Our primary db server is postgresql. Is it possible to establish an API based connection with that server? We simply need to read the data, and build reports with it.

---
Hello! I'm wondering if there is a clean way of keeping track of user clicks/GUI events? I am trying to flag whenever a user is active on the site. Not really concerned with what page they are on, etc. I only need to know if a user has clicked or interacted with the GUI.

Not sure how feasible this is, maybe it's possible to have a script that listens for any and all GUI events/clicks? 

I'm new to Rails and would love to hear people's thoughts on this. Open to gem suggestions.

Querida comunidad queria comentarles que hemos creado un server en Discord el cual tiene como propósito enseñar sobre programación.

Creo que la mejor forma de aprender es enseñar, por supuesto no somos formadores, quizá sabemos un poco de tecnología pero exactamente ese es el propósito de este server "Aprender" y en específico del ecosistema "Ruby y Ruby On Rails".

En el canal de voz \[Grupo de lectura\] tendremos un proyecto que trataremos de implementar por 1 hora diaria de lunes a viernes (8.00pm Colombia), donde crearemos un ERP, queremos que aprendas temas como planeación, metodologías ágiles, buenas prácticas, test, desarrollo, deploy, documentation, trabajo en remoto, cómo trabajar en equipo \[roles, responsabilidades, tiempos de entrega, etc\], la idea principal es aprender haciendo/enseñando, así que cualquier tipo de aporte que nos lleve a lograr ese objetivo es bienvenido. 

Intentaremos seguir un libro del profesor Javier Vazquez ([https://rclibros.es/producto/ruby-on-rails-aprende-a-crear-aplicaciones-web-desde-cero/](https://rclibros.es/producto/ruby-on-rails-aprende-a-crear-aplicaciones-web-desde-cero/)) que aborda el desarrollo de un software de este tipo y el cual encontrarás en el canal \[#libro\], es solo una guia como para estar en la misma página y que todos hablemos el mismo idioma, no es obligación que lo tengas para que puedas compartir en esta comunidad pero a mi te percepción será de mucha ayuda.

Desde ya te invitamos a que nos compartas que piensas de esta metodología y si es posible nos recomiendes material para ahondar mejor esa perspectiva de aprender haciendo/enseñando, siéntete libre de hacerlo en el canal \[#general\]!

The original gem is for rails 3, I can't really figure out how to make it work on Rails 6. Can somebody help?

Hi there. Trying to display hello world on my homepage to make sure my app is going to run properly. I was able to get to the Rails welcome page, but as soon as I created the first controller for the homepage I'm getting this error output:

My eyes go to those "Possible causes" it lists, but I'm not sure if that's it because I also see the Webpacker compilation failed above that. Also the error Command "webpack" not found. It's like it has multiple reasons for this error and I'm just not sure how to fix this. Any help is greatly appreciated. I made a github repo  [here](https://github.com/Kyle-Williamson-Dev/CanaBnb)
