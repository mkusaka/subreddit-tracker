This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi. I would like to get advice. I have published an app in Google Play near year ago. It is adult web sites blocker. 12.01.2020 I have submitted update and after that got email that my app was suspended with issue: “Violation of Sexually Explicit Content policy”. I have wrote to policy support team and got the answer: "...your app's screenshots currently contains links to pornography. You can refer to the attached screenshot for additional information." They have sent me the [screenshot](https://imgur.com/NuG3xy3) My answer was: "...as you can see I've used filters and there is no way to find out the correct urls of the websites", I've wrote that I can remove the screenshot or replace it, but I don't have access to my app. After that, I've got the answer: "As much as I'd like to help, I’m not able to provide any more information or a better answer to your question. In our previous email, I made sure to include all the information available to me.". I believe I had a conversation with bot, nobody reviewed my app. I have 3655 active installs and I'm using Google Pay for app’s subscriptions. My subscription plans were removed. Now I am losing old and new subscriptions every day. Is that kind of mistake? What can I do in such situation? Sorry for my English.

I still get revenue but I want users to keep my app for longer period of time. Basically it is an action game with 20 levels.

About to publish an app, I don't want to have an ads or make it paid. With that said I still want to make some money of it. So the questions is: could I include a "Donate" button. From what I can gather it's fine as long as I use google play billing instead of external parties. However, I found no definite answer regarding this problem. If anyone has experience with this particular situation, please let me know the details. Thanks!
