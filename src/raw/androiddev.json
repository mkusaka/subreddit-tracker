I\u2019m going to tell you my experience as a google play developer, and show the contrast between Google Play Developer and Apple Developer Program, to see if Google changes its unfair and absurd way of acting at once:\n\nI started as a google play developer in 2018 with some friends. We were (and have been for last) android os users, and some-kind of geek technology fans, so we decided to open a developer account and make some adventure. We learn Java in Android Studio (and then we switched to Kotlin) and started to upload apps of different categories. After a few months we discovered that our entertainment apps were the most profitable and that were the ones that were best given to us in terms of time and resources, so we started to make simple entertainment meme apps the most. So we were developing, designing and testing my apps and then uploading them, including in them both resources from internet (always fair use: deviantart, pixabay, etc) and my own resources. All was going well, my account was growing, all was great.\n\nOne day (I don\u2019t remember now) Google Play striked our account because one app was about a \u201cnuclear bomb simulator\u201d, and they argued that we were making fun with nuclear bomb tragedies (was that hiroshima and nagasaki? We will never know, because google is opaque as a gorilla in the middle of the night. Of course we typed that was a \u201dprank\u201d in the title and that was a joke in the description, but what few months ago was correct, well and policy-compliant, some day Google Play, its review team or whosoever decided it wasn\u2019t enough. You know, Google and his ridiculous way of acting and interpreting and applying policies. Of course, appealing was no use, didn\u2019t work.\n\nAnother day, some weeks later, in the middle of a global update, we received another strike email. This time was our app named \u201cLa meca de la irreverencia Button\u201d, an app which consisted of just one sound button that when pressed it consisted of a button that, when pressed, emitted the sound of the phrase \u201cLa meca de la irreverencia\u201d through the user speakers. We did it because the sentence in question was viral and a meme, and we tried to take the trend making a funny joke app. What did the the Google review team argued now? Well, that our app was a discriminatory offense. We had different options, but we obviously understood that they were talking about the \u201cmeca\u201d word, and that it was a religion discriminatory app, according to Google review team. As you see, as you can see, a great way to apply the policies, that of google.\n\nA few hours later, then, we received the typical, robotic and horrible google email announcing that we were banned and suspended forever from Google Play.\n\nIn summary: we get out of google play as a group forever because of two absurd strikes so we dissolved as a group. Appealing only served to receive more automatic robotic Google emails.\n\nNow is when it gets interesting:\n\nAfter some time, I decided as individual to try again on Google Play.  My Google Play Developer account, Paradise Meme Buttons (you can check my youtube account where I uploaded the promotional videos of my apps by searching Paradise Meme Buttons, which is still opened, no spam), were opened on November 24 of 2019, and I started uploading some apps to the store according to market trends and what I was able to do, what I made with our group before. I uploaded new apps and some similar to those I uploaded with my team before, always me making sure that no application was likely to be the object of any absurd interpretation of the policies of the google review team (although there is always risk because the interpretations, it seems, are almost endless ). All was fine now, I uploaded I think near 80 apps and they were growing.\n\nOn 5 of February of 2020 at night I finished an update of one app adding new libraries, new functionalities and new design. The libraries in question added were the following, you can see them on GitHub:\n\ncom.nightonke:boommenu:2.1.1\n\ncom.github.Shashank02051997:FancyAlertDialog-Android:0.1\n\ncom.github.GrenderG:Toasty:1.4.2\n\nThe surprise came two months later, on 6 February of 2020, when I woke up early and checked my account and i couldn\u2019t refresh the Google Play Developer Console page. After checking my internet was fine and working and fearing the worst, I checked my email and there was a no reply email from Google Play Support and with CC to the email \u201c[muzychenko@google.com](mailto:muzychenko@google.com)\u201d starting with \u201cThis is a notification that your Google Play Publisher account has been terminated.\u201d Oh, there we go again. But this time, with NO REASONS nor strikes\u2026 NOTHING. Simply they banned me without explanations,  as if I were a nuisance to eliminate. \n\nI of course appealed and investigating I found that email on CC, and searching it in Google I discovered that it belonged to \u201cOlha Muzychenko\u201d, a Google worker. I desperately wrote her explaining the situation and begging for reasons or some information. Well, I received an instantly reply from Mail Delivery Subsystem saying that \u201cAddress not found\u201d (see files attached). Really Google? The only natural person and not a robot with whom I manage to communicate throughout my life as a developer turns out that it is an email that does not exist because it left you (guess why)?\n\nI have been appealing since then requiring INFORMATION and EXPLANATIONS and saying that according to GDPR I have the right to know why the hell has been banned and suspended forever my account. One and another time but no human response, only automatic bot no-reply responses. That\u2019s all the support Google Play makes to its developers and creators: bots and emails that do not exist after banning you suddenly  forever because you are doing great and achieving downloads with no reasons.\n\nI also downloaded all my personal information that Google has about me (GDPR) in order to at once know why they closed my account, and only found basic information about the apps and logs, anymore.\n\nBy contrast, I have been an Apple Developer since as early as 2018 and I never have trouble: in Apple they are more restrictive but when you upload an app a real person responds you and tell you what is wrong or what do you have done incorrecltly with graphic indications of specific errors to fix. Moreover, they provide you with a dialogue window to discuss with the review team the interpretation of the policies they have made and why you think they are wrong, to retract if it is a mistake. They are much more serious and rigurous.\n\nFinally, I wanted to make a public appeal to Google Play and its team, so as to try to make Google realize once and not happen to anyone else:\n\nDear Google, what is wrong with you? You get money when we buy your account, you get money when we use admob or in-app purchases. Why do you decide to o make life impossible to your developers, those who maintain your store and its content, who give you money, who create value for your community? Do you think that banning and suspending forever from your store is a fair solution? Why do you interpret your own policies so absurdly? Why the only support you give to your developers is a bunch of no-reply automatic bot reply one after another saying that is impossible to help us? Are you happy making the time invested, the content, the value, the illusions and also the money fade into the fog as if nothing with just an email without explanations? Why do you explain that we have to comply with the GDPR policy when you are the first to violate it and not apply it?

I\u2019m going to tell you my experience as a google play developer, and show the contrast between Google Play Developer and Apple Developer Program, to see if Google changes its unfair and absurd way of acting at once:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started as a google play developer in 2018 with some friends. We were (and have been for last) android os users, and some-kind of geek technology fans, so we decided to open a developer account and make some adventure. We learn Java in Android Studio (and then we switched to Kotlin) and started to upload apps of different categories. After a few months we discovered that our entertainment apps were the most profitable and that were the ones that were best given to us in terms of time and resources, so we started to make simple entertainment meme apps the most. So we were developing, designing and testing my apps and then uploading them, including in them both resources from internet (always fair use: deviantart, pixabay, etc) and my own resources. All was going well, my account was growing, all was great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day (I don\u2019t remember now) Google Play striked our account because one app was about a \u201cnuclear bomb simulator\u201d, and they argued that we were making fun with nuclear bomb tragedies (was that hiroshima and nagasaki? We will never know, because google is opaque as a gorilla in the middle of the night. Of course we typed that was a \u201dprank\u201d in the title and that was a joke in the description, but what few months ago was correct, well and policy-compliant, some day Google Play, its review team or whosoever decided it wasn\u2019t enough. You know, Google and his ridiculous way of acting and interpreting and applying policies. Of course, appealing was no use, didn\u2019t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another day, some weeks later, in the middle of a global update, we received another strike email. This time was our app named \u201cLa meca de la irreverencia Button\u201d, an app which consisted of just one sound button that when pressed it consisted of a button that, when pressed, emitted the sound of the phrase \u201cLa meca de la irreverencia\u201d through the user speakers. We did it because the sentence in question was viral and a meme, and we tried to take the trend making a funny joke app. What did the the Google review team argued now? Well, that our app was a discriminatory offense. We had different options, but we obviously understood that they were talking about the \u201cmeca\u201d word, and that it was a religion discriminatory app, according to Google review team. As you see, as you can see, a great way to apply the policies, that of google.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, then, we received the typical, robotic and horrible google email announcing that we were banned and suspended forever from Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary: we get out of google play as a group forever because of two absurd strikes so we dissolved as a group. Appealing only served to receive more automatic robotic Google emails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now is when it gets interesting:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some time, I decided as individual to try again on Google Play.  My Google Play Developer account, Paradise Meme Buttons (you can check my youtube account where I uploaded the promotional videos of my apps by searching Paradise Meme Buttons, which is still opened, no spam), were opened on November 24 of 2019, and I started uploading some apps to the store according to market trends and what I was able to do, what I made with our group before. I uploaded new apps and some similar to those I uploaded with my team before, always me making sure that no application was likely to be the object of any absurd interpretation of the policies of the google review team (although there is always risk because the interpretations, it seems, are almost endless ). All was fine now, I uploaded I think near 80 apps and they were growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 5 of February of 2020 at night I finished an update of one app adding new libraries, new functionalities and new design. The libraries in question added were the following, you can see them on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;com.nightonke:boommenu:2.1.1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;com.github.Shashank02051997:FancyAlertDialog-Android:0.1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;com.github.GrenderG:Toasty:1.4.2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The surprise came two months later, on 6 February of 2020, when I woke up early and checked my account and i couldn\u2019t refresh the Google Play Developer Console page. After checking my internet was fine and working and fearing the worst, I checked my email and there was a no reply email from Google Play Support and with CC to the email \u201c[&lt;a href=\"mailto:muzychenko@google.com\"&gt;muzychenko@google.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:muzychenko@google.com\"&gt;muzychenko@google.com&lt;/a&gt;)\u201d starting with \u201cThis is a notification that your Google Play Publisher account has been terminated.\u201d Oh, there we go again. But this time, with NO REASONS nor strikes\u2026 NOTHING. Simply they banned me without explanations,  as if I were a nuisance to eliminate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I of course appealed and investigating I found that email on CC, and searching it in Google I discovered that it belonged to \u201cOlha Muzychenko\u201d, a Google worker. I desperately wrote her explaining the situation and begging for reasons or some information. Well, I received an instantly reply from Mail Delivery Subsystem saying that \u201cAddress not found\u201d (see files attached). Really Google? The only natural person and not a robot with whom I manage to communicate throughout my life as a developer turns out that it is an email that does not exist because it left you (guess why)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been appealing since then requiring INFORMATION and EXPLANATIONS and saying that according to GDPR I have the right to know why the hell has been banned and suspended forever my account. One and another time but no human response, only automatic bot no-reply responses. That\u2019s all the support Google Play makes to its developers and creators: bots and emails that do not exist after banning you suddenly  forever because you are doing great and achieving downloads with no reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also downloaded all my personal information that Google has about me (GDPR) in order to at once know why they closed my account, and only found basic information about the apps and logs, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By contrast, I have been an Apple Developer since as early as 2018 and I never have trouble: in Apple they are more restrictive but when you upload an app a real person responds you and tell you what is wrong or what do you have done incorrecltly with graphic indications of specific errors to fix. Moreover, they provide you with a dialogue window to discuss with the review team the interpretation of the policies they have made and why you think they are wrong, to retract if it is a mistake. They are much more serious and rigurous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted to make a public appeal to Google Play and its team, so as to try to make Google realize once and not happen to anyone else:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Google, what is wrong with you? You get money when we buy your account, you get money when we use admob or in-app purchases. Why do you decide to o make life impossible to your developers, those who maintain your store and its content, who give you money, who create value for your community? Do you think that banning and suspending forever from your store is a fair solution? Why do you interpret your own policies so absurdly? Why the only support you give to your developers is a bunch of no-reply automatic bot reply one after another saying that is impossible to help us? Are you happy making the time invested, the content, the value, the illusions and also the money fade into the fog as if nothing with just an email without explanations? Why do you explain that we have to comply with the GDPR policy when you are the first to violate it and not apply it? Are not consumer rights important to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you should seriously reconsider your values, your way of acting, the example you intend to give and the app store you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry not sorry, Raul, an ex Google Play developer thanks to Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can contact me for help, for telling me your case and more at [&lt;a href=\"mailto:elraulbenitoortola@gmail.com\"&gt;elraulbenitoortola@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:elraulbenitoortola@gmail.com\"&gt;elraulbenitoortola@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r26y", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "f7uynm", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cetogenicoandorra", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 27, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/androiddev/comments/f7uynm/google_developer_account_terminated_by_bots_with/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f7uynm/google_developer_account_terminated_by_bots_with/", "subreddit_subscribers": 133932, "created_utc": 1582389727.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "after": "t3_f7uynm", "before": null}}
