I've had some concerns about my project's localization workflow and am wondering what the biggest things worth changing would be in your opinion?

- react-intl

- we have an `en` localization as default, and no default messages inline in the code (because it seemed verbose). This means that we don't get automatic fallback for missing translations, and instead need to temporarily copy English strings to other locales while they're being translated. 

- All locale JSON data is imported into the bundle, no async lazy-loading. Size-wise it's not a big deal in our case, but it sure feels wrong.

- While we can send arguments, there's no _nice_ way to include some formatting and/or links without splitting texts into multiple parts. It might be nice to add markdown support to the app, but I've yet to explore it and its consequences.

Hello, community, I just recently joined here, and I'm creating this post as my first collaboration. I just hope it doesn't go against the rules but I'm really excited to help a lot of people with my videos. My last react video was about implementing firebase authentication with redux and react-router-dom. I know you guys are going to like it and I'm hopping to get questions that you may have, I'll be happy to answer them all. Check it out here: [https://youtu.be/fPDVn4UX6GI](https://youtu.be/fPDVn4UX6GI)
