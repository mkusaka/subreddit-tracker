## [4][how to import TypeScript library main function and typings from same location](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ekm021/how_to_import_typescript_library_main_function/)

I am writing a TypeScript library + an example-app, each in separate codebases. I am having trouble getting the library's main function and its typings to be accessible from its import root; I want to be able to consume the library like this:

    import myMainFunc, { InterfaceA, InterfaceB } from 'my-lib';

However, I can only import the types from my-lib, not the main func. I have an entrypoint `index.ts` containing a default export, and a `types.ts` containing all relevant types:

    src/
      index.ts
      types.ts

My package.json has

      "files": [
        "/dist/"
      ],
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "typings": "dist/types.d.ts",

and my tsconfig has

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "lib": ["es6", "dom", "es2017"],
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "declaration": true,
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "strict": true
      },
      "include": ["src"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules", "src/test/*"]
    }

The built dist directory looks like:

    dist/
      index.js
      index.d.ts
      types.js
      types.d.ts

Note: the library is not yet published, so I use `yarn link` to pull it in as a dependency to the example app.

Trying to play with generic type:


```typescript

function AorB&lt;T extends "a" | "b"&gt;(x: T) {

  const f: T extends "a" 

           ? (x: "b") =&gt; void 

           : (x: "a") =&gt; void = ((x: T) =&gt; {});



  return f

}
```

And got an error:

&gt; Type '(x: T) =&gt; void' is not assignable to type 'T extends "a" ? (x: "b") =&gt; void : (x: "a") =&gt; void'.ts(2322)

I have no idea why this happened, why TypeScript can't infer the type of the function? confused for a whole day...

Hi ðŸ‘‹ **Problem**:  I'm using es2015 modules, and targeting web browsers. When I move .ts files in VSCode, the updated module import paths will not have a .js suffix. E.g.: I had a module reference:

* "/js/event.js", upon move to a new directory, the reference was update to
* "/js/util/event"

In other [VSCode extention](https://github.com/stringham/move-ts.git)s to move and refactor files they also seem to use no suffix. I'm using IIS or the *python -m http.server* command to test my code, and these seem to have no easy way to automatically rewrite all /thing to /thing.js.

What am I missing? The servers don't seem to like the syntax VSCode gives, yet I find no way to change the settings so the refactoring retains the .js suffix. Are modules generated by typescript usually not served as .js? If so, what servers should I be using?

Sorry for the broad scope of this question, but it's causing me some issues. I've searched for the answer and also tried rewrite rules.

\---

**Update**: seems there is no easy way to alter this refactoring behavior, but using webpack might be a solution, and one that does not require a large build pipeline and loads of dependencies. Thanks guys!

**Update 2**: the following webpack command makes debugging work as well, though you get the .js source maps instead of the .ts `webpack --entry .\js\main.js -o library.js --mode development --watch --devtool source-map`
