This is mentioned [here](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape/#designing-a-normalized-state) . What I do not understand is :

1. why arrays of ids should indicate ordering for the ids ? why cant the ids themselves represent ordering ?
2. what is the profit/best practice that we get from creating one more nest in the state to just add the `allIds` property ?
3. how are the unique ids produced ?

Totally new to react and redux, so please excuse my dumb questions.
I already managed to write a component, that opens a webcam and displays it, I also managed to add a button in this component to grab an image and send it to a handler function outside of this component.

Now I would like to do the following: I would like to write a page, that grabs a pic from the webcam, sends it via fetch to a server - waits for the reply and after the reply came does the same again. Iâ€™m currently still lost how to do that within the React - redux(-toolkit) framework.

Would love to get hints on it.

I currently have an application using redux and I have it set that every time the app loads it checks the JWT token is valid and adds the user data to the state.

I was wondering what the differences are between calling the api and then storing data in the state every reload or storing the data once in `localStorage`? 

How the code is setup with calling the api and storing with redux. 

CHECK TOKEN
```
const token = localStorage.UserIdToken;
if (token) {
  const decodedToken = jwtDecode(token);

  if (decodedToken.exp * 1000 &lt; Date.now()) {
    store.dispatch(logoutUser());
  } else {
    store.dispatch({ type: SET_AUTHENTICATED });
    axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = token;
    store.dispatch(getUserData());
  }
}
```
`getUserData()`
```
export const getUserData = () =&gt; async dispatch =&gt; {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get('/user');
    dispatch({
      type: SET_USER,
      payload: res.data,
    });
  } 
  ...
};
```

Hello fellows

I have created a new alternative to the Redux library. It is much simpler and powerful. [https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux](https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux)

I would appreciate having your feedback!

Are there any best practices, guides, or libraries out there to simplify/standardize how caching is handled in Redux?

For now, I'm keeping a boolean in my reducers. If that value is false and I try to fetch data, it'll just no-op.

Hi,  


Is there a way to Dispatch this "products" array somehow to a state ?
