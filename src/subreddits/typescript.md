## [2][Which is a better pattern: `declare global` or `.d.ts` file?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fskubj/which_is_a_better_pattern_declare_global_or_dts/)

Both `declare global` and `.d.ts` files let you declare Typescript definitions globally.  But which one is a better pattern in general? 

`.d.ts` seems to make more sense since it is all in one place but I want to know what good cases there are to prefer `declare global` as well.

I built a Tetris clone with TypeScript, not quite finished but there's enough meat there to play it. Expanding my OOP knowledge, coming from a functional programming background. Enjoy!

Closures return a function that has access to private state. Typescript allows for private variables. 

Do you guys still use closures for anything? If so what are the still relevant use cases for them?

Staff like arr.map().filter().map().reduce() - can theoretically be compiled to single for loop. Should it be?  TypeScript can even give users some superset of standart   library

I want to acknowledge [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) for their work and inspiring me to write this package.

[Myzod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/myzod) is a joi like object validation library with built-in typescript support that can infer the types defined by your schemas. The purpose of myzod is to no longer have to maintain types and validation separately so that they will always be in sync.  


Here is a basic example of how the package is used:  

```
import myzod, { Infer } from 'myzod';

const personSchema = myzod.object({
  id: myzod.number(),
  name: myzod.string().pattern(/^[A-Z]/),
  age: myzod.number().min(0),
  birthdate: myzod.number().or(myzod.string()),
  employed: myzod.boolean(),
  friendIds: myzod.array(myzod.number()).nullable()
});

type Person = Infer&lt;typeof personSchema&gt;;
// same as
type Person = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  birthdate: number | string;
  employed: boolean;
  friendIds: number[] | null;
};

const person = personSchema.parse({ ... }); // here person is statically inferred with the correct type (Person)
```

Use it if you find it can be useful for you :) 
All feedback welcome.

 Hey all,

Just want to share with you my first project written in TypeScript - [https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-random-reveal](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-random-reveal). It is a small library that adds a little thrill before revealing the truth so to speak. The effect is achieved with a character animation that shows random characters before revealing the text you want to emphasize. 

I must say that I fell in love with TypeScript, the compiler helped me several times to find some issues with my code. Of course, there were a few times where the compiler and I did not agree .... but after some time it manage to convince me :)

Any feedback on the TypeScript part would be appreciated, I hope you also find it useful.

## [10][Combine multiple basic types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fscok7/combine_multiple_basic_types/)

Hello everyone,

let's say I have the following string:

&gt;'133962:22:last'

The colons are used as separators. The first two parts are always only digits, the last one is a known string value.

Now I'd like to define this as its own type, preferably by combining multiple subtypes, e.g. (pseudocode)

&gt;type knownString = 'first' | 'second' | 'last' 

&gt;type groupedType = number &amp; ':' &amp; number &amp; ':' &amp; knownString

is something like this at all possible?

Thanks!
