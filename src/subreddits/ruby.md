A while ago, I wrote a debugging tool called [tapping\_device](https://github.com/st0012/tapping_device) and received some pretty good responses here. So today I want to introduce another new tool I'm working on recently: [power\_trace](https://github.com/st0012/power_trace). 

It adds all the information we desperately need to exception backtraces:

1. Local variables
2. Method call arguments
3. Instance variables defined in the frame

And it now supports integration with `rails`, `minitest` and `rspec`

Here's an example output of the `rspec` integration

Please give it a try let me know what you think about it ðŸ˜„

While I'm not the author, I participate in both Ruqqus and Reddit and I [saw this gem there](https://ruqqus.com/post/2q92/made-a-ruqqus-api-for-ruby), which IMO is pretty well made.

I will leave the links here in case you want to contribute.

Tiny experiment ahead, I just want to concatenate strings from a collection of hashes. 

I'll share my analysis (and what I've got as the correct answer) tomorrow.

To create a collection of hashes with strings we'll use: 

```ruby
Array.new(count, { text: 'text' }) #=&gt; [{ text: 'text' }, { text: 'text' }, ... "count" times]
```

First option is a classic `map` and `join`.

The second option is a lovely `inject`.
