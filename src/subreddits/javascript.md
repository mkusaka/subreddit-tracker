Post a link to a GitHub repo that you would like to have reviewed, and brace yourself for the comments!
Whether you're a junior wanting your code sharpened or a senior interested in giving some feedback and have some time to spare, 
this is the place.

I don't understand the deprecation of window.orientation and what we are supposed to use instead to detect how a device is rotated.

The only other orentation API I can find is Screen.orientation, but iOS does not support that so you'd be left with less than 50% browser support: [https://caniuse.com/screen-orientation](https://caniuse.com/screen-orientation)
