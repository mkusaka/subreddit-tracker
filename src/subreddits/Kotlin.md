Hello respected Kotlin people
I do not know programming
I do not know coding
I do not know java, c++, python or anything

But I wanted to try learning Kotlin to make my own android apps. How do you think I will fare?

## [5][Graalvm native-image for Kotlin scripts?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hqjtiw/graalvm_nativeimage_for_kotlin_scripts/)

I feel like I've looked all over the Internet and manuals but couldn't find a solution.

**Is there a way to create a Graalvm native-image from a KTS file?**

A *regular* Kotlin program, with a main class etc. can be processed with:
&gt; kotlinc hello_world.kt -include-runtime -d main.jar
&gt; 
&gt; native-image --static -jar main.jar

But apparently kotlinc can only *interpret* a script, not compile it?

Thanks for any pointers.

I know what it says they do

[https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-dsl-marker/](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-dsl-marker/)

But I haven't actually seem them do that ;-)

I DO like how you can set the IDE to use different colors and styles for them though.

Figured I'd give Android programming a shot. I've written a LOT of Kotlin, and I've been a registered Apple Developer for years, and own pretty much everything they make.

Which device would you say represents a reference platform, maybe with the least quirks, I'm probably looking at a Tablet because I won't really use a phone.  Recommendations?
