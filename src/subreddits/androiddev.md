Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

Hi all!

I used to develop android applications in the past but the last few years I mostly worked as a backend developer. Time to time some smaller app idea came into my mind so I decided it to implement some of those in my free time to up to date my android skills. The problem is that I have 0 UI/UX skills. I mean at my workplace were UI plans to implement so it was way easier. But now I'm alone and I can't implement anything that would be as ugly as hell. So here is my question. Is there any place where talented peoples share their designs for free so I can search for something that I like and I can implement the design?  


I really like the light, flat stylized designs like [this](https://imgur.com/AKuHtHw).

I found [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/mobile) but it is paid and maybe too good. I mean I just wanna polish my skills with some hobby project. I don't want to pay a professional designer to create a 10/10 design for me. A free *kinda good* template is ok for me.  
 

Thanks for help!

Hey everyone!

I'm looking for a feedback on a simple app i created as a proof of concept regarding the Hilt library. I wonder what improvements would you make regarding the architecture design or any notes that i should keep in mind while working on my next project.

Any comment will be greatly appreciated.

I’m building an app that allows users to search train times, journeys and display details about each train etc. I have a backend web service that listens to updates for trains that users have requested to get updates for.  If it receives a message for that particular train it sends a firebase message to the associated device, if the app is in background displaying a notification makes sense.  But if the app is in foreground, should I use some other mechanism/ui element to inform the user that there has been an update, I just think that overlaying the UI while the user is already engaged with my app is a bit much, or is it the standard?
