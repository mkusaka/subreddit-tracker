This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I don't think I can ever get a brick and mortar job for android dev - not with this plague going around.

I am looking towards doing remote work on sites like Fiverr (I'm sick of the bidding wars on other sites like Upwork and Freelancer) but is it possible to find and make clients while still starting out?

What sort of apps should I make as portfolio? The one I am currently making is not really a commercial app, but just a demo.

Also, are clients still hiring during this plague season?

I know that there have been a lot of issues in the past (and probably current) of apps not showing up in the Play Store, but this is a new issue I found and am curious if anyone else has seen it. Multiple times I have searched for a key word and gotten results with the same app showing twice. I've verified that the apps are exactly the same (same package name, title, review count etc), and occurs randomly.  


These are not ads either as you can see the two ad titles at the very top of the list, these have always been below the ads. I assume Google is still working on issues with the algorithm?

Is anyone experiencing delays when trying to publish app updates?  The Google play developer console has a message saying there could be delays. I've tried releasing internal tests and beta tests and both methods haven't worked for a few days. I assumed they automated this stuff but I guess maybe not. Is anyone else seeing delays?

Stay away from appScatter Group/Airpush (renamed as Airnow). The business model of this company is to steal developers' money by not paying their earnings.
