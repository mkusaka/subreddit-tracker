Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gyswpo/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hi,

If you look up Rust for AVR on Google, most posts are from 2018 saying that there are significant problems. It's now two years later, and I was wondering what the status is now?

The only recent top hit is the [avr-rust project](https://github.com/avr-rust/rust). My concern with this is that I do not want to be using an outdated version of Rust. However, in the README.md, it says:

&gt; Vanilla rustc

&gt; AVR support is enabled by passing the --target avr-unknown-unknown flag to rustc.

&gt; Note that the Rust libcore library (essentially required for every Rust program), must be manually compiled for it to be used, as it will not be built for AVR during compiler compilation (yet). Work is currently being done in order to allow libcore to be automatically compiled for AVR.

Okay, so vanilla `rustc` can be used to target AVR, but I have to recompile libcore. So how do I do that? And does it actually work as expected? Or are there significant bugs still?
