## [3][Using a conditional filter, error still occurs: Property 'header' does not exist on type 'never'.ts(2339)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hbe5ct/using_a_conditional_filter_error_still_occurs/)

    export default abstract class StepsBase {
        protected description: string = ``;
     
        /**** Duck Typed DEFAULT Methods ****/
    
        public explain() {
            // Property 'header' does not exist on type 'never'.ts(2339)
            if ("header" in this) { console.log(this.header); }
    
            if ("description" in this) { console.log(this.description); }
        }

The lint is on the header property of `this.header`, I guess since `this` points back to this class definition.

I thought my if statement would tell the interpreter to only type check inside that control flow block if the condition passed.

I also tried the following type assertions but both failed:

            if ("header" in this) { console.log(this.header as unknown); }
            if ("header" in this) { console.log(this.header as any); }

This is meant to be a base class where some inheriting subclasses define their own `header` and `description` properties. How should the base class be setup to pass type checking? I can leave an empty default value for `header` as I did for `description`, but I would like to know the best practice (maybe it is exactly that).

I see the syntax for generics is:

    function doX &lt;T&gt; (args: T): T {...}

And sometimes there is a word in front:

    function doY &lt;T&gt; (args: Array&lt;T&gt;): Partial&lt;T&gt; {...}

I know what these represent. `Array` specifies an array of values of type `T`. `Partial` is a utility type that specific some k/v pairs of the generic are there, but not all are required.

My understanding is not complete. I understand  `Array` and `Partial` are modifiers of a generic type... but how exactly? Are they keywords? Can I make my own? Do they, as a whole, have a deeper syntactical structure (`Partial.If` for example)?

Any help clarifying what that syntax is exactly is appreciated, thanks.
## [5][Help needed with error 'Argument of type 'any' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.'](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hb90fk/help_needed_with_error_argument_of_type_any_is/)

Hi! I've been stuck on this error all day: Argument of type 'any' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.

 I am using Object.entries(constraints).forEach(([k, v]) =&gt; strConstraint[k as keyof StringValidator](v)) to loop over a constraints object which can contain any combination of the following: 
maxChars?: number; minChars?: number; regexToValidate? RegExp; equals?: string; notEquals?: string;. 

Here is the code for my stringValidator (error on line: 232) https://codesandbox.io/s/festive-bartik-6hdhm?file=/index.ts. If maxChars method (97-103) of number type is commented out, it works fine. 

As a last resort, I could parse a string to a number which works since everything is a string then. Any thoughts?

Hi.  I want to create a private class within a class.
```ts
class Foo {
  private class Bar extends Baz {
    ‚Ä¶
  }
}
```
But as of TypeScript 3.9.5, it is not possible.  How do I implement that in a non-hacky sane manner?

I have interfaces and classes which are rather cumbersome and, for various reasons, require creating "default" forms; for example, the strings need to be initialized to empty strings, the numbers need to be initialized to 0, the arrays need to be initialized to [], etc.

Can anyone point me in the direction of information on how best to accomplish this? I tried looking at the "ts-transformer-keys" package but ran into the same error about "ts_transformer_keys_1.keys is not a function" people have reported from time to time.

Thanks in advance.
