We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

It is a website with information given only in german so it makes sense I guess. The topic is about web accessibility and I would appreciate it if a lot of diverse people would test the page (of course this can't be forced lol).

Btw. The website is created with React and the Material UI library was being used.

This the procedure of your testing:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQSktM-2NCPXksuHAX12zIS9iCrHtEdRfx8hgvHI4UA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQSktM-2NCPXksuHAX12zIS9iCrHtEdRfx8hgvHI4UA/edit?usp=sharing)

And this is the survey:

[https://forms.gle/3U4ptLWaviRqUDmFA](https://forms.gle/3U4ptLWaviRqUDmFA)

Pls read the procedure first.

If you have any suggestion where I can post my request, too, to gain as many people as possible regarding the topic accessibility on the web, would be really helpful!

Hello, I'm wrapping the html input with date type in a custom component to make my own datepicker.

Currently I'm trying to open the input's date picker through a ref to said input but I cannot find any method to do that. Anyone knows how the picker is displayed when clicking on the default picker icon?
