We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi everyone! I'm working on a React project that uses Context for state management instead of Redux. Can anyone review my project with their thoughts?

Project: [github.com/junnac/pomoplan](https://github.com/junnac/pomoplan)

Feel free to use [@vinylemulator](https://www.reddit.com/user/vinylemulator/)'s [codecomments.dev](https://codecomments.dev/) to provide comments for the files!

I've been trying to research best practices for implementing Context with hooks to refactor my project. The React docs demonstrate a basic implementation to explain the API, but there are no notes about best/common practices. I've seen the following approaches:

* Creating custom hooks for accessing a context value
* Directly interfacing with the Context from within a consuming component by accessing the context value with `useContext`
* Managing the Context value with `useState` in the context provider component
* Managing the Context value with `useReducer`
* Creating container components (similar to Redux container components created via the [connect()](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) function)

Any and all feedback is super appreciated! Thank you!!

Please take a look, gimme some love if you feel like it or some constructive criticism.

Thank you all!
