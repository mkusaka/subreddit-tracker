It's basically a virtual OS, written in C++, very powerful and very clean.\n\nBuilt on top of CIDLib is my CQC automation platform, which is an even bigger (about 650K'ish lines of code), full on, commercial quality home/business automation system. This is something I tried to make a success of for a long time, but ultimately have failed, after sacrificing the bulk of my adult life.

Ultimately, it ended up being an amazing product that just didn't have a commercial market. It's too powerful (aka complex) for the hoi polloi to really be interested in it. It's very well suited technically for professionally installed systems, but there are a number of big players in that space and no way to break into it without big investment that was never going to materialize.\n\nThe folks who would be potential customers were mostly folks who won't spend a dime if they can avoid it, i.e. more technical hobbyist types.

I'm moving towards open sourcing it. It may be another month before I'm ready since I have to do things like strip out all of the licensing stuff and make various other tweaks, get the docs updated to reflect those changes, get a repo set up up, build environment documented, etc...\n\nBut, I'm heading in that direction and anyone who might be interested in contributing to it as an open product would probably want to be getting familiar with it as a product before trying to contribute as a developer so that you know what it is and how it works. The current commercial version has a 40 day trial period so it should be good until the open source version arrives.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/user/CharmedQuarkSystems](https://www.youtube.com/user/CharmedQuarkSystems)\n\n[https://www.charmedquark.com/](https://www.charmedquark.com/)\n\nUltimately, because CQC is built on top of CIDLib, which is incredibly powerful (as evidenced by the fact that I, a single person, could create such a massive product with it), it could be a lot more than an automation system. It really could become a home IT infrastructure system in general. With some more resources it could go in a number of directions.\n\nCurrently it is Windows only (in terms of the back end and system management UI, there's a web based touch screen client in addition to the Windows client.) But CIDLib it highly portable. It was designed from day one to support Windows and Linux and actually used to support Linux. And I mean in a very clean way, not conditional code all over the place. That's why it was created as a virtual OS type system.\n\nSo, if some Linux folks got on board, we could get the back end cleanly supporting Windows and Linux in a heterogenous network way. I got started on resurrecting the Linux platform support but my Linux skills sort of bottomed out. I have my own build infrastructure which seamlessly supports both platforms, and inherently understands the needs of CIDLib and CQC. This makes it easy to develop on both. I use Visual Studio Code since it's equivalent on both, but that's not a requirement.\n\nAnyhoo, if anyone is interested, start delving into it as a user. I'm going to eat the cost of keeping the web site and forums up.

I&amp;#39;m moving towards open sourcing it. It may be another month before I&amp;#39;m ready since I have to do things like strip out all of the licensing stuff and make various other tweaks, get the docs updated to reflect those changes, get a repo set up up, build environment documented, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, I&amp;#39;m heading in that direction and anyone who might be interested in contributing to it as an open product would probably want to be getting familiar with it as a product before trying to contribute as a developer so that you know what it is and how it works. The current commercial version has a 40 day trial period so it should be good until the open source version arrives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/CharmedQuarkSystems\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/CharmedQuarkSystems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.charmedquark.com/\"&gt;https://www.charmedquark.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, because CQC is built on top of CIDLib, which is incredibly powerful (as evidenced by the fact that I, a single person, could create such a massive product with it), it could be a lot more than an automation system. It really could become a home IT infrastructure system in general. With some more resources it could go in a number of directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently it is Windows only (in terms of the back end and system management UI, there&amp;#39;s a web based touch screen client in addition to the Windows client.) But CIDLib it highly portable. It was designed from day one to support Windows and Linux and actually used to support Linux. And I mean in a very clean way, not conditional code all over the place. That&amp;#39;s why it was created as a virtual OS type system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if some Linux folks got on board, we could get the back end cleanly supporting Windows and Linux in a heterogenous network way. I got started on resurrecting the Linux platform support but my Linux skills sort of bottomed out. I have my own build infrastructure which seamlessly supports both platforms, and inherently understands the needs of CIDLib and CQC. This makes it easy to develop on both. I use Visual Studio Code since it&amp;#39;s equivalent on both, but that&amp;#39;s not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, if anyone is interested, start delving into it as a user. I&amp;#39;m going to eat the cost of keeping the web site and forums up. I&amp;#39;ll start a new section on the forums for development discussion, so you can sign up there and ask questions, make suggestions, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Charmed Quark Systems", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi27", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "hti9zs", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dean_Roddey", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 55, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/cpp/comments/hti9zs/open_sourcing_my_cqc_automation_platform/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hti9zs/open_sourcing_my_cqc_automation_platform/", "subreddit_subscribers": 145865, "created_utc": 1595085583.0, "num_crossposts": 2, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "cpp", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_10z7ay", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What's in a function pointer?
