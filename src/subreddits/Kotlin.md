First off, I apologize if this has been asked 100 times before.  I searched and found lots of questions, but none that seemed exactly in my sweet spot.

I am a experienced web developer (mostly React on the front end &amp; node/rails on the backend) and am an aws solutions architect who has had almost zero exposure to mobile other than PWAs and playing with React Native.  I have a couple ideas that I'd like to try to build and figured it would be a good chance to dip my toes in the mobile waters.

I'd love any advice on resources/books/courses/videos to get me started as someone who doesn't need an intro to programming and OO &amp; functional techniqures, but does need an intro to mobile and Kotlin.  Also, as an aside, I have ZERO java experience, and I am wondering if Kotlin is the way to go, or am I going to need to learn java at some point anyway?

Thanks for any and all the help.  I'm in a state of analysis by paralysis in getting started.

I want to try Tornadofx with Kotlin. But I haven't found any step by step tutorial. Seems like Kotlin is still a new language :/

If anyone can help me with Tornadofx then it will be very helpful !!

Hi everyone, I tried Ktor with my pet project and it was a pretty interesting experience. It was something new after 3 years of using spring, my questions are:
1) Is it anyone who using ktor in production, and what is your opinion?
2) How to persuade the management(CTO, team leads) to start using Ktor?

Hey guys 

I am Starting soon a new job with Kotlin as server side technology with Spring boot.

I was wondering if there are out there "reference books" like we had with Java, " Effective Java"

I checked on amazon there is Head First Kotlin..that would be my first choice for now..but I am open to hear other suggestions from you..either books or video tutorials..

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks !
