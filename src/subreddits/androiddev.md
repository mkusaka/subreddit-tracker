Hi guys , I created a small Android application to search images on Reddit. Just search for a subreddit and the top images will be shown (they can also be saved). The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices using modern Android development tools.

Project characteristics:

* 100% Kotlin
* MVVM
* Repository Pattern
* A single activity architecture (Navigation component)
* Android Jetpack
* Coroutines &amp; Flow
* Reactive UI
* Testing
* Dependency Injection (Koin)
* Gradle Kotlin DSL
* Material Design

Hope it can be of help or inspiration for someone!

In the rapidly evolving situation with Huawai's divorce from Google Play Services, has anyone had any luck converting an app that relies on Firebase Cloud Messaging to receive messages on newer Huawei phones that don't have Play Services on them? 

If so, what were your experiences? Did you end up changing your backend to emit Huawei Push Kit messages or is there some hack that lets you continue to register for Firebase? Looking around on the Web there are a number of discussions from this summer suggesting that the trouble starts when you notice one day that your app is no longer obtaining Firebase IDs...

Hi, 

I was wondering how other developers deal with having multiple themes in their apps, now that   
Material Components and DayNight are widely used?

It's easy when you have a light and a dark version, since you can handle everything with minimal code through AppCompatDelegate. But let's say you want light, dark and AMOLED. Or a couple of variations for each. What is the best approach?

This is how I did:

\- I have my main theme: MyStyle, inheriting from DayNight, representing light and dark.

\- I have another one: MyStyle\_amoled, inheriting from MyStyle, with attributes override only in the dark version to make it AMOLED.

This way it follows the system toggle when changing from light to dark, and in the settings, the user can choose the type of dark mode to get, Default or AMOLED.

This is ugly IMO, since you still have to make a base activity class overriding OnCreate() and OnResume() and use setTheme() accordingly. And your user clicking the back button will see the theme changing for a split second as it recreate().

Is there a better way?

It would be nice to manage themes through qualifiers having: -light, -night, -amoled, -version3... folders in your res/ and then just bind the qualifier you choose to the system setting.

I am working on an app that will send notifications to the user at a specific point in time defined by the user. So it will remind a user with 15 minutes before an event is happening. I've tried using AlarmManager and a BroadcastReceiver to send the notification, but it doesn't work when the app is closed. Do you have any idea or recommendation on what I should check?

I removed Admob an year ago because they suddenly started giving me very bad CPC ($0.05-0.1) for USA.

I use FAN and here's what I get for USA users (Android only):

* Interstitials

CPC = $0.54

eCPM = $9.12


* Banner

CPC = $0.27

eCPM = $0.49

I was wondering what Admob provides to see if FAN is paying good?
