**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft?

Hello,

I initially added a valgrind memcheck build, a few years ago, on my professional project.As the years passed, I started to create an HTML report so the developers could analyze valgrind's memcheck tool report with more ease. I added colored highlights for that.

A few month ago I thought "Hey that might interest other people !". So I started the memcheck-cover project.My goal was to start from scratch and improve the ideas I put on my professional build.

I decided to create two scripts.The first one would be a helper to make it easy to run a binary under Vilgrind's memcheck tool and get the report.The second one would be the more complicated one: the HTML report generator.

I went trough Valgrind 3.15.0 sources to find as much information as I can and started to build the scripts.

I'm proud (if I may) to present you the 1st release of my project.Here is the link : [https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/releases/tag/release-1.0](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/releases/tag/release-1.0)

Here is a demo : [https://david-garcin.github.io/demos/memcheck-cover/index.html](https://david-garcin.github.io/demos/memcheck-cover/index.html)

Don't hesitate to try it, share it, suggest improvements to it and open issues :)

Thanks,

## [7][Why you don't use Boost](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gfowpq/why_you_dont_use_boost/)

I have a question for you: If you have decided not to use any of Boost, or are prohibited from doing so in your company/project, I would like to know why.

This thread is not meant to judge your reasons, and I won't engage into any kind of criticism about them: I'm merely trying to understand what the barriers are to adoption of Boost. It would be great if we could keep the conversation non judgemental. Thank you!

You may have noticed the ongoing discussion on [why people don't use Boost](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gfowpq/why_you_dont_use_boost/). Now for the opposite question.

I'm not asking why Boost is used because the answer is relatively uninformative: one uses a lib primarily because it provides the required functionality. But using Boost (or any other lib, for that matter) means a commitment to it for the duration of the project. So, the question is:

If you are using Boost in your project(s)/company, why have you/your company decided it is OK to commit to this long-term dependency?

I won't delve into commenting/criticizing your answers, it's info I'm looking for, particularly in comparison to the "negative" thread going on in parallel. Please keep the conversation neutral, thank you!

We are always looking for ways to improve the utility of the libraries and code that we publish. In my latest project, Boost.JSON (not yet part of Boost) I have incorporated positive and negative feedback about Boost to structure the library in a way that users may find compelling. I'm interested to know what folks think about these design choices:

* The library only requires C++11
* The library is statically or dynamically linked by default.
* Build scripts are provided for both CMake and Bjam/B2 (Boost.Build)
* None of containers (`json::value`, `json::object`, `json::array`, and `json::string`) are class templates. This allows the function definitions to go into the compile library and reduce compile times (since the function definitions are not seen in users' translation units).
* The library may be used as a header-only library by defining `BOOST_JSON_HEADER_ONLY` and simply including the desired header files.
* The library normally uses `boost::string_view`, `boost::error_code`, and other Boost versions of C++ facilities. However, the library can be used completely independently of Boost simply by defining `BOOST_JSON_STANDALONE`. In this configuration, C++17 or later is required, and the std equivalents (such as `std::string_view`) will be used instead of the Boost ones.
* Another way to link with this library is to just include `&lt;boost/json/src.hpp&gt;` in any one of your .cpp files (including an empty .cpp file). You can use this to easily set up your own build script for generating a static or dynamic library.
* To support allocators, the containers use a smart pointer container that holds a `boost::container::memory_resource` (or `std::pmr::memory_resource` if standalone). This allows user-defined allocators without turning everything into a class template.

These changes are designed to address the most common complaints of Boost libraries: fast build times, easy to integrate into a project, works with regular std types, does not require the rest of Boost in order to work, easy to use.

The library is here: [https://github.com/CPPAlliance/json](https://github.com/CPPAlliance/json)

Glad to answer any questions, thanks for listening!
