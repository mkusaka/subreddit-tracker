As part of my new year's resolutions I want to get a little less camera shy and I thought I have a somewhat interesting story to share about being the solopreneur owner of a web app. This opens up the possibility to show all the code/analytics etc. without repercussions from any other stake-holders.

In terms of priorities, I wanted to ask you all what topics would you like to see covered? Here are some initial ideas I had. Feel free to add anything you don't see here.

(FYI: The site is a two-sided marketplace selling Word documents )

**Coding Topic Ideas**

1. generating a maximally enjoyable development environment (e.g. seeding data, simulating cron, mirroring production as much as possible etc.)
2. removing brittleness from integration tests that run on circleci
3. dealing with the shitshow that is sales tax accounting across multiple currencies
4. detecting and recovering from production bugs asap
5. dealing with the real-world mess that is imperfect user input (e.g. when they type emails with a leading space or inconsistent capitalization; when they create a tag that is almost the same as a previous one — like E Guitar vs. Electric Guitar—and now your data is split across two areas)
6. discussing the 8+ year consequences of certain architectural/software design issues
7. streamlining massive amounts of config
8. multi-redundant systems of backup to prevent disaster
9. designing error messages and a logging strategy that speeds up recovery from errors
10. a tour of the most evil, insidious bugs I dealt with over the years (I keep a diary for them)
11. payment systems in-depth (refunds, errors etc.)
12. caching systems for performance
13. Javascript frameworks — why I decided to tear mine out and stick with simple, modular JS.
14. Choosing dependencies that don't come back and bite you in the ass (think about how the JSscape has changed in the last ten years...)

**Marketing/Business Topics Ideas**

1. how I use data to decide to add/remove a feature
2. AB testing a web app
3. technical SEO (microdata, site structure for internal links, google's tools, sitemaps, etc.) — I get 85% of my traffic (and therefore revenue) from SEO, so I know a thing or two
4. how I use JS and integration tests on all tracking code (critical to get right in my business)
5. auto-email systems to previous customers for extra sales
6. Adwords workflow to drive revenue
7. Analytics workflow to figure out what content working
8. Writing copy that gets sales (what worked for me vs. didn't)

Hi all,  
my brother and I had this (crazy?) idea and started working on it a year ago, just finished first prototype (not yet runnable on your machine, but you can check out demo on our page).

Although we are still very early and there is a lot of work to be done to get it to something complete, we are excited about it :D and would love to hear whether you think this makes sense as a concept, can you see yourself using this, what do you think would be the most important thing to change / focus on / drop in the future, and similar - any feedback helps really!

Our webpage: [https://wasp-lang.dev](https://wasp-lang.dev) .  


Thanks a lot!

What they should improve about Javascript that you find in others programming language like C#, JAVA, C++, PHP, RUBY etc or is there things you would change or do differently if it was up to you ? I mean anything like toolings, syntax, frameworks, npm ecosystem, node, vanilla js syntax compared to the latest features etc. Do you agree with the way JS evolve and the way it's run or you would prefer a big corporation like Microsoft or a c++ standard committee running it ?
