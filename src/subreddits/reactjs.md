Thee solution si know of so far is localStorage (dangerous to store), sessionStorage (good alternative but user might need to log in with every new tab), or use cookies (which i think is good but it doesn't have enough storage for jwt so might need to use a few to store the jwt + its sent with each request so its generating lots of unnecessary traffic"

&amp;#x200B;

so far im thinking storing it in httponly cookies even though it will generate unnecessary traffic and its the old way of doing things.  but i also read here:

[https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/#:\~:text=Local%20storage%20is%20inherently%20no,the%20use%20of%20local%20storage](https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/#:~:text=Local%20storage%20is%20inherently%20no,the%20use%20of%20local%20storage). 

that cookies and localstorage are both bad so would it be better to store in localstorage? this is a headache. r there any other ways im not aware of?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How do sites like reddit, twitter, and all other websites use for authentication? where do they store in the client?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;



Edit: I think storing jwt in a httponly cookie and sending it to the client and setting up some flags make cookies very secure + jwt lets me not track sessions which increases response times.

getPokemonByOwner gets an array of ints \[0,1,2,3,4,5\] asynchronously (value below was evaluated just now) and getPokemonDetails uses each int.  I get the error(Cannot read property 'getPokemonDetails' of undefined)  


If i remove getPokemonByOwner and manually made an array \[0,1,2,3,4,5\] the function would work since theres only one async function. I tried to async twice but it doesnt work. Anyone know how to fix this?

What is this in the new CRA 4 ?

importÂ reportWebVitalsÂ fromÂ './reportWebVitals';

Is it replacing something that existed in CRA 3 / React 16 ?

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed the new template also does not have:

 registerServiceWorker

What is the replacement for this ?
