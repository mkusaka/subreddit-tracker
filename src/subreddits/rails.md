The business that Iâ€™m designing for has a lot of stubborn, crotchety customers, and in this new infrastructure, Iâ€™m trying to save the employees as much time as possible by empowering customers (who donâ€™t know how to search their email, or google a tracking number, or make it two clicks past a login page).

Whatâ€™s the best way for including params in a link that then update the value of an input?

I feel like I could just sit down and build a param trigger to render JS and put logic in a js.erb file, but something in my gut is saying that tailoring to unique params situations is usually a job for a pack full of jquery

I have a model say \`Item\` which has a method called on \`after\_commit\` but at the same time, the item model also has an Observer called \`ItemObserver\`. The observer also has an \`after\_commit\` callback which resets the cache.

Now my issue is on the update of the \`item\` model the \`after\_commit\` on the model is called first before the \`after\_commit\` on the observer hence the cache isn't reset and the \`after\_commit\` runs on stale data learning to invalid actions.

I wanted to know if it's possible to force the observer's \`after\_commit\` to run first so that is refreshed with the latest portal for all subsequent callbacks.
## [3][Is it poor form to have to supply an array as an argument to initialize, even if there's only one object in the array?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/guv73y/is_it_poor_form_to_have_to_supply_an_array_as_an/)

Hi all,

I have a class which is initialised with 3 arguments.

`def initialize(arg1:, arg2:, array_of_objects:)
  @arg1 = arg1
  @arg2 = arg2
  @array_of_objects = array_of_objects
end`

My code requires that I run a method on each object in my_class_instance.array_of_objects. There can be one or more objects in that array.

At the moment I'm initializing like this:

`MyClass.new("foo", "bar", [MyOtherClass.new])`

If I don't do it this way, then when I try to run .each on the array_of_objects, it throws an error.

Is this bad practice? And if so, how should I be supplying n number of objects to the initialize method?

Thanks and apologies for the formatting, I only have access to my phone right now.

Just got a freelance offer from them stating a budget and what they need. It's a static informational site which I'm hoping to code top-bottom from scratch. More for practice, though I could just as easily go with a hosting service like GoDaddy, WordPress, Wix, etc. by the looks of it. Curious if anyone has experience with this and knows more or less how I should handle billing to make sure everything plays out well for both parties. Rails related because I'm enjoying using rails and want to bring a hammer to do a scissor's job.

## [7][How to rescue custom exceptionin transaction block while still rolling back everything?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/guk18l/how_to_rescue_custom_exceptionin_transaction/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/guk18l/how_to_rescue_custom_exceptionin_transaction/

Suppose I would like to add a condition inside a transaction block which would raise an exception that would be raised, rescued, but I would still like all previous saves to be rolled back:

    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
        object1.save!
        object2.save!
        if condition_is_met
            raise CustomNameStandardError.new error_msg_string
        end
        object3.save!
    rescue CustomNameStandardError =&gt; e
        flash[:danger] = e.message
        redirect_to page
    end

with defining CustomNameStandardError within the same controller class like so

    class CustomNameStandardError &lt; StandardError; end

This will not rollback saves to object1 and object2. This is because by rescuing the exception I do not trigger rollback. How can I trigger rollback, but still be able to redirect myself back to the current page with an error message?

**EDIT: I found the answer and should have read the docs carefully. Apperantly raising ActiveRecord::Rollback does exactly what I wanted in my post:**

    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
        object1.save!
        object2.save!
        if condition_is_met
            flash[:danger] = error_msg_string
            raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
        end
        object3.save!
        redirect_to success_page
    end
    
    redirect_to where_i_came_from

Hey there Rails community! I am building a beginner web app . 

The app contains users that register/log in (using devise) and bus tickets that are shown on the welcome page. Everyone can see the bus tickets, but only users that are registered+logged in can buy (its fake buying :D). Additionally, users that have bought the ticket have the option to cancel it (no later than 1 hour before bus starts).

The tricky part here for me is how to display the tickets that the user already bought, and then to add the option of cancelling. I thought maybe to add a third table that would connect users and tickets, and then display that on the "My tickets" page? Not sure how to accomplish that. 

If anyone could chip in with a bit of advice I would be really grateful! Thanks guys.

tickets(bus:string, time:datetime, quantity:integer, price:integer)
users (standard devise table with email, password and so on)
## [9][How can I sort an array of hashes into separate arrays based on key value uniqueness?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/gu8nmc/how_can_i_sort_an_array_of_hashes_into_separate/)

Hi all,  


Having trouble implementing a coding challenge.  


So I have an array of objects:

    [{
        :color=&gt;"red",
        :fruit=&gt;"apple"
      },
      {
        :color=&gt;"green",
        :fruit=&gt;"pear"
      },
      {
        :color=&gt;"red",
        :fruit=&gt;"tomato"
      }]

Now, I want to sort this into separate arrays so that I can count the number of fruit of each color. So in this case I'll have one array with `apple` and `tomato`, and another with `pear`.  


One additional catch is that I can have infinite fruit to sort, and I can have infinite different colors represented by the fruit, and I don't know what those colors will be. So this method needs to be dynamic enough to handle that.  


I just need it to recognise each unique color which is present in the objects within the array, and then put them in a corresponding array of other fruits of that unique color. So desired output will in this case be:  


    [
      {
        :color=&gt;"red",
        :fruit=&gt;"apple"
      },
      {
        :color=&gt;"red",
        :fruit=&gt;"tomato"
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        :color=&gt;"green",
        :fruit=&gt;"pear"
      }
    ]


Hope this makes sense.  


Thanks

I took something I learned with rails and revisited JavaEE recreating the rails crud with JSF, it is not fashionable but seems better than nowaday development.  Rails developers can identify what I did here?  [JSF-PERFECT-CRUD](https://github.com/lazaronixon/jsf-perfect-crud)
