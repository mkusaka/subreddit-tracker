One of my biggest gripes with microservices is how few full-blown tutorials are available for something that is such a hot-topic technology.

As such, I recently built a rather simple Classifieds app using a Microservices architecture, using the following technologies as a non-exhaustive list:

* React;
* Redux;
* Node.js;
* GraphQL;
* Docker (and Docker Compose); and
* Styled Components,

And also deployed it into AWS using Terraform.

Here's the link to the full source code: [https://github.com/parkroolucas/microservices-demo](https://github.com/parkroolucas/microservices-demo)

And here's the link to the full tutorial series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-WutJH0qc&amp;list=PLnTRniWXnjf8YC9qJFLSVCrXfS6cyj6x6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-WutJH0qc&amp;list=PLnTRniWXnjf8YC9qJFLSVCrXfS6cyj6x6)

## [9][Custom Hook: return multiple getters (and no setter) ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/el8t6d/custom_hook_return_multiple_getters_and_no_setter/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/el8t6d/custom_hook_return_multiple_getters_and_no_setter/

Hi all,

What is the customHook convention to only return multiple getters (and no setter) ?

No setter because it is not needed

    export const useSitesContainer = () =&gt; {
        const [siteName, setSiteName] = useState('')
        const [sites, ] = useSites()
        const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false)
    
        useEffect(() =&gt; {
            if(!loaded) {
                getSites()
                setLoaded(true)
            }
        }, [sites])
    
        let sitesContainer = useMemo( () =&gt; {
            return &lt;SitesSelect sites={sites} setSiteName={setSiteName} /&gt;
        }, [sites])
    
        return [siteName, sitesContainer]  // &lt;--- multiple getters, no setter returned
    }

Recently i take Stephen Grinder "Modern React With Redux" Course. And i am now at middle stage. I find out Redux is super hard to understand and write code. 

What you guys think? And any suggestions for me??
