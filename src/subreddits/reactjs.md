## [4][What's the scope of "this" in a React class component? (or: why do we need "bind")](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j37xsk/whats_the_scope_of_this_in_a_react_class/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j37xsk/whats_the_scope_of_this_in_a_react_class/
---
I am learning React and modern Javascript at the same time, and I've stumbled upon the problems with "this" and implicit scoping. I understand now (I think!) how the rules around "this" apply in vanilla Javascript, but I still don't understand how they apply in the context of React.

Let me explain. Let's take this vanilla Javascript code:

    class Bla {
      constructor() {
        this.valor = 100;
        }
    
      Calcula(a) {
        console.log(this.valor + a)    
       }
    
      Render() {
        this.Calcula(66); 
       }
    }
    
    var blaInstance = new Bla;
    var a = blaInstance.Render;
    a();
    

I understand why this doesn't work: we are calling a() from the global scope, so "this" refers to the global scope, not to the object.

Now let's take a React example:

    class Foo extends React.Component{
       constructor( props ){
          super( props ); 
          }
       handleClick(event){
          console.log(this);
          }
       render(){
          return (
            &lt;button type="button" onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt; 
            );
          }
        }
    
    

In this code, aren't we calling handleClick() within the context of render(), which is inside the class? If that's the case, why doesn't it work? What's the scope from which handleClick() is triggered?

## [7][The correct way to handle redux state](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j353gs/the_correct_way_to_handle_redux_state/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j353gs/the_correct_way_to_handle_redux_state/
---
Hello guys, I would like to know if it is the right way to handle the redux state or not. 

As you can see in the below codes the `mapLat`, `mapLng` props received through redux and the `lat`, `lng` also handled by `onChange` event. But i am not sure that my if condition is the right way to set state from properties.

&amp;#x200B;

    const TestWrapper = ({ mapLat, mapLng } ) =&gt; {
    
        const [lat, setLat] = useState('')
        const [lng, setLng] = useState('')
    
        if ( lat === "" &amp;&amp; mapLat !== "" ) {
            setLat(mapLat)
        }
        if ( lng === "" &amp;&amp; mapLng !== "" ) {
            setLng(mapLng)
        }
    
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;input type="text" name="lat" value={lat} onChange={e =&gt; setLat(e.target.value)} /&gt;
                &lt;input type="text" name="lat" value={lng} onChange={e =&gt; setLng(e.target.value)} /&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
    
    const mapStateToProps = state =&gt; {
        const map = state.gmap
        return {
            mapLat: map.lat,
            mapLng: map.lng
        }
    }
    
    const Test = connect(mapStateToProps)(TestWrapper);
    
    export default Test;
