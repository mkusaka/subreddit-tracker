* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hola Subredditroids !

Hope you are all having a great Monday, I introduce to a quick recipe to automation, it can save you a lot of time searching, and implementing, it is a recipe that I have been improving for sometimes, but it have proved reliable for us in the Android team for the past 1.5 years, in a large old codebase.

This recipe is a combination of two configuration files, for CircleCI and Fastlane, I have provided comments over the commands that I think could be a tricky a bit and not straightforward (Like how to manage files necessary for providing new builds that are not tracked in your VCS).

Let me know in the comments if you need help or further clarification. Also I haven't added the testing execution commands, but the idea here is to give the fundamentals needed for a proper kickoff.

I might update this configuration in the long term with more useful commands that can aid with the whole automation script (Publishing to google play, running unit/instrumentation tests, release notes management).

If this seems beneficial to you, a star would be appreciated.

I recently started learning about user authentication, so things like sessions, JWT, OAuth, etc.

I noticed that for a lot of account based apps (mainly apps like Snapchat, Facebook, etc.) I'm never logged out on my Android device. I'm assuming they use a token based authentication scheme and if I'm never logged out does that mean the token never expires?

Is it stored in local storage? Aren't there security concerns with this approach?

I would like to hear your thoughts as maybe I'm misunderstanding this issue.
## [8][Process being killed on Android 10 but not on Pie](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hhupfk/process_being_killed_on_android_10_but_not_on_pie/)

There's an existing application where gets  launched at device boot. On Pie everything is ok, however on 10, about couple minutes or so after the app has started the process is being killed. There's no indication in logcat that there's any exceptions, the only  thing that is logged when the process is killed is this line:

"I/ActivityManagerï¹• Killing 2390:com.company.E/u0a813 (adj 999): empty for 2400s"

Any idea what "empty for 2400s" might mean if its anything significant. Or any suggestions how I can find out why its being killed?

## [11][Is there a documentation guide for writing comments in Kotlin on Android Studio?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hhmix6/is_there_a_documentation_guide_for_writing/)

I'm currently working on an Android app using Kotlin. When I used to write programs in Java on Eclipse, I followed this [Javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) guide for writing comments. I'm struggling to find a guide like this for Kotlin or a guide for writing comments in Android Studio. Does anyone know of anything similar to Javadoc that I should follow for creating an app in Kotlin? Or is there a general standard for how comments should be structured in Android Studio?
