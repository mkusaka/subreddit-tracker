I'd like to gain a sense of how strong that disappointment is - paraphrasing an old favorite \"most people say they would vote to send litterbugs to jail, but almost nobody would support a candidate just because they want to send litterbugs to jail.\"\n\nWe talk about ABI a lot, but not all ABI breaks are the same. Some ABI breaks are in the library alone, while others are in the compiler as well. The ABI also has a complex relationship with the standard:\n\n * the ABI is not part of the standard\n * the standard can mandate that some or all implementations change their ABI (e.g. the elimination of COW std::string) \n * some ABI breaks require standard standard support first - either new language features or better library interfaces\n * but some ABI breaks can be taken on by library owners alone \n\nToday, the committee is effectively unwilling to make any changes to the language that would require any implementation to break ABI. And, std:: maintainers are generally unwilling to break the ABI of their implementation.\n\nOne of the things that's a bit silly here is that a new std:: implementation based on one of the existing std:: implementations could break ABI and thereby be faster (and more conformant!) than the std:: implementation it was based on. Of course, this has happened before - this was part of the impetus for creating libc++ instead of continuing to use stdlibc++. I'd like to make such a new implementation, but with ABI incompatibility across major versions as a expectation from day0.\n\nThe core question I'd like to ask is: would you use such an implementation?\n\nThe compiler comes in because we'd like to mangle the names differently, to make incompatibilities occur at link time rather than runtime. \n\nSo, whats the big picture here, and how does it relate to the standard?\n\nThe simple fact is, a metric ton of applications could accept an ABI break no problem. If such applications had an option of voluntarily accepting an ABI break to gain perf, some would. Once 2-5% of applications have voluntarily chosen an ABI break to gain perf, the notion that the committee needs to maintain ABI begins to stand on a much weaker foundation.\n\nSo, would this work? Would you use such an implementation? Would your employer? For those with an understanding of the std::, how much perf do today's std:: implementations leave on the table compared to the total set of available perf from ABI breaks? Who would need to own / ship / use such an implementation in order for it to be viable?\n\nFor reference, I'm a senior engineer at huge tech company that uses C++ heavily, and my software expertise is in C++. I wouldn't consider myself a C++ expert (and sometimes I wonder if anybody truly is a C++ expert), but I know enough to know what I don't know and I know enough to write safe / efficient / secure std:: code.\n\nI'd want to fork a popular std:: implementation on Linux that has an appropriate license. Of those, I'd like to choose the implementation that probably has more users willing to accept an ABI break. Frankly, that's probably libc++.\n\nVery curious on thoughts here.\n\n\\* I'm aware that this isn't want the committee said, but it's the effective result of their decision on Linux, as other std maintainers have posted elsewhere.", "author_fullname": "t2_3rwh2u7f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Would you use my ABI-breaking port of an existing std:: and/or compiler?

And, std:: maintainers are generally unwilling to break the ABI of their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the things that&amp;#39;s a bit silly here is that a new std:: implementation based on one of the existing std:: implementations could break ABI and thereby be faster (and more conformant!) than the std:: implementation it was based on. Of course, this has happened before - this was part of the impetus for creating libc++ instead of continuing to use stdlibc++. I&amp;#39;d like to make such a new implementation, but with ABI incompatibility across major versions as a expectation from day0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The core question I&amp;#39;d like to ask is: would you use such an implementation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The compiler comes in because we&amp;#39;d like to mangle the names differently, to make incompatibilities occur at link time rather than runtime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, whats the big picture here, and how does it relate to the standard?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is, a metric ton of applications could accept an ABI break no problem. If such applications had an option of voluntarily accepting an ABI break to gain perf, some would. Once 2-5% of applications have voluntarily chosen an ABI break to gain perf, the notion that the committee needs to maintain ABI begins to stand on a much weaker foundation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, would this work? Would you use such an implementation? Would your employer? For those with an understanding of the std::, how much perf do today&amp;#39;s std:: implementations leave on the table compared to the total set of available perf from ABI breaks? Who would need to own / ship / use such an implementation in order for it to be viable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference, I&amp;#39;m a senior engineer at huge tech company that uses C++ heavily, and my software expertise is in C++. I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider myself a C++ expert (and sometimes I wonder if anybody truly is a C++ expert), but I know enough to know what I don&amp;#39;t know and I know enough to write safe / efficient / secure std:: code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d want to fork a popular std:: implementation on Linux that has an appropriate license. Of those, I&amp;#39;d like to choose the implementation that probably has more users willing to accept an ABI break. Frankly, that&amp;#39;s probably libc++.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very curious on thoughts here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* I&amp;#39;m aware that this isn&amp;#39;t want the committee said, but it&amp;#39;s the effective result of their decision on Linux, as other std maintainers have posted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi27", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "f94zcr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AnxiousBlueberry9", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 82, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/cpp/comments/f94zcr/would_you_use_my_abibreaking_port_of_an_existing/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/f94zcr/would_you_use_my_abibreaking_port_of_an_existing/", "subreddit_subscribers": 123259, "created_utc": 1582606707.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "cpp", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_3aus3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "HPX 1.4.1 Released! -- The STE||AR Group", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cpp", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_f9cnt5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1582676327.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "stellar-group.org", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi27", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "f9cnt5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hkaiser", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/cpp/comments/f9cnt5/hpx_141_released_the_stear_group/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "http://stellar-group.org/2020/02/hpx-1-4-1-released/", "subreddit_subscribers": 123259, "created_utc": 1582647527.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "cpp", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_6gkbb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How I Declare My class And Why \u2013 Howard E.
