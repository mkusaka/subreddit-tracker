## [6][[AskJS] Is this a good explanation of token-based authentication? :-)](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/exm8g0/askjs_is_this_a_good_explanation_of_tokenbased/)

I'm in the process of writing a blog post about JWTs, and I tried writing a fun little story to describe the concept of token-based authentication. I want to know if it even makes sense and if I'm missing something important.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

**Token Teahose**

You are the proud owner of a very popular teahouse, Token Teahouse. It has thousands upon thousands of members and new people join all the time.
A new face appears at the door, her name is Alice, she want to be a part of Token Teahouse.
You welcome her, and ask for a password, so you can verify her membership at a later time if needed.
After writing down the details in a very very long list of members, you fabricate a special piece of paper for her. It states that Alice is a level 1 tea-sipper and has access to two cups of green tea. The paper is signed by you, so you will know it's authentic.

The following day, Alice is at the door again. A thousand people have already visited since she joined, so you don't recognize her.
Alice claims that she is a level 1 tea-sipper and she shows you the paper to prove it. Sure enough, that's your signature, so you let her in. That only took a few seconds. This is the secret to the success of your amazing teahouse.
Not spending too much time verifying you customers membership, is the key to scale any great teahouse.

Another person, vaguely familiar appears at the door. He claims to be Bob, level 7 tea-downer, but he has no paper to prove it.
Unfortunately Bob forgot to take the paper out of his trousers when washing them. Bob looks a bit ashamed, but you cheer him up: "No biggy Bob! This is why I keep a list of all my members. It will take a while, but we will sort it out". Bob gives you his password, and you start going through the members list to verify if this really is Bobs password.

After a few minutes, you find Bob in the list and sure enough, Bob destroyed the paper but he remembered his password.
You fabricate a new piece of paper for Bob, and let him in.

Say I want to make a 3d image of a house, where if you click on the door, the side frame of website would say "Door" and then some details. How could I do this? I want to know how to make 3d models, and how to embed them and interact with them. Links, videos, or ideas are all appreciated.

When  we are picking classes for the semester (college) we need to manually  enter CRN codes (ID codes for the course) to designated text input  boxes. There's a student plan helper app which exports a js code to  quickly enter CRN's to their boxes and the school said "the usage of  that script is illegal and will get you into trouble"

My question is, if I use the code anyways, can they detect that I've run a local js code?

Here's a sample js code for two lectures.

`javascript:var crn=[14305,10984];for(var i=0;i&lt;crn.length;i++){var d=document.getElementById("crn_id"+(i+1));d.value=crn[i];}void(0);`

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a simulated add drop page to test the code.

So I've been working on this new site for a few days, but I have had the idea for months. Essentially, it's aimed at a line-by-line approach to teaching JavaScript targeted to folks who might find things like the MDN docs to be a bit too dense.

The following is a proof-of-concept, I'm not necessarily looking for criticism about the current content, but rather the usefulness of the idea as a whole. Thank you in advance!

**Edit:** So I'm already sensing I need to be clearer in the app itself that the app provides *examples* and, at the end of a section, it can provide a link to MDN or something similar to give more details. I'm definitely going to at least add an "introduction" to each page to set up the example and clarify that it's not an "exhaustive" use of the specified method.
