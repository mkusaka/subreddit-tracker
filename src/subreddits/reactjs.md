In what part of the code are we setting that the newly added todos(through addTodo func)are being set to isCompleted:false so that they are not crossed out from the beginning(since we are only adding text in addTodo)?

    import React,{useState,useEffect} from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    
    const LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY='todo_app.todos'
    
    function Todo({todo,index,completeTodo,removeTodo}){
    return (
    
    &lt;div className='todo'&gt;
    &lt;div style={{textDecoration:todo.isCompleted? 'line-through':null}}&gt; 
      {todo.text}
    
    &lt;button onClick={()=&gt;completeTodo(index)}&gt;Complete&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={()=&gt;removeTodo(index)}&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    )
    
    }
    
    function TodoForm({addTodo}){
    const[value,setValue]=useState('')
     
    function submitHandler(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    if(!value){
      return
    }
    addTodo(value)
    setValue('')
    } 
    
    return(
      &lt;form onSubmit={submitHandler}&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" value={value} onChange={e=&gt;setValue(e.target.value)}/&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    )
     
    
    
     
      
    }
    
    function App(){
    const[todos,setTodos]=useState([
      {text:'Go out with a girl',
    isCompleted:false
    },
    {text:'Learn React',
    isCompleted:false
    },
    {text:'Read a book',
    isCompleted:false
    },
    ])
    useEffect(()=&gt;{
    const storedTodos=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY))
    if (storedTodos){
    setTodos(storedTodos)
    }
    },[])
    useEffect(()=&gt;{
      localStorage.setItem(LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY,JSON.stringify(todos))
    },[todos])
    function addTodo(text){
     const newTodos=[...todos,{text}]
     setTodos(newTodos)
    }
    function completeTodo(index){
    const newTodos=[...todos]
    newTodos[index].isCompleted=true
    setTodos(newTodos)
    
    }
    function removeTodo(index){
    const newTodos=[...todos]
    newTodos.splice(index,1)
    setTodos(newTodos)
    
    }
    return(
    &lt;div className="app"&gt;
     &lt;div className="todo-list"&gt;
      {todos.map((todo,index)=&gt;(
        &lt;Todo todo={todo} index={index} key={index} completeTodo={completeTodo} removeTodo={removeTodo}/&gt;
      ))}
      &lt;TodoForm addTodo={addTodo}/&gt;

I made this site for my tai chi students near the beginning of covid, [https://breathetaichi.com](https://breathetaichi.com/)  
It  was my first project, and I'd like to go back to it and make it  portfolio worthy.  My only other piece I really like to show is [https://protopla.net](https://protopla.net/)

I'd  love to hear any critiques of either site, but the my main question  would be is there a standard way to display as much info as I have on my  tai chi site?  It feels kinda messy, and I'm too close to it  to be able to see what it should be. 

Thanks!

Hey guys, I made a chatbot with reactjs and ran npm run build.

Now I wat to use the built code inside other websites. So my chatbot will popup on other websites.

How can I implement it to other codebases?

 I created a function to check if in my database a user exists according to the `sub` parameter.

**Front-end**

    async function exist (sub)¬† {  
    const response¬†=¬†await InfoDataService.get(sub);   
    console.log(response); ¬†¬†¬†¬†  
    }¬†¬†  

**InfoDataService**

    import http from "../http-common.js";   
    const get¬†=¬†sub =&gt;¬†{  
    return http.get(`/users/${sub}`);   
    };   
    export default¬†{ get, };  

**Controller**

    //¬†Find¬†a¬†single¬†User¬†with¬†sub  
    exports.findOne¬†=¬†(req,¬†res)¬†=&gt;¬†{   
    const sub¬†=¬†req.params.sub;  
    User.findOne({sub}) ¬†¬†  
    .then(data =&gt;¬†{ res.send(data); ¬†¬†  
    }) ¬†¬†  
    .catch(err =&gt;¬†{   
    res.status(500).send({ message: "Error¬†retrieving¬†User¬†with¬†sub=" + sub});  });  
     };  

**Route**

    module.exports¬†=¬†app =&gt;¬†{  
    const users¬†=¬†require("../controllers/user.controller.js");  
    const router¬†=¬†require("express").Router();   
    
    //¬†Retrieve¬†a¬†single¬†Tutorial¬†with¬†sub   
    router.get("/:sub",¬†users.findOne);  
     
    app.use('/api/users',¬†router);  
    };  

The path for post is `api/users`, while for get it is `api/users/:sub`. Checking the network I found that the asynchronous function makes the request to `api/users/undefined`. Where would the error be?

The problem is in the asynchronous function. Create, update, getAll etc ... also work well in this API. I also have an API for published posts, structured the same way and it works. I don't understand why only the asynchronous function follows a different and wrong path.

In a custom dropdown, There is an input type text and a different container floating below the input which contains the list of options. How do I select the options in the container floating below using the arrow keys when I focus on the input? (I've attached a screen-capture below)

Here's a link to the trimmed down version of my project if anyone wants to see the actual code:

The project is created with next.js and typescript.

Hi!  


I have a feeling this is a simple issue, but I can't seem to figure it out. I've built a simple website with React and Next.JS. On mobile, I have a navigation bar that opens from the side and has position: absolute. When the sidebar is opened, I do not want users to be able to scroll the page. However, since the content on the sidebar is more than the average screen can display, I do want users to scroll inside the sidebar. Is there a universal or commonly used way to approach this?  


Thanks in advance,  
Quinten
