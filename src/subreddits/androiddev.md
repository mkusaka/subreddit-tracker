This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hey there üëã!
I've written a much longer post (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jellyfin/comments/jll3jm/android_update_blocked_by_google/) about this at r/jellyfin) but I'll provide a summary here.

We have an app that we've submitted with Android Auto for the first time. We got rejected for not providing login info. I filled in the Policy - App Content section about it and resubmitted. It's still getting rejected. Any ideas?
## [7][Is it easy to port a SDL2 app to android?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlvxya/is_it_easy_to_port_a_sdl2_app_to_android/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlvxya/is_it_easy_to_port_a_sdl2_app_to_android/

I'm planning to write an app using SDL2. I haven't decided if I want to use zig or C++ but both can be compiled with LLVM. If my app is only using SDL2 could someone simply just compile it for android or is there more to it? I don't make android apps but when I tried compiling an SDL2 app for android I couldn't get anything working and literally gave up due to compile errors and no solutions online (maybe theyre common ones that everyone knows except for a non android developer like me)

If it's as easy as a recompile I'll develop the app with android in mind but will it be a simple recompile?

My focus in this small project was to get MVVM right and separate the logic between the fragment and the ViewModel properly. In the past, I've been writing a lot of logic in my fragments and I'm trying to learn how to do that better.

I use Channels converted to Flow to emit events from my ViewModels for my fragments to listen to.

Can someone take a look at this project and give some feedback? Any big mistakes?

## [9][They mystery of background activity &amp; background data.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlw59z/they_mystery_of_background_activity_background/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlw59z/they_mystery_of_background_activity_background/
---
I've scorched all over the internet and I can't seem to find any factually accurate information about of these topics. All I see are opinions and guesses, this leading me to make this post.


In settings of apps there are two types of usage, battery usage and data usage.

In battery usage there's foreground activity and background activity.

Foreground activity is "on" by default on every app but background activity is "off".

Question - what is foreground activity? How does it effect the battery performance when switched on or off?

Then there's data usage, in which there's only background data option which is "on" by default on every app.

Now, that's confusing.

If the background activity is "off" then why is the background data "on"?  shouldn't it be "off" too?

Why does the app need any background data if the app is not doing any activity in the background?

Question- what's the difference between background activity and background data?

What are the effects of background activity on battery performance when switched on or off?

What are the effects of background data on battery performance when switched on or off?
 
Some say background activity/data should be turned off to save battery while some it should be turned on to save battery as the app will keep asking permission to get on, or will keep getting on and off wasting battery. What's the truth?

And let me say this again, I'm looking for facts, not guesses or opinions.

Thanks!
## [10][Apps close as soon as screen off.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlu3zw/apps_close_as_soon_as_screen_off/)

My phone is Samsung galaxy A20. As soon as the screen off the app which i was using closes and returns to the homepage, its not killed though. If i manually lock the screen and unlock it, the app is still there , it only happens when the screen auto off's  after timeout.
I made sure that developer options was off,  battery optimization was off , and putting unused apps to sleep was also off. But nothing works.

Edit- i just found out that it happens when i double tap the screen to wake and does not happen when i press the power button or use the finger print sensor. But still why does it happen?
## [11][Best approach to generate Order ID for payment transactions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlm7vl/best_approach_to_generate_order_id_for_payment/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jlm7vl/best_approach_to_generate_order_id_for_payment/
---
Currently, I am using simple linear addition for generating new order IDs like 110000, 110001, 110002... But in this approach anyone can calculate number of orders placing on my app. So I want to add a new approach in which order ID is Readable but not Understandable by the user. I want to use this in my android app. So what can I do to achieve this using some logic or 3rd party libraries?
