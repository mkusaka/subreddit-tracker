**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Hi,

I Just started learning C++ for UE 4 game development, still learning basic syntax, I'm just curious, why everyone says C++ is difficult comparing to other languages.

I'm still a beginner and I didn't start learning deep concepts

thanks.
## [4][What is the best way to embed python on a Qt/C++ applicattion [closed]](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlabb3/what_is_the_best_way_to_embed_python_on_a_qtc/)

So, I do not know if this is the right place for me to ask that kind of question. Sorry if it is not.

I am working on a Qt project using C++ and I am needing to embed a python script.

Researching, I have seen that there are several ways of doing this -- using one of those tools [PythonQt](https://mevislab.github.io/pythonqt/index.html), [Boost Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html), [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and [Python/C API](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html).

On my application, it will be necessary for the C++ code part to  execute functions -- with arguments -- on a python module and get the  output of it. However, the opposite will not be necessary (The Python  part will not need to know the "existence" of the C++ part). That way,  it will not be necessary to do something like extending and embedding at  the same time, just the embedding part.

In my application, the response time of the tasks and code  readability are extremely important, I want this process to be as  optimized as possible and I want that any code partner could understand  and maintain the code -- and maybe replicate something similar in the  future -- without too many obstacles.

What is the best way to perform such an operation? Would it be using one of the those options: [PythonQt](https://mevislab.github.io/pythonqt/index.html), [Boost Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html), [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) or [Python/C API](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html)? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these options?

This is not compatible with STL smart pointers. Perhaps once I will investigate the possibility to create smart pointers with limited functionality to use with the Fibonacci memory manager.

This is a container representing a data structure to cache and query multi-dimensional Pareto fronts and archives with its most expensive operations in O(n log n) time. Pareto fronts can be used to cache objects in any situation where there is a trade-off between the quality of multiple objectives. Whenever the front pushes an element better than the other in all dimensions, the dominated points are automatically removed from the set. In a Pareto archive, whenever the front pushes an element better than the other in all dimensions, the dominated points are moved to higher fronts in the archive.

Hi Guys, 

  I'm searching for GitHub open source projects with good code coverage (at least &gt; 50%). Preferably coverage measured using gcov. Kindly point out to good blog comparing projects or links to project.

Backwards compatibility is great because it helps ease the adoption of technology be it hardware or software, but it can potentially leads to solutions with degraded efficiency, unnecessary complexity, poorer security implications and much more. As a example, read Intel's x64 design docs which had to use rather complex components merely because of providing backwards compatibility.

C++ had to be backwards compatible with C in order to ease adoption (among other possible reasons), but many realized that changes had to be made such as introducing smart pointers, abandoning C-style arrays, and going functional with ranges, just to name a few. Change is good, in-fact it's great! The problem however is that unless you're up-to-date with the latest best-practice guidelines usually given out by the other more-experienced community members, it can be significantly easier to shoot yourself in the foot. Even though compilers and a handful of other techniques/tools (such as static analysis, ASAN) do an amazing job at helping you to avoid common pitfalls (e.g detecting possible memory corruptions) and to follow best-practices, yet it's hard to train programmers to always write safe code, and even harder to integrate these into large-scale build pipelines. This is exactly why Rust, which is aimed at being safer (e.g by built-in memory sanitization) and (almost) as fast at C++, was developed. No wonder why Microsoft released a statement saying, "Rust is the Industry's 'Best Chance' at safe systems", and increasingly we see more teams choosing to use Rust for their new projects as opposed to C++.

Now, I've played around with Rust and it seems promising in terms of performance and safety, however (don't take my word for it) it could be missing some cool C++-like features/abstractions e.g static reflection, ranges etc. Additionally, C++ has a huge community which is growing everyday and a lot of people are doing groundbreaking research in order to introduce cool features to the language such as dynamic reflection, executors etc. Of course, these features can be implemented in one form or another in other programmer languages like Rust, but languages can differ 1) in terms of performance for an implementation of the same abstraction (e.g C++ templates with concepts could be faster than Rust generics?) 2) grammar (which can make implementation of some language features easier/harder) 3) syntax (e.g Rust tries too hard not to mimic C-family syntax). Given this and perhaps other reasons, some programmer might still prefer to use C++ for its cool new features which are coming out every 3 years (big thanks to all the researchers and implementers behind it!).

I think some people will agree that C++ code can be just as fast as C and in some even cases even faster, thanks to a great set of low-to-zero cost abstractions and the incredibly-smart compilers (with their RVOs etc) for generating optimized machine code. I feel like there's a need for a C++ compiler made just for (post-)modern C++ without any regard for backwards-compatibility which would strictly implement some of the fundamental best-practices, such as, making all variables `const` unless they don't have to be, forbidding uninitialized variables or even forcing you to abandon raw pointers, while offering built-in memory sanitization at compile times among other things. This is just an initial suggestion for desired features, but if we explore, I'm sure there are other undesirable, unsafe things that language permits yet we would not like to see them in our codes anymore. I think that a modern C++ compiler which would outright reject *horrible, unsafe C++98 code* (which is what most recent college graduates write because their professors taught them C++98) seems invaluable, and, maybe a step in the right direction towards building safer and faster systems!

P.S This is just a thought, so I would love to hear what people here think!

**Edit: FAQs**

Q: What about the safety vs speed trade-off?  
A: Lightweight abstractions like `std::unique_pointer` are still as fast albeit with greater safety in the general case. As someone pointed out in comments, a great swath of UB can be avoided transparently. UB for something trivial like integers addition doesn't need to exist today! Ask any scalable systems programmer, and they will want more "defined behavior" from their programming language than "undefined behavior".

Q: I know when to delete my pointers or how to tackle UB, why should I care?  
A: Well, you know better (good for you!), but not an average-joe-programmer who's starting to learn C++. Kids spend dozens of hours dealing with "seg faults" because they accessed a pointer that had already been freed. To make lifetime analysis easier for compilers, you need clear well-defined ownerships rules which is what smart pointers (minus std::weak\_ptr) give you. Permit weakly-typed pointers (like pointer to void types) and suddenly there's too much complexity to deal with.

Q: What about the backwards compatibility? What's the migration strategy?  
A: You can have the choice to use either (post-)modern C++ or not in existing compilers (using \[\[safe/unsafe\]\] attributes as people suggested) but if that leads to unnecessary complexity, I'd rather start with a fresh compiler built-only for modern/post-modern C++ which would only accepts a *safe subset of the language*.

Q: What's included in safe C++?  
A: People have pointed out really amazing things in comments below. There's a great deal of literature out there. For example, I read a book on C++17 and realized I'd rather only use `std::variant` than unsafe-type `union`s. I don't any reason why we, as a community, cannot agree on what safe C++ is.

Q: If you want safe C++, there's Rust, Swift etc?  
A: I love C++ too much to abandon it, and I want more people to program in it while making the core language easier for beginners. Don't you?

Strf is a formatting library that provides a convenient way for converting one character encoding to another.

It allows you to choose whether the presence of nonconformant surrogate codepoints is allowed ( sometimes we want to allow them ).

The documentation is not complete — particularly on how to extend the library, which I may change — but I think there is enough material for one to have a pretty good idea:

* [Overview](https://robhz786.github.io/strf/v0.12.0/introduction.html)
* [Charset transcoding](https://robhz786.github.io/strf/v0.11.1/quick_reference.html#character_encoding)
* [Repository](https://github.com/robhz786/strf)

Maybe someone can spot any design flaw or suggest any worthy breaking change before I release version 1.0. 

Best Regards
