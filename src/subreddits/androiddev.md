I got a pretty nice idea for a survey app and I realy want to make it happen. I was always very interested in programming but with school and other things I never had enough time. Can you tell me what do I need to make this survey app?  Thanks :)

I'm working on videoview where you can pinch to zoom.
I achieved this by ,
Doing 
Float factor = scaleGestureDetector.getScaleFactor();
But the problem is it only zooms into center no matter where i pinch . How to zoom into the center of pinch rather than center of screen

When I visit sites like Dribbble, I see a lot of beautiful layouts and animations. But when I actually use the apps, I rarely see any animations/transitions. Are there any apps that made you go wow recently?

I really feel like there has been no innovation in terms of design quality in apps. I rarely/almost never see complex transitions being implemented in apps. I'd really like to see some apps which are really well made in design.

Hi! I'm currently developing an application. I have a tabbed activity, divided in 3 fragments. In one of them I have to access another activity ( think of WhatsApp and how you access a conversation) but I can't manage to link the activity to the fragment. If it helps, The object that links those 2 is a button.

Hello Android Dev's!

I am hoping to develop a wireless wifi transfer application. What I'm hoping to do is use an approach somewhat similar to SHAREit. I want to make the application compatible with very old android versions and Windows (hopefully adding Linux and MacOS support eventually).

Older Windows PC's are incompatible with android's file transferring system due to lack of system drivers and the removal of making Android appear as a USB drive didn't help either. I also noticed that applications also dropped support for Windows XP and Vista as their EOL came along. So, I am dreaming of making a wireless transfer application that can work with Windows 95 PC's and later. It frustrates me to see a Windows XP PC cannot directly transfer from a phone and is required to use an indirect method.

If anyone here has experience with writing programs on older Windows and Android systems, please let me know! I'm currently a student in C++ and only know very basics so far.

Since a security patch last year (May, I think), Android turns off ADB after rebooting. Is there any way to change this (with our without root)? If not, does anyone know where the AOSP commit that did it is?
