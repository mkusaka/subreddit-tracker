This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I have a final stage Android interview coming up. One of the rounds will be a "bug squash" session where you're given an existing repo, and are supposed to resolve some bugs. If anyone has experience with these kinds of interviews, I'd appreciate some tips or best practices for approaching it. My strategy going in was just to rely on logcat and profiler to detect memory leaks or blocked ui thread/other issues.

More than 90% of apps have recycler views in it and 100% of them have listeners attached to it. If you don't follow the technique, you will go insane debugging your recycler views

Check out my first tech article, feedbacks &amp; suggestions are always welcome :)

So I started using Android Studio on my Linux PC (8GB ram, i5). When I run the app the default emulator, it shows the google icon after 2-3 minutes, freezes itself and every other app. Laptop is not functional anymore. I have to hold the power button down.

So I wanted to try Genymotion as many people said it was fast. But I couldn't find any Genymotion plugin in the marketplace. What is the solution? Or is there some other method. Can I run that app in genymotion from outside android studio (I think you can)? 

I want to get done with this as soon as possible as its for a project. I don't even like doing this.

Thanks in advance!!

 `Intent deleteIntent=new Intent(getApplicationContext(),intentService.class);`

  
`// deleteIntent.putExtra(newPath,Intent.EXTRA_TEXT);`

  
 `PendingIntent` 

`pendingIntent=PendingIntent.getService(getApplicationContext(),1002,deleteIntent,PendingIntent.FLAG_ONE_SHOT);`

  
 `AlarmManager alarmManager=(AlarmManager)getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);`

  
 `alarmManager.set(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP, 1000*6, pendingIntent);`

as you can see this is a simple alarm manager with a pending intent but instead of launching after 1 minute of time it gets launched as the program runs without waiting for the time passed
## [10][I think Google should give Google Play Billing api the similar treatment they gave to Camera 2 with CameraX](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jh934k/i_think_google_should_give_google_play_billing/)

I don't know about you, but looking at Billing library, it is a whole lot of too many stages, too many setups, too many listeners just to process a freaking transaction. I wish they simplify it further to cover 90% of uses cases, just like they did away with CameraX.

Hello,

I have been working as a android developer for last 4 years and worked on many projects. But still i find myself lost when i try to go in depth of any complex issue. I was a lazy developer and didnt give much time for learning new things and go in depth.  I didnt use any design pattern in my projects. And when i give  any interview i cant show confidence. This is making me frustrated. 

so i want to relearn everything and go in depth of everything. I wanna know everything about android development and architecture. 

Now i need your suggestion. Please suggest me which things i should learn to be a good android developer and save me from my frustration? Please guide me. 

Thank you.
