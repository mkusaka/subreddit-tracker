Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

I can't produce a link off the top of my head, but I remember Bjarne Stroustrup saying (on a few occasions, in a talk or a panel) that "non-type template parameters were introduced in C++ over the dead bodies of some type theorists" (quote from memory). This surprises me since types depending on values is a fundamental concept in Martin-Löf type theory which is older than C++. Does anyone have any knowledge on what feedback Bjarne Stroustrup received from type theorists?

Hi r/cpp,

As many of you recently saw, there were several highly controversial threads over the past few days. The active mod team (myself, u/cleroth, and u/blelbach) were simply unprepared for this, and we've been working on addressing the issues with the subreddit that have been brought up. Most recently, an inactive senior mod returned and disrupted our work by de-modding and banning u/cleroth, removing most mod powers from u/blelbach, and attempting to make rule changes. (If you're unfamiliar with reddit's mod seniority system, it allows senior mods to remove junior mods at any time - so I was unable to stop this.)

We're glad to report that order has been restored, thanks to the top-ranked mod who graciously responded to our request for help. The disruptive mod has been removed, and the changes have been reverted. u/cleroth and u/blelbach's mod powers have been restored.

It has been a very long week. While we've returned to the state the subreddit was initially in, the mod team still needs to address the underlying problems. Here's a quick summary of our plans:

* We're going to write more detailed rules and guidance.
* We're going to improve moderation to enforce those rules, almost certainly recruiting more mods. If you'd like to apply, send us a modmail, although it may take us some time to reply.
* We'll decide whether u/blelbach will retain his mod powers. He has repeatedly apologized for his actions.
* We've set up a moderator Discord so we can communicate more rapidly when important issues arise (previously, we acted near-independently). To be clear, this isn't a secret society where we're brewing nefarious plans. (We *already* had the ability to communicate privately via modmail.) As we make decisions, informed by user feedback, we'll communicate them here.
* We're going to continue to collect feedback to make improvements; please send us your thoughts via modmail. (We've upgraded the modmail system to more easily read and respond.)

We'll make another announcement when we have progress to report.

For the time being, this thread will remain open for comments, if users wish to discuss things beyond sending modmails. I ask of you, for the love of cats, please behave well. We reserve the right to remove egregious comments and lock the thread if it becomes necessary. Please do not create other posts to discuss this - they will be removed.

It's been years since I had a C++ job. I got back into it recently and finally hit a wall on debugging a problem. What are your techniques on debugging C++ problems?

Hi, the author of [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox) again. I'm now working on a more comprehensive [library](https://github.com/jk-jeon/fp) with features related to conversions between strings and floating-point numbers. It's in an early stage and is not really usable right now AFAICT, but I want to gather some opinions from you guys. Please take a look at the [repo](https://github.com/jk-jeon/fp) if you are interested. Any idea/feedback is very welcome, and contribution is even more welcome.

As stated in the README, the goal of the library is to provide conversion algorithms between decimal and binary floating-point  numbers rather than string parsing/formatting. String parsing/formatting routines provided in the library should be considered as proof-of-concepts, although I'll continue to work on improving them as well. Therefore, I put much effort on cleanly separate decimal/binary conversion routines from string parsing/formatting as much as possible.

Currently, the library has the following features (with rudimentary/subject-to-change API's):

1. **Dragonbox**: shortest-roundtrip binary-to-decimal conversion algorithm for formatting. The version in this library is not really different from the original implementation, except that it uses a larger table (in order to share it with the parsing algorithm).
2. **Ryu-printf**: fixed-precision binary-to-decimal conversion algorithm for formatting. This is nothing more than just an implementation of the algorithm as written in the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3360595) with a few modifications, but somewhat mysteriously it uses way fewer amount of static data compared to the original implementation by Ulf Adams. (I honestly have no idea why this happened.) But the size of static data is still huge; it's about 40KB.
3. **Dooly**: limited-precision (9 for `float`'s, 17 for `double`'s) decimal-to-binary conversion algorithm for parsing. This is the one that I mentioned in the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ishdj9/updates_in_dragonbox/) about Dragonbox. Ryu library also provides a similar algorithm, and it seems that the performances of these algorithms are similar.
4. Combining Dooly and (a slight extension of) Ryu-printf, string-to-float parsing for arbitrary length input is also possible. A gist of the idea is explained in the comment of /u/STL in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iqlnt4/parsing_floats_in_c_benchmarking_strtod_vs_from/). (I originally got the idea from discussions with fast\_io's author, though.) /u/STL said that it might be agonizingly slow, but it turned out to be a lot faster than the current implementation of MS STL's  `std::from_chars`. (To be fair, my implementation does way fewer error handlings so the actual performance gap should be somewhat smaller.)
