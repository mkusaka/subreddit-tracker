Hello React devs!

At [https://mutualaid.world](https://mutualaid.world/volunteer) we are building a 100% open source app to make volunteers‚Äô and community organisers‚Äô lives easier and **empower communities to help themselves.**

We‚Äôve been working on resilience apps [since Hurricane Sandy.](https://mutualaid.world/heres-what-were-building/) We focused on post-disaster resilience in communities - how well a community can recover after a catastrophe. A hurricane is different from a pandemic, so we‚Äôve been working hard with our new volunteers (over 150 active people[ on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/coronadonor/shared_invite/zt-cwm4b79c-12NHPqGWbzZ1aR5geyME1g)) to change our code to focus on where the need is greatest. We‚Äôve also been organising ourselves and our many volunteers.

After talking to a number of volunteer groups, we heard that the greatest need now is food ‚Äì so that‚Äôs where we are focused. Delivering food and pharmacy needs is crucial because [normal delivery systems are not keeping up](https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/online-grocery-orders-have-delivery-pickup-services-on-overload-during-coronavirus-crisis/article_edbf1c06-6921-11ea-ab93-839914b63a19.html), and vulnerable people can‚Äôt access what they need. At the same time, farmers‚Äô markets have too much food and no way to distribute it ‚Äì so there‚Äôs an obvious need for systems that can solve this problem. We are [already delivering food in LA](http://mutualaid.world/volunteer) as we test out our tool, but we hope to expand into more areas soon. A number of volunteer organizations already exist, using ‚Äòad hoc‚Äô systems, but they need decent tools to organize themselves. We already have a big queue of people wanting to use our system. Come help us build it!

We‚Äôre ready to get more people on board to help us cover more than just food delivery. **Donor sponsoring of food and resources for families in need** is high on our list. **We need your skills to make this happen!**.

**Come** [**join us**](https://mutualaid.world/volunteer/) **!**

*If you happen to be reading this and aren‚Äôt a React dev, join anyway! We need Rails/Node/Python/Firebase devs, technical writers, designers, community organizers, volunteers, translators, communicators and marketers, data scientists, and testers.*

Hello everyone,

I've created a website using Create-React-App and I'm wondering if it's possible to transition the app into using CMS solution in case this person wants to change text in different places.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any experience with this. Would it make sense to change to Gatsby, try to copy paste everything over? What do I do exactly?

&amp;#x200B;

The app is quite simple, it's not grabbing data from any external apis and needs to be setup in a trigger a e-mail.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope some people with expertise in this field can give a few pointers!
## [7][Looking for a function to create a new setState for a part of the state](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fwk2ok/looking_for_a_function_to_create_a_new_setstate/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fwk2ok/looking_for_a_function_to_create_a_new_setstate/
---
Hey, does anybody know if there exists a function where I could do this:

    const [state, setState] = React.useState({a: 0, b: 'hello'})
    const setB = createSetSubState(setState, 'b')
     .... 
    setB(oldB =&gt; oldB + ' world')

and also

```
const [state, setState] = React.useState([0,1,2]) 
const setElem2 = createSetSubState(setState, 2) 
....
 setB(oldElem2 =&gt; oldElem2 + 1)
```

Preferably with typescript types, but a JS implementation would be great.

It's useful for many things, not limited to just doing form inputs using setState.

Thanks!

Making a test using Jest to check the attributes of color and height. I am new to the react world and was wondering the best way to do this.

I wanted to use the setProps and toHaveStyleRule components be used and pass in an attribute of "foo", since right now we are only checking hard coded values. Anyone have good tutorials or documentation for me to look at?

I know, classes are out of trend, but i am bound to them for now.

I got this textarea class, and i call it like so:

                &lt;Textarea
                    placeholder={'twestest'}
                    onSubmit={v =&gt; console.log(v)}
                /&gt;

and the class looks like this:

    
    class Textarea extends Component {
        state = {
            value: null,
        }
    
        setValue = value =&gt; this.setState({ value })
        render() {
            const { placeholder, onSubmit } = this.props
            return (
                &lt;div className="field"&gt;
                    &lt;div className="control"&gt;
                        &lt;textarea
                            className="textarea"
                            value={this.state.value || placeholder}
                            onChange={e =&gt; this.setValue(e.currentTarget.value)}
                        /&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;button
                        className="button is-success"
                        disabled={this.state.value === null}
                        onClick={e =&gt; onSubmit(this.state.value)}
                    &gt;
                        &lt;FormattedMessage id="SubmitButton_button"&gt;&lt;/FormattedMessage&gt;
                    &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            )
        }
    }

Is this the right way to handle a placeholder prob?

&amp;nbsp;

As a coding excesise to help learn React some more, I made a small single view app that lets you upload an image and turn it majority black, for use on OLED screens.   All the image manipulation takes place in the client, so nothing gets uploaded to a server.  

&amp;nbsp;

Technologies used:

- React
- Material-UI (framework)
- Jimp (image manipulation)
- react-toast-notifications (user feedback)

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I still have a lot to learn, but this taught me a lot.  My biggest how-do-I-do-it right now is how to deal with layout out a page without having hundreds of lines of formatting.

My next step is to convert it to typescript, 1 component at a time, to learn how to use Typescript, as I feel that would make anything I work on more organized once I get used to the extra boilerplate required.
