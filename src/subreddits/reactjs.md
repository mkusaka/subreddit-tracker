## [3][Testing Redux: to Mock store or not?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jdzh7c/testing_redux_to_mock_store_or_not/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jdzh7c/testing_redux_to_mock_store_or_not/
---
A lot of times our React components will either render something or not, based on the Redux state.

In testing I've found two approaches to this:

1. mock the store (and pass it some default values)
2. Use the 'real' store (and then changing the state by dispatching actions trough *store.dispatch(action(payload))* )

Approach 1 seems to be more of a unit test whereas 2 could be considered more of an integration test.

However, the lines between unit and integration tests are sometimes somewhat blurry. Regardless the type of the test: I just want to check whether the right thing(s) render or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering what the best approach would be here with respect to good testing practices.

I am currently studying Docker and applying it to a simple React.js app. I see how dockerizing my app makes it easier to deploy on Docker but I still fail to grasp what do I do when I want to deploy the app on a server so it is actually available publicly.   
How does docker help me with this?  Also, currently, to my understanding when I build a docker image and them somebody else runs this image, they see my app running but they don't see my code actually ( at least I am not aware of how that might work). So I would like to see if somebody can clarify this to me?   


Thanks in advance. I am sorry if this is really a stupid question, I just fail to grasp the whole concept.

I am starting with React but as I progressed I got to know that the styling part is quite confusing. I was wondering if some React pros can provide me with some tips on what should I do. Like when should I use styled components, CSS Modules, and I love using SCSS and creating everything using that!

React newbie here is asking for some help. Here is the deal: I have an array of 4 objects (in my Data.js  
  file) and, after clicking on a button, I want to display only the items  belonging to "category A" in my example below. I'm a bit confused with  the use of setState (which I assume I would need since my button will  "update" the initial state to only reflect the data I want to display  (hence item 1 and 4). Any ideas how it can be done? Cheers!

**index.js**

    import React, {Component} from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import Data from "./Data.js";
    
    
    
    class Root extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                items: Data,
            }
        }
    
    myFunctionA = () =&gt; {
        //
    }
        
    render() {
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={this.myFunctionA}&gt;Click me to display item 1 &amp; 4&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                
            )
        }
    }
    
    ReactDOM.render(&lt;Root /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"))

 **Data.js** 

 

    const Data = [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "First item",
        "category": "A"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Second item",
        "category": "B"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Third item",
        "category": "C"
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Fourth item",
        "category": "A"
      },
    ]
    
    export default Data

For example, I want to show fallback while my data is fetching. However, when my data finishes fetching, I want fallback to be visible for a couple of seconds more.

How do I do it?

This is a library for writing React applications using reactivity system which brings clear and concise way of data manipulation and out of the box optimized components for high performance. It also introduces a new way of creating functional component (inspired by Vue composition api), and a flux-like store.
