We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I've been on the hook train since it went into production last year. But for the life of me I don't ever think of using useReducer/useCallback/useMemo over the core 3. I feel like I understand what they are used for, but Id on't know when to actually apply them. I've read articles on it and I still don't get it. So I'm hoping I can find someone here that can finally tick that switch for me.
## [4][The state of Suspense for data loading.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fonqdt/the_state_of_suspense_for_data_loading/)

Can anyone clarify on the current state of the Suspense component in React?

The current react documentation is kind of obscure on this subject and the only things that I can so far figure out are the following:

\-Suspense is stable and can be used for code splitting.

\-Suspense is not stable in concurrent mode is still experimental and should not be used.

This is clear to me, however there are things that get me really confused. According to the React team, you should not yet use Suspense for data fetching, while at the same time I see alot of blogs describing how to use Suspense for data fetching (eg. [https://blog.logrocket.com/using-suspense-with-react-query/](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-suspense-with-react-query/)) and libraries supporting this at the moment (React Query,  SWR, ...).

So I am confused about whether to use this feature already or not? The main reason that I want to switch to this new way of fetching is because it produces much cleaner code (using suspense and errorboundary) than what the normal lifecycle methods currently offer.

Also a target date for the final release of the concurrent mode would be highly appreciated.

Hey y'all, link to the site is [covid415.herokuapp.com](https://covid415.herokuapp.com)   


We used the MERN stack, and what was cool about this project is we all have never used Express.js before so we used that for our backend, as well as MongoDB for our database. We all are pretty comfortable with React, and found it a lot of fun to collaborate on. We only had 5 days to build this as a team and all learned so much about planning, organizing, git workflow, and communication.

  
We are all currently about to enter the Job Market, and all criticism and advice is welcome, as we're trying to improve as much as we can.  
Here's a link to the GitHub: [https://github.com/emostov/covid415](https://github.com/emostov/covid415)  


Thanks again so much! Been following this subreddit for a long time now, and it feels so good to finally say i can be active and apart of the community. 

Also the app itself is specific to San Francisco.

I am super excited to share my first major open source project called Appwrite and I would really appreciate your feedbacks. üôè

Appwrite is an open-source platform for developers that abstracts and simplifies common and repeating development tasks behind REST APIs, in order to help developers build apps way faster.

Appwrite has many cool services like a DB which integrate directly into clients, file upload and file cropping management, user authentication (OAuth support, password recovery and more) and many more cool services that all try to make developers life a lot more easy and less frustrating.

The best way to learn more is to visit the project website and docs (https://appwrite.io/docs) or to check out the GitHub repository (https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite).

The project is just at the start of its way, any feedback will be very much appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I feel like it‚Äôs a common issue I run into where a bunch of pages in my app have a ‚Äúloading/success/fail‚Äù state where I want to show different views on the page depending on the state. I typically just drop a renderWhatever() function inside my render function that contains a switch statement for the loading/success/fail states and returns the relevant elements on the page. However I feel like it‚Äôs really repetitive and messy.

Is there a standard HOC or hook of some sort to handle this?
