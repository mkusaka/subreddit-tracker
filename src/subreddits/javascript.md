Hi there,

I'm trying to create something of a name generator/randomizer for my website.

You know, push a button and ideas appears. Something like the following: https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/bird-names.php

Is it possible to create something like this using HTML or Javascript?

On my server I can detect queries, /?name=value. I know I can pass these to the server from a served HTML page from a form, say. But I’d really like to have a button that just sends a given string directly, without a form. (I have a keypad, and pushing the keys stores the results in a string using JS. So no form. I’d like to send that string once the user presses “Enter”.) I just don’t know the best mechanism for this. AJAX?
