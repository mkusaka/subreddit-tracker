I have installed Ruby 2.7.0 from snap, when I try to `gem install pg`, gem gives me this:
```
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (ArgumentError)
    "@\x01\x00\x00@\x01" is not an octal string
```

What cloud it be?

I dont even know the existence of ArgumentError until now


Edit:
Added `gem "pg"` to a gem file, even thought that didn't installed the bind, the command that bundler give me (`gem install pg -v '1.2.2' --source 'https://rubygems.org/`) didn't raised that exception anymore but still it cant build native extensions

It is difficult for me to get understandings of OOP, as it could give big opportunities in learning programming language especially java/C#. I sought many books and courses and unfortunately failed in it, I know java's basic syntax. Yesterday I found book on amazon "Practical Object Oriented Programming on Ruby" it has many good recommendations, especially about explaining OOD concenpts. So the Ruby is pretty eassy language I'm planning to learn its syntax, so it would be easier to understand whole thing. What do you think about that? Is there anyone Who switched from Ruby to c#/java was it worth that?

I just need to use a hash in a small app. Basically I should just show a hash, a function that uses the hash, then show the output in terminal.  
  
Separately, I need to do the same for arrays too, and for searching data. And also I need to show the output, and code, of a program sorting some data.  
   
This isn’t exactly a competence issue, it’s more of an imagination issue as I don’t even know what problem I’m solving here.  
  
In short, I need to write like 4 small programs, of only a few lines of code each and just run them in terminal. Any little nudges in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

I read everywhere on the Internet that Ruby is kinda slow compared to others "similar" languages (Python?)

Since Ruby is written is C, what makes it so slow?

Hi so I have installed a fresh copy of ruby 2.4.5 32-bit on Windows Server 2016. Ruby did previously work on this machine but I had 2.6.5 and I needed to downgrade to 2.4.5. When I got to the point of the installer when it was time to run ridk install I saw my command prompt flash and close. I cannot run ANY ruby commands or use the IRB through the command prompt. Strangely enough I have RubyMine installed and I can run scripts through that. Still no commands like IRB or bundle install.

&amp;#x200B;

Matter of fact even if I try to output ruby -v from the command prompt I get nothing.

[No Output](https://preview.redd.it/srv805174rc41.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce31c01d620cb6b6a70a39319c65b8d7c1beed1)

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to ask on StackOverflow ( [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59848729/all-ruby-commands-immediately-close](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59848729/all-ruby-commands-immediately-close) ) but didn't really get anywhere. It's kind of frustrating that even a re-install of ruby did not fix the issue. Not too sure what else to try.
