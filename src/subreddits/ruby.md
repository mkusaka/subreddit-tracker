I was thinking of using ruby to build a CLI tool like the glances or Top commands in linux . Ideally it's just a fun project for myself to learn about how ruby can interact with the system to get info like memory usage and CPU load. What do you guys think of this venture?

Not a regular Ruby user.  I'm trying to use bundle install to test out an application that I'm interested in self hosting.  I've gotten through most of the major pitfalls...but cannot figure out how to get the bundle to install libv8 successfully.

I was able to build the correct libv8 (7.3.492.27.1) by pulling the source from git and locally building the gem.  But the application's bundle keeps trying to Install it by pulling and compiling itself (the arch doesn't have a rubygems prebuilt?), and it keeps failing.  Is there a way to nudge it towards the locally built gem?

Thanks!

How often do you think about the bits -- the ones and zeroes -- that make up your app's data? If you're doing web development in Ruby there's rarely any need to. But what if you want to interact with the operating system or a piece of hardware? What if you'd like to understand network protocols or databases? In that case, a solid understanding of bitwise operators is foundational. 

In this article Jos√© M. Gilgado will introduce you to bitwise operations in Ruby, give practical examples of how they can be useful, and finish big with with some fun math tricks.
