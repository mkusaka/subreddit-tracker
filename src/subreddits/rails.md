## [3][Best ways to do RESTful authentication](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ew3pwo/best_ways_to_do_restful_authentication/)

I have finished my project and it's ready for being deployed. I used different technologies and tools such as MySQL and Devise. And of course, I asked a lot of questions (I can say at least 5 of them were in this sub :D) to learn more. 

Now, I have a bunch of questions and ambiguities. I have plans of having an android app for our app. I even talked to an android developer and she said she needs an API (which is not surprising) and these came to my mind : 

* For login, I can't simply send a string as password. I need a token authentication. But I couldn't find any clear explanation on how to do that. I found libraries and gems, but most of them had no clear documentation. I used devise for managing my users, so I of course need a way to do token authentication with devise. 
* As the project will be launched in a day or two, and the app takes time to be published, I have another ambiguity. How can force previous users to get a token? 
* And what about sign-ups? Isn't it unsafe to send information as plain text to the server? or sign-ups can have a token too? 

These were what came into my mind. I'll be thankful of your answers and discussions.

Hi there!

Over the past year, my team has built a number of Slack applications for internal tools, demos, and for fun. We found ourselves writing the same [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) code over and over again, so we decided to try and make it a bit easier for ourselves, and hopefully others too!

Inspired by Basecamp's [`google_sign_in`](https://github.com/basecamp/google_sign_in) gem, our goal was to make something that would let us integrate "Sign in with Slack" into our Rails apps:

* with minimal configuration
* as quickly as possible
* without sacrificing on long-term stability and maintainability

We recently open-sourced this [on GitHub](https://github.com/TEECOM/slack_sign_in) as a gem, and I also made a short [getting started video](https://vimeo.com/387819353) (my first one! :D). I'd love to hear what people think! :D

Hello,

I'm trying to use Zurb Foundation in a new project with Rails 6. As it's my first project with this new version, i'm a bit confused with the webpack system. Usually, i use the foundation-rails gem and everything works fine.

I've got the SCSS working, but i'm stuck with the JS (that is needed for some components). I've added jquery with yarn,added it to environment.js as stated on internet. Then, i try to import foundation and initialize it with the 

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $(document).foundation();
    });

And i'm getting the "foundation is not a function error". I've tried with foundation, foundation-sites, importing the JS file separately, but couldn't get it to work.

Does anyone have some ideas ?
## [7][redirection after sign up? (Devise)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/evplr3/redirection_after_sign_up_devise/)

Hey guys! 

I implemented the confirmation email system on my app and that was successful. Now, I have just one problem to solve. When a new user signs up, it returns to the front page. I want it to redirect to a page telling people "please confirm your email using the link we sent you". 

What should I do now? I have a registration controller for my users, which is in charge for recaptcha. Should I add anything else to that?

Hi guys, I've released part 2 of the new Reddit clone build in Ruby on Rails. I posted the first part of the build here about 1 week ago and it got some interest so this latest release might be helpful to anyone who enjoyed the previous video.

**Part 1:**

In this video I cover the setup of a new rails app, installing the devise gem and creating user accounts. Add functionality for users to create a new community/subreddit. Add functionality to create new posts for a community (using nested routes).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD6JvHKNPPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD6JvHKNPPM)

**Part 2:**

Add dropdown nav menu allowing users to view their profile, edit account settings and sign out. Extend devise to add first name, last name and username. Signed in users can subscribe to communities and create new posts within them. Add profile for users which shows some basic details and their recent posts. Add new comments table and allow subscribers to add comments to posts. Improve layout and design of our app frontend.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSj3pCT3r6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSj3pCT3r6Y)

**Part 3 (to be confirmed):**

Add ability to upvote / downvote posts and order them in their community based on popularity. Add user karma based on number of upvotes received on posts.  


The build is part of a collection of MVP's that I have been building after working in the tech startup space for some time and assisting in building minimum viable products.

I post new web app builds on YouTube using Ruby on Rails 6 so feel free to check out the channel and add some recommendations for upcoming builds.

## [11][Weird Devise error when new users signup](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/evfoq0/weird_devise_error_when_new_users_signup/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/evfoq0/weird_devise_error_when_new_users_signup/
---
OK, so I setup Devise on a Rails 6 app that I've created. Additionally, I followed the [email only signup](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Email-only-sign-up) instructions.

In general, everything seems ok *except* that a bunch of the users appear to be getting logged out during the signup process which causes them to click the reset password link. An anonymized version of the production log is below.

Any ideas on what might be causing this? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*From rotated app log* production.log  
13:52:05: new user  
13:52:07: signup  
13:52:08: /almost\_finished loads  
13:52:09: /newsletters loads? (can't say it's the same user for sure)  
13:52:13: email event received  
13:52:14: goes to /users/edit (involves users/registrations/edit.html.erb around this time)  
**13:52:15 signout happens (same user's IP from signup) -** "(No route matches \[GET\] "/users/sign\_out"):"  
13:52:15 starting /users/confirmation/new  
13:52:16 new post /users/confirmations with commit "**Send confirmation again**"  
13:52:16 mail event  
13:52:17 /users/sign\_in  
13:52:18 /newsletters redirect  
13:52:21 another "Send confirmation again"  
13:52:22 get /users/sign\_in  
13:52:22 /newsletters redirect  
13:52:22: /newsletters/9

## [12][How do you guys store constants that are model-specific and to be used for testing and validations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/evgsdl/how_do_you_guys_store_constants_that_are/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/evgsdl/how_do_you_guys_store_constants_that_are/
---
Example: Customers can either be a "Person" or "Company", nothing else.

Right now I'm thinking of making a method in Customer.rb:

&gt;def self.types  
&gt;  
&gt;\["Person","Company"\]  
&gt;  
&gt;end

Then I refer to it as Customer.types in my validations and Rspec files. I'm doing this as an attempt to be DRY, and to make it easier to add to this array in the future if needed.

Alternatively I can store it as a constant in config/initializers, but this isn't truly a global constant since it is model-specific.

Edit: Also, how do you guys store global constants that are NOT model-specific?

Thoughts?
