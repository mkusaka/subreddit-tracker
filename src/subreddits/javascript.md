I am in the process of limiting DOM calls for performance reasons. It will have a one 2d string array and one 3d int array containing all those information that currently are stored in &lt;b id="info"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. By doing this I hope that the wasm won't be slower than javascript as it is in current DOM-dependent build. My main objective is to lower the file size of index.js

Like any great Javascript library, React will eventually fade in its ubiquity at some point. Jquery, Backbone, Underscore, etc. They all peaked, and are now being drowned out by React (and/or Vue, Angular, etc.).

React is the hottest library on the block, but we know that there are certain parts of React that might even seem outdated today, and are ripe for disrupting.

For example, heavy javascript on page load, client-side deploys of React (Create React App) leading to poor SEO and/or mobile performance. An overly complicated set up process (such as configuring Webpack, Babel, and other compilers). Dependency bloat. The list goes on. React (and other front end frameworks) serve their purpose for the current state of Javascript in 2020, but I can definitely see newer and better tools becoming the hot new thing in the next few years.

Will it be the new version of Svelte, which has SSR + simpler set up + simpler syntax, etc? Will it be Web Components and/or Turbolinks, making any existing app into a performant SPA? Will we all go back to Jquery for some reason? Will there be something else? What do you think?

Hi, absolute noob here, but there is this cool animation on https://octo.fi/ where you click the mouse and octopuses fall explode out from the pointer. I love it. 

Looking to play with the code. 

How do would I insert the code into HTML and have it run? Would I be able to just paste the code between certain &lt;&gt; tags? Tried but getting nowhere. I am using r 

Code is here: https://github.com/octofi/octofidotcom/blob/master/js/emoji-pop.js

Any pointers would be amazing. Thanks in advance! ðŸ˜Š
