Hi Ruby friends!
Sorry, not sure what to title this. (also, on mobile)

So I'm getting back into Ruby after a couple years away, so I'm kind of a beginner yet, but I had an idea.
My workplace uses Python, which I had considered learning, but i don't really have a HUGE need to.... So what if knowing Ruby would allow me to be able to at least read and understand Python? Like how someone who knows Spanish can kinda get by understanding Italian or something.

Is that a concept that anyone feels like cold be plausible?

 Hey, I'm new to Ruby and need to practice in some small projects or so to get a grasp of the language. I'm learning from [Udemy.com](https://Udemy.com) but haven't completed whole. Currently finding some small project ideas so that I can have a clear understanding of whatever I have learnt from the course. I have completed till hashes and it would b great if you all can suggest me some small ideas that I can try out on Ruby. 

Though it's out of context I  just wanted to share that today I made a password authentication using Hashes and it just worked great!! I'm so badly excited to something more with ruby **ðŸ˜…**
## [6][bundle exec vs non bundle exec.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/g1weem/bundle_exec_vs_non_bundle_exec/)

Something we learned.  


Question is  â€“ which of these two should you use:

    # Call bundle exec before rake 
    $ bundle exec rake   
    
    # Call just rake 
    $ rake

â€˜bundle exec rakeâ€™ will look at what is written in your .gemspec/Gemfile while rake will use whatever is in your env.
