Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

My group is thinking about moving compiler versions and it would be useful to know if we should wait for c++20. When do we think GCC will have non-experimental support for it?

In this video https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/Interactive-Panel-Ask-Us-Anything- at around 15:25 Andrei Alexandrescu says that encoding lifetimes in the type system is a solved problem with a large body of research. Could anyone point out any specific references to such research?

I'm just curious... why does C++ use utility functions for stream error conditions that return booleans, such as cin.bad(), [cin.fail](https://cin.fail)(), and cin.eof() instead of  just throwing related exceptions to the caller?  

If i is an int, and (cin &gt;&gt; i) fails, why not throw a related exception like a type casting exception, or an end of file exception, and allow the caller to catch it, or not?

Yet on the other hand, dynamic\_cast&lt;&gt; will throw bad\_cast exceptions?  Respectfully, it seems like it's requiring an admixture of programming styles in what can easily be the the same top level code.

P.S. I am only asking because I am trying to learn modern C++ after some professional experience over a decade ago in C++98.  I am really energized to learn the new concurrency support in C++17, but in dusting off my memory to prepare, I am coming across things like this... and going... hey.... wait...
