Hi all, I'm new to app development and have hit a pretty bizarre obstacle to releasing my first app. I did a production release on Google Play's network two days ago and the *only* way I can find my app is by searching for it with underscores instead of spaces in the title. Will not show up by keywords, even if I type in the name verbatim. Also, my app still says "Internal Beta" even though my production release is definitely rolled out. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mv5lw0x?fbclid=IwAR3ZSVOkRESLheNqvNsFzyS5RUa_oGORL58ddpA4nxfyQPSAo8Rq9l77UYY) are two screenshots that show what I'm talking about.

I Googled the problem and was surprised to see many developers complaining about this. Check out [this 2k+ upvoted thread](https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/15162444?hl=en) of app makers complaining about this issue from approximately seventh months ago. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/dvsehg/app_do_not_show_in_playstore_search_without/) is a thread in this very subreddit about the same issue around the same time. And then there was also a [news article](https://www.neowin.net/news/google-fixes-play-store-bug-that-was-hiding-new-apps-from-search-results/) the same month that talked about how Google Play has supposedly fixed this bug. None of them seemed to give any clarity on the issue from Google's perspective or why it might still be going on, just saying that this was a "search indexing" issue. I still have no idea why my app can only be found with underscores, what I can do to fix it, or if there is simply a waiting period for new apps before they show up on searches.

Has anyone here experienced this issue? Google Play devs, are you reading this? It would make my day if someone can shed some wisdom on this issue for me!
## [7][I created this simple app that will notify you of any new releases to the current Android Jetpack libraries. You can also browse and bookmark specific libraries you're interested in for easier tracking. It's on GitHub and Play Store. Not sure if I'll add more features, but I'm open to suggestions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gyyhrm/i_created_this_simple_app_that_will_notify_you_of/)

I am a big fan of tv apps based on leanback tv , I came across a very simple apk (totally free from Google Play) and the streams are also free to air, but very limited,number, 
I was wondering if possible to modify the apk to add more links, more channels.
or would it just be easier to start of a new project using Google Leanback template. the app is

## [9][Does Google allow having apps on Huawei's app store?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gzn3wx/does_google_allow_having_apps_on_huaweis_app_store/)

I have been approached by Huawei and they want me to upload my apps to their store. They said they do not mind if I keep my apps on Google Play Store, but will Google mind? I cannot find anything in Google's terms and conditions.

 I'm assuming because developers are allowed to upload apps to Amazon store, it is perfectly OK?
## [10][AdMob very low ecpm](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gzn3gm/admob_very_low_ecpm/)

Hey

O create a simple app and add AdMob to it.
On the first week I got a ecpm between 0.40 and 0.60 which was ok.
Recently I have been seeing ecpm of 0.02.

Is there something that I can do to increase this?

Also the main screen in my app consist of a large list with a detail view. I added the add on the detail view only so when you go back to the list it is gone. Is it a better approach to display the add always on the screen?

Thanks for any help on this

Hi Everyone, 

Recently, Google announced an SMS/Call permission type permission request mechanism for [accessing a location in the background](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/02/safer-location-access.html). Have you submitted for the feedback from Google Play regarding your use case for background location permission? If so, What use cases are accepted and what use cases are rejected?
