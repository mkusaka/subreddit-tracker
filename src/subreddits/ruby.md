I've been digging into Rust for an embedded project and found that there is a lot more container types available.  I see implementations for SwissTable and other containers, lots to choice from based on if you want constant-time lookups vs quick insertion.  I'm having a hard time finding different implementations of containers in Ruby. Do they exist?  Is it even possible?  I'd love to be able to pickup a Gem that implements different container types and choice the correct implementation based on my needs.

Hey guys, i created a single-video tutorial aiming for programmers to learn Ruby. 

This tutorial goes through implementing an actual program (sorting numbers with quicksort).

It would be nice to get some feedbacks, i have plans to create similar videos for other languages.

I'm trying to build a grpc client. The grpc server has many protobuf files that define its api and so when I run protoc command to generate the sources I get a ton of ruby files (one for each protobuf). I'm having tough time trying to figure out how to load these into my project (as simple poc right now). Some of the generated sources require some of the others and that seems to be the problem. It's like they need to be loaded into the environment in a particular order which there must be a better solution for. Does this make sense to anyone?
