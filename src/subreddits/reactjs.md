Hi, 

Having applied for a few react jobs, I've noticed writing tests is essential if you want to be a react dev. I am trying to learn but I find it to be a steep learning curve and I'm having trouble knowing where to start.

I've built a small react app for a take home project and I need to test it. I just have some questions I could really use some help answering.

THE APP  
 \-fetch component which fetches json from endpoints depending on which option is selected on dropdown and pushes data to state array.

 \-Print component which creates a list with input tags from data with the (input + integer from json) being added to local state.

\- Receipt component which takes input from Print component as props and prints the sum

QUESTIONS

1) What part of the app should I be testing? How in general should I know what to test?

2) A lot of the articles I've read on testing show basic examples for e.g pure functions etc.. What is the best approach to take if my component depends on fetch requests or take props?

3) Between unit testing, snapshot testing, and end to end testing, which is the best for React apps?

Thanks

Sorry for posting this here, but /r/nextjs looks dead-ish.

I am refactoring a NextJS 8 application built with a $15 template which loads a tons of useless stuff. I am in the process of abstracting components and scoping the styles with styled-jsx for ease of maintainance. I noticed there are some global classes that are useful in the whole project, like `.justify { text-align: justify }`, so I thought those would be good candidates for global styles.

Is this the correct way to import the global styles in the whole project? I am kinda new to React and in my mind adding the `GlobalStyles` component in the `_app.js` means that EVERY component gets wrapped with the globals, possibly creating problems?

pages/_app.js:
```js
import GlobalStyles from "../components/shared/GlobalStyles";

// This default export is required in a new `pages/_app.js` file.
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;
      &lt;GlobalStyles /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
```

components/shared/GlobalStyles.js
```js
const GlobalStyles = () =&gt; (
  &lt;&gt;
    &lt;style jsx global&gt;
      {`
        .justify {
          text-align: justify;
        }
      `}
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/&gt;
);

export default GlobalStyles;
```

thanks!
