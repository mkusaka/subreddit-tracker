I've always been apprehensive about working with Javascript due to the lack of type safety confusing the shit out of me. Fortuntely we use Typescript for our React applications which I find easier to manage especially given the size and number of engineers working on it.

Unreal. It's incredibly intuituve and very straightforward to develop with.

My first exposure to any sort of application development was playing with Ionic 2 &amp; 3 in 2016, but I always despised it's coupling with Angular and figured that perhaps front end development wasn't for me and bailed on it.

I'm still not crazy about styling components, but boy building them out and wiring them up to API calls is a god damn breeze.

TLDR; React fucks

Suppose a parent component holds a list of data (id and text). This data is fetched from a database via an HTTP GET request. This component also has a list of subcomponents wherein each subcomponent contains an element which modifies the list on the parent component via another HTTP request (let's say DELETE in this case). Is it better to call the DELETE request within the subcomponent or is it better to call the DELETE request at the parent component?

Hello folks. I want to create a React app which can be a simple social media or e-commerce. But I have no idea about backend technologies. Is there a way to create react app without API? Firebase or strapi is enough for this? Is there any other technology like these?

Hi guys, I'm a bit new to animations and wanted to make something similar to Facebook live's reaction animation. I found Framer Motion to be easy to use for this purpose and have attempted remaking that feature but I'm a bit stuck on something. When I click on an emoji, the animation gets activated but I can't seem to unmount it after the transition has been completed.


If you view inspect element after an emoji has been fired, the div stays and doesn't get removed. I worry that this might impact performance even though it "works" technically. How can I fix this problem? My code can be found here: https://codesandbox.io/s/frosty-bardeen-xt6uq


Thanks!

Hello!

Im developing an app (duuh‚Ä¶) for a startup.

I‚Äôve been developing and programming native apps for quite a few years now, but am just now learning React Native.

Currently I‚Äôm working on an App for a startup, and I‚Äôm looking for some pointers. We aren‚Äôt looking to launch the app anytime soon, so I‚Äôm not in a hurry, but I just wanna make sure I get the hang of this from the beginning.

The app is gonna have some main features: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Playback Audio from a server (maybe firebase)
* Download said audio, and playback offline
* Authentication (again, maybe firebase)
* Small animations (probably Lottie)
* Subscriptions

What I‚Äôm thinking:

&amp;#x200B;

* React Native as front-end
* Firebase as back-end (maybe a Parse server, hosted on Back4App)
* Stripe for handling transactions and subscriptions.

I‚Äôm not looking for specific guidance on small features (like navigation, audio playback packages, UI packages).

Any experience, do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs or pointers are much appreciated.
