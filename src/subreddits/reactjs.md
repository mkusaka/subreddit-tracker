We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

My friend and I have ALMOST finished a super fun side project called Pastepanda ([https://try.pastepanda.com/early-access-beta](https://try.pastepanda.com/early-access-beta)): a library of copy-paste-ready and neatly coded sections for different kinds of web projects!! Boy, have we fought to get it out in the open! ðŸ˜…

After many iterations, going from an extremely wide scope to a more modest first version, we finally thought: letâ€™s just release the landing page and hope for the best.

Iâ€™m so pumped to hear what you all in the React community think!! ðŸ˜ƒ

We are looking for a good React.js developer (or agency) to help create a frontend UI/UX from an existing web API. We already have a frontend but want to move away from the current implementation to using React.js + the API.

&amp;#x200B;

The application that we want to redesign the frontend UI/UX of is; [https://wpvulndb.com/](https://wpvulndb.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone recommend a good developer or agency? Or, where I should be looking to find one?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Hey guys, today I made my first npm package, it's called **react-pagination-nav** 

 [https://github.com/mohitkyadav/react-pagination-nav](https://github.com/mohitkyadav/react-pagination-nav) 

I'm still a beginner, if you find any bugs or cool new feature requests, create an issue on the repo.

And you can find the package here.
