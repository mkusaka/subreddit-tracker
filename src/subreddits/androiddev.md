* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

What's the general consensus on giving senior devs a coding challenge and/or to make a sample app on job interviews? It's generally frowned upon right? Also what do you tell HRs that tell you that?

## [9][Firebase cloud messaging HTTP v1 send error - 400 Client Error](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f25l15/firebase_cloud_messaging_http_v1_send_error_400/)

Hello all,

All the while, I'm using Legacy HTTP to perform Firebase cloud messaging send. No problem so far.

Now, I try to implement a very simple Python code snippet, to perform Firebase cloud messaging HTTP v1 send.

However, I'm getting 400 Client error. I have no why.

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60164581/firebase-cloud-messaging-http-v1-send-error-400-client-error-bad-request-for](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60164581/firebase-cloud-messaging-http-v1-send-error-400-client-error-bad-request-for) 

Can anyone provide some insights, on what might possible go wrong? Thank you.

So, google demands that if an android game is being played by a kid then he should only see ads related to kid. Well, how do the game and ad will know that a kid is playing the game?

How can I create a ```GradientColor``` programmatically based on the angle of the current time on ```Canvas```?

For example if the current time is 3pm, I would like the gradient to start from 180 degree (or 0 degree?), and constantly update the angle of the gradient every 10 minutes?

Hello,   


I have a situation where the user gives permission but location services on their phone is turned off, making the action pretty much useless. How can I make sure that doesn't happen? I'm working on a solution with \`SettingsClient\` but I'm not sure if that's the right solution. Thank You!
