I heard that the biggest reason to choose Kotlin is not because it is a "new language", but because it is a "better java"! 

So I think I need some advice

[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source web framework created for Kotlin/JS. It allows developers to build modern web applications with the Kotlin language.

I have released KVision 3.7.0. The highlights of this release include:

* new server-side module with full support for the [Vert.x](https://vertx.io) backend (with examples and documentation)
* support for awesome toast messages based on [Toastr library](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/)
* support for method annotations for compiler plugin code generation
* many dependencies upgraded (including Kotlin 1.3.72, Jooby 2.8.1 and Tabulator 4.6.2)
* bugfixes and improvements for different components

This version contains also some workarounds for [jQuery breaking issue with 3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4665).

For more details about this release see the [changelog](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision/releases/tag/3.7.0). There are also some new fullstack example apps for Vert.x server in the [examples repository](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples).

Any feedback is appreciated!
## [7][Learning Kotlin by Writing an ElasticSearch Query DSL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/g51a4z/learning_kotlin_by_writing_an_elasticsearch_query/)

Hello everyone. I've recently decided to learn Kotlin for fun, and I'm currently writing an [Elastic Query DSL](https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/archia) for that purpose. I have chosen this project because Kotlin's DSL programming support was one of the major features that initially got me interested in the language. And I gotta say, as a full-time Scala developer, I'm actually pretty impressed by Kotlin and how easy it is to build DSLs without even resorting to features such as `implicits`. I find it to be a well-balanced language that resides somewhere between Java and Scala. 

Here is the code: https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/archia.

It's still not complete but I'll appreciate early feedbacks.

Which rest framework should I use?
I looking for a simple lightweight framework. I thought it could be Micronaut, or Ktor, what do you recommend?
