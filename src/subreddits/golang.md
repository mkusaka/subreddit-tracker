[https://github.com/db47h/decimal](https://github.com/db47h/decimal)

TL;DR This is a port of Go's big.Float to a big.Decimal. Compared to other similar packages out there, the API is identical to math/big, and it uses a decimal representation for the mantissa.

[Go: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](https://bluxte.net/musings/2018/04/10/go-good-bad-ugly)

In my first year of Go, I was thinking that it's good if we can also have Generic and other cool things out there in Go

But now I know why they want to keep Go as simple as it is.

I've seen a lot of complicated things build with Go

\- a function return an interface{} even 2 (interface{},interface{})

\- then overuse of reflection (reflect pkg)

....

Imagine you have all of those fancy functionalities in Go, how complicated is your code gonna be?
## [7][String references in closures](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/gs5mwj/string_references_in_closures/)

Say I had this

    func makeFilter(filterVal string) MyFilter {
        return func(s string) bool { return filterVal == s; }
    }

Is filterVal copied here for use in the closure, or underneath does it use a pointer to the original string? Is it better to capture the pointer to avoid a copy?
