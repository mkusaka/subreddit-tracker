We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

It's been about 4 years since I started my project, Resume on the Web, where I created a website that portrays who I am and my ever-changing personality. Every once in a while, I revamp the whole thing using new technologies so that I keep myself updated with the latest and greatest, and also gives me a creative outlet to experiment with new design ideas.

This year, I kicked it up a notch by revamping the design of the old boring two-column resume look, to something a lot more vibrant, responsive and effective. I'll keep my words to a minimum and let the website do the talking :)

**Introducing, the brand-new, Resume on the Web:**   
**https://amruthpillai.com/**

For those who want the technical deets, this version is built with GatsbyJS, a static-site React framework that I wanted to explore recently, as well as Tailwind CSS for the uber-cool utility classes.

As always, the source code for the project is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/AmruthPillai/ResumeOnTheWeb-Gatsby

Please do let me know if you liked it as much as I enjoyed making it! :)

---
I've been using hooks for a month or so now and while I can use them, I couldn't give a definition of what they are which covers all of them.

The documentation is pretty unhelpful. It describes them as "a special function that lets you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features." That doesn't really tell you anything.

Often they are explained in terms of what they replace, the componentDidMount etc lifecycle methods. But for people like me who learned hooks before learning those, that's also unhelpful.

What exactly do useState and useEffect have in common? What exactly is a hook?

What's the recommended way of handling the React frontend and the backend? What are the advantages and disadvantages of keeping one server for running both?

I am planning to develop a project running Django and React but I am unsure about the best practices here. Also, I wouldn't know how to deploy an app that is requires two different servers, how would that work?

Hey guys, we've been working for quite some time on this library, the focus is really mainly on design, how pretty it is as well as development usability, simple and intuitive API and so on. We'll add more components soon that are missing, such as dialogs etc. Please feel free to drop any feedback!

1. Was researching about NextJS and was told to not use database logic in serverless functions. 
2. The first point contradicts the official documents. Official documents strongly advise you to not have a custom server unless really needed but in which scenario would you really need to do to use the custom server?
3. Do you really need nginx if you have a serverless function using NextJS?

I made a simple python command-line tool that creates a flask and react application boilerplate to build off of. I had to rebuild my flask and react apps a lot with work and personal projects, so I made it easier for myself. Hope others can find use in it.

Hi guys. I'm making a dragged image. It works as it should. I also have buttons that scale the image. after scaling, the drug works but it cuts the position. I can't find the right words to describe this behavior.At the first movement the image changes its position slightly

what calculations do I need to do too. to get a smooth drag, after scaling an element.
