I want to give a talk at my company to embrace Kotlin. We are currently a Java shop and I believe that since we are going to be addressing some technical debt, we might as well clean stuff up.

I am supposed to give a presentation on Kotlin soon and I wanted to know how do the presenters at KotlinConf make the presentations. In particular, how do they get the code snippets to fold, expand, and change as they give their talks. 

Thanks in advance

Does anyone have any good resources for learning android for Kotlin? Like starting from downloading the program to beginning your first app

Worst title ever, right?

Here's the issue. I have a sealed class and I would like a class and its inner class to both be members of the sealed class. It works if the class is nested in the sealed class but not if it's not nested. Is this a bug?

This one works:  

    sealed class Foo {
        class Bar : Foo() {
            inner class Baz : Foo()
        }
    }

This gets an error: "Cannot access '&lt;init&gt;': it is private in 'Foo'"

    sealed class Foo
    
    class Bar: Foo() {
        inner class Baz: Foo()
    }
