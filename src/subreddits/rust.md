Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jdwuis/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

I’ve been looking into Rust a lot recently as I become more interested in lower-level programming (coming from C#). Safe to say, there’s a *very fair* share of praise for Rust as a language. While I’m inclined to trust the opinions of some professionals, I think it’s also important to define what weaknesses a language has when considering learning it.

If instead of a long-form comment you have a nice article, I certainly welcome those. I do love me some tech articles.

And as a sort-of general note, I don’t use multiple languages. I’ve used near-exclusively C# for about 6 years, but I’m interesting in delving into a language that’s a little bit (more) portable, and gives finer control.

Thanks.

Hello everyone. Im about to go to university and looking forward to do software development/engineering in the future but here is the problem - what language should I use? I think most people will answer "learn c++, it's fast, modern and etc." but I have recently discovered Rust, and on paper it looks even better than c++. I read some posts about this specific topic (c++ or Rust) and indeed, Rust looks really promising but I'm still wondering if C++ is still worth learning, so I decided to ask this, is it worth learning both c++ and Rust at the same time? What are the disadvantages of this approach? I know there are many people here who switched from C++ to Rust, can you please tell me why you did this, and how has your life as a programmer changed since then? Thanks in advance.

Hi folks, I've been working on this crate for quite some time, it's my first crate. It let you use a image that contains your own handwritten letter to write anything. I've made this to improve my Rust skills, you can found all about it at [https://crates.io/crates/handmade](https://crates.io/crates/handmade), hope you all enjoy it! The documentation is under construction, but the code is straight forward, and there is an exemple at Readme to help you use this. Please post your results or questions here! I'll be glad to help.
## [10][audiotags: Parse common metadata in most audio file formats with ease](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ji2nns/audiotags_parse_common_metadata_in_most_audio/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ji2nns/audiotags_parse_common_metadata_in_most_audio/

There are different crates dedicated for parsing metadata in different file formats: [id3](https://crates.io/crates/id3), [mp4ameta](https://crates.io/crates/mp4ameta), [metaflac](https://crates.io/crates/metaflac). While they each provide comprehensive support for the type of metadata they specialize at, their API is not quite consistent and it can be difficult to parse a heterogeneous set of audio files.

I created the [audiotags](https://crates.io/crates/audiotags) crate ([GitHub](https://github.com/TianyiShi2001/audiotags)) which targets most real-world use cases where the audio files are heterogeneous and the metadata we're interested in are limited (we rarely need to parse the 'remixer' or 'performer webpage', for example (they are rarely documented in files in the first place)). With **audiotags**, you can read the most common and useful metadata (e.g. title, album) with a unified, simple API, like this (showing how to read tags from mp3, m4a, and flac files, modify them and write them to files ):

    use audiotags;
    fn main() {
        const MP3: &amp;'static str = "お願い！シンデレラ.mp3";
        let mut tags = audiotags::read_from_path(MP3).unwrap();
        println!("Title: {:?}", tags.title());
        println!("Artist: {:?}", tags.artist());
        tags.set_album_artist("CINDERELLA PROJECT");
        let album = tags.album().unwrap();
        println!("Album title and artist: {:?}", (album.title, album.artist));
        println!("Track: {:?}", tags.track());
        tags.write_to_path(MP3).unwrap();
        // Title: Some("お願い！シンデレラ")
        // Artist: Some("高垣楓、城ヶ崎美嘉、小日向美穂、十時愛梨、川島瑞樹、日野茜、輿水幸子、佐久間まゆ、白坂小梅")
        // Album title and artist: ("THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA GIRLS ANIMATION PROJECT 01 Star!!", Some("CINDERELLA PROJECT"))
        // Track: (Some(2), Some(4))
        const M4A: &amp;'static str = "ふわふわ時間.m4a";
        let mut tags = audiotags::read_from_path(M4A).unwrap();
        // without this crate you would call mp4ameta::Tag::read_from_path()
        println!("Title: {:?}", tags.title());
        println!("Artist: {:?}", tags.artist());
        let album = tags.album().unwrap();
        println!("Album title and artist: {:?}", (album.title, album.artist));
        tags.set_total_tracks(4);
        println!("Track: {:?}", tags.track());
        tags.write_to_path(M4A).unwrap();
        // Title: Some("ふわふわ時間")
        // Artist: Some("桜高軽音部 [平沢唯・秋山澪・田井中律・琴吹紬(CV:豊崎愛生、日笠陽子、佐藤聡美、寿美菜子)]")
        // Album title and artist: ("ふわふわ時間", Some("桜高軽音部 [平沢唯・秋山澪・田井中律・琴吹紬(CV:豊崎愛生、日笠陽子、佐藤聡美、寿美菜子)]"))
        // Track: (Some(1), Some(4))
        const FLAC: &amp;'static str = "意味-無-ジュニーク・ニコール.flac";
        let mut tags = audiotags::read_from_path(FLAC).unwrap();
        // without this crate you would call metaflac::Tag::read_from_path()
        println!("Title: {:?}", tags.title());
        println!("Artist: {:?}", tags.artist());
        let album = tags.album().unwrap();
        println!("Album title and artist: {:?}", (album.title, album.artist));
        tags.set_year(2017);
        println!("Year: {:?}", tags.year());
        tags.write_to_path(FLAC).unwrap();
        // Title: Some("意味/無/ジュニーク・ニコール")
        // Artist: Some("岡部啓一")
        // Album title and artist: ("NieR:Automata Original Soundtrack", Some("SQUARE ENIX"))
        // Year: Some(2017)
    }

Currently this crate is not stable. I post it here to check whether I am re-inventing the wheel. If it is considered valuable, I will continue developing it. I don't have much experience in Rust, so feel free to open an issue or submit a PR to correct by bad design!

## [12][IDE experience with rust-analyzer on VSCode vs. Vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ji342x/ide_experience_with_rustanalyzer_on_vscode_vs_vim/)

I'm very much a beginner when it comes to IDE backends and tooling. I am hoping I can gain some education and enlightenment regarding a few questions I had:

1. I am curious what is the feature behind rust-analyzer's integration with VSCode that allows me to see "background info" of types on each line e.g.

[This is particularly nice when chaining multiple lines of combinators with a bunch of types I am less familiar with.](https://preview.redd.it/0doaxil5lbv51.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b30d453fdb3bd7ff3f859b0f1c8e55f5a124b8a)

Edit for 1: These are called "inlay hints" apparently and are covered in [https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hh6cue/any\_way\_to\_make\_vim\_do\_this\_for\_rust/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hh6cue/any_way_to_make_vim_do_this_for_rust/)

2.  Is there a way to enable such functionality in Vim? And which Vim setups for Rust have people found the most success with (code-completion, goto, linting, formatting, etc.)? I have found that rust-analyzer + VSCode is surprisingly powerful on its own.

Edit for 2: I have looked at/attempted a couple different setups/guides. The functionality I was referencing was specifically for that type highlighting feature that appears on VS Code pretty seamlessly. My latter question is regarding the experience people have had integrating Rust support for Vim (possibly in comparison to VSCode).

Thank you in advance for your responses!
