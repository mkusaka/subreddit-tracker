I can't describe how horrible this experience was.  I am not looking forward to how much work I am going to have to do to get my money back.  This is not my first AWS certification (I have SA Pro and DevOps Pro), but is my first online exam.  The short version is: Don't take AWS exams via the Pearson Vue at home option, even if it is offered.  AWS should not be offering this option as I can attest it is a waste of time.  Ironically, AWS would have us use their services because of their high availability and scaling but apparently they don't ask their test partners to do the same!

It started off easy enough: I passed the initial 'checks' as it confirmed my internet speed, camera access, and microphone access.  I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.  I tried again, and then a third time.  Same experience.  As I write this, I left it on that page and the spinning is continuing.  This screen has been spinning for no less than 45 minutes.  At 8 minutes before my scheduled exam, I tried finding the help link.  A chat window opened, and I waited, and waited, and waited.  Still waiting as I write this.  My chat window has been open for 52 minutes and still no one to help.  Every two minutes I get ' All agents are currently assisting others. Thank you for your patience.' written in the window.  OK - what next?  They make it harder to find, but I got a phone number I can call.  I tried calling that.  Busy signal.  For the next 20 minutes I called back and back, busy signal.  Finally, I got it to actually pick up, but of course no human yet.  No estimate of time to when I can be helped.  They don't even have nice elevator music to listen to.  Who knows when I will be able to talk to someone.  This has been an exceedingly poor experience.

If you value your time, please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt a online exam with Pearson.  I worked hard to prepare for this exam and rescheduled things to fit around it.  Now, I will have to do that all again.

u/jeffbarr Is this the experience AWS is hoping to get with their testing partners?  This was a waste of my time and money.  Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.

For what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.

*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.  I am actually quite surprised.

so i have an ec2 instance with same VPC/SecurityGroup as an RDS.. but i cant seem to connect to it ðŸ“·  
i have even added in a custom inbound rule so ec2 can connect to RDS.. but still no luck ;/

&amp;#x200B;

Ec2 instance was created first.. with VPC/security group.. the mysql is currently in it so i am trying to 'extract' it out so the first step is creating an RDS...   


tried sshing into ec2 instance and mysql -h ... and it just hangs...

Am I correct in thinking that:

Amazon Linux 2 EC2 price = Centos7 EC2 price ?

With RedHat7 price slightly more expensive than AL2/Centos7 ?

For cost reasons, I'm investigating migrating our custom built AMIs from centos7 to AL2.  I assumed AL2 would be cheapest of the 3 variants, but if AL2 is the same price as Centos7, then I don't really see much point migrating.

eu-west-1, c4.large, on-demand.  I assume "Linux on demand cost" in the excellent below link is AL2 (or Centos7) ?

Hi guys.  
I hope everyone is well :)

I've been working on the Well-Architected Framework for a while and the customers adherence seems to be very low.

I believe the problem here is related to the costs. Customers tend to look at the 5k USD credits the program offers, but the point is: the more remediations, more expensive is the consulting. In the end, the 5k USD credits barely pays the consulting. With this in mind, I would like to hear from this group how you guys been dealing with this situation. Are you struggling in different ways or having the same problems? How is your strategy here, if you can share  :)

## [7][How do you organize your CDK stacks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hrj5tv/how_do_you_organize_your_cdk_stacks/)

Hi /r/aws,

Recently we've been capturing our existing infrastructure (mostly configured through the console + CLI) as code by using the CDK. We're very happy with the tool as it allows us to translate our infrastructure very quickly (as opposed to raw CloudFormation through YAML/JSON). However, we are currently trying to figure out how best to structure/organize our stacks.

Since the CDK is still fairly new, we've been looking into CloudFormation best practices for organizing our stacks. [The official documentation](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) seems to recommend organizing your stacks **by lifecycle**. However, [another good thread on this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/en5ieo/cdk_everything_in_one_stack/) has /u/birdgovorun [making some good points](https://old.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/en5ieo/cdk_everything_in_one_stack/fduxsz2/) as well: let the stack separation be guided **by the domain**. Another [set of notes](https://github.com/kevinslin/open-cdk#stacks) also seems to recommend grouping resources according to service/purpose instead of strictly by lifecycle.

For us this contradicts the CloudFormation docs recommendation of organizing by lifecycle a bit, as we would have to put the lambda's into their own stack. When guided by our domain, it makes more sense to have a stack put together certain lambda's with the resources they act upon. As an example: we have a lambda that operates upon a Kinesis stream (i.e. as an event source). The lambda here is changed more often and thus according to the "by lifecycle" philosophy we would put it in a separate stack (maybe with other lambda's).

**I tend to prefer the philosophy of letting the domain guide the CDK stack organization**. In addition, it seems that the lifecycle recommendation stems from a time where stacks could still end up in a failed state without any way to recover from it. **I wonder whether (such) a non-recoverable stack state is still possible when for example changing a lambda?**

During development, I've noticed that when quickly creating a test event for the lambdas in the console, the stack would end up in a failed state due to drift. However, these drift situations will of course not happen in a setting where everything is deployed through CloudFormation.

That being said, if there's any possibility of having a CloudFormation stack end up in failed state in production such that it would require the recreation of stateful resources (DDB tables, etc.) then I would rather organize the stacks by lifecycle. In that way, I am at least sure that the probability of that happening is a lot lower since resources that change more often will be in a separate stack.

**My main question then is if anybody has any recommendations on this topic? Or maybe any (regretful?) experience with splitting up their CF stacks by domain instead of by lifecycle or vice-versa?**
It seems like this is something that we have to get right from the beginning, as changing it later will be a pain.

Thank you!

With the dc/ds Redshift nodes, you must always use at least two with one acting as a leader node.  Is this also true of the newer ra3 node types?  I assume yes but want to confirm.

Hi all
There is work load that I need to run each month on 10th.
For this I need 10 more EC2 instances which should be running for at most 24 hour to finish of the job. 
Since I need to run them on a particular date each month and I want them to run for 24 hr without interrupting. Can I use spot to lower the price. As far as I know I spot can interupt the ecosystem if the pricing go down.
