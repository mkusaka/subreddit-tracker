Hello there üëãüèæ

I've been writing react for a little over a year, but have also kept my eyes on mobile development. I recently decided to explore cross-platform mobile development with react native.

As a RN beginner, I'm trying to get into the react-native community and make a few friends. I'm on twitter as [@vick\_onrails](https://twitter.com/vick_OnRails). I'll be majorly twitting about my [30 days of react-native](https://github.com/vickOnRails/react-native-30/) exercise

If you have experience with RN, I'd love to follow and get to know you on Twitter.

Thanks üòä

## [6]["Flatten The Curve" Pandemic simulator...built entirely in React!](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iokz9m/flatten_the_curve_pandemic_simulatorbuilt/)

Here's an early version of my simulator: [https://flattenthecurve.zaklaughton.dev](https://flattenthecurve.zaklaughton.dev)

I wanted to get a better idea of how pandemic measures such as mask usage and social distancing can help the effects of a pandemic. This is an early version of a simulator I built in React to help visualize it!

People who are **socially distanced** have a moderately lower chance of movement, transmission, and infection.

People who are **wearing masks** have a slightly lower chance of getting infected, and a significantly lower chance of transmitting infections to others.

Visit the site, hit the **PLAY** button, adjust the numbers, and let me know what you think!

Hi!  üòÑ   
I wrote an article about how you should **Correctly import your packages into your project to improve bundle size.**

I'd appreciate any feedback, and how can the article be improved further.

They said it couldn't be done, but the newly released version 2.2 of Kea now comes with native support for TypeScript!

Because logic in Kea is written in a very funky way, I had to build a clever workaround to get this support. Read on for more details!

I already prefer to host my Postgres db on AWS, but I'm really trying to save a bit on the hosting of the site itself. Heroku was okay, but I always had issues, had to restart the server, etc. which I just can't have for this site.

I'd love to find something else that's $10-20/mo to host both my node server and my React app. Unless you guys think they should be on separate services...I thought I always read it was faster to keep them together.

I have a little experience with Digital Ocean with a Django site I did a while back, but I'm not super savvy when it comes to that stuff. If you guys say it's the best way to go though, I'll figure it out.

Any advice would be great. Just looking for something reliable, and bonus points if it's pretty easy to deploy/update.

Thanks
## [10][Is React REALLY more difficult to learn than Vue?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iosns1/is_react_really_more_difficult_to_learn_than_vue/)

Long story short, I‚Äôve been dabbling with both Vue and React to see what resonates with me. When I started I thought Vue would be the answer, as I always hear how it is easier to learn than React. 

I haven‚Äôt found that to be the case though. With React, I already know Javascript, and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm writing. Only different is dealing with state. With Vue, I need to learn all the little Vue specific templating. All the v-for, v-bind, etc is just something else that I need to learn on top of everything else. 

Anyone else had the same experience? For me, I‚Äôm finding React simpler to wrap my head around than Vue.

Hello devs of  r/reactjs!

I built a frontend Netflix clone using React and Redux to learn hooks in a practical manner. As this has been my first real project using React, I would really love it if you could take a look at the website, and, more importantly, the code. Any feedback at all would be a godsend.
