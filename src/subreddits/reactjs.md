## [9][Where should you decide the width of an element?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hnf8bi/where_should_you_decide_the_width_of_an_element/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hnf8bi/where_should_you_decide_the_width_of_an_element/
---
I'm absolutely new to react and pretty new to html. To prove this I shall ask the following question:

Where is it the most appropriate to determine the width and height of an element? Is it preffered to: 

A: return an element which has a class that sets the width to be, lets say: X %.

B: return an element that in itself doesn't have a size restriction, but then returning into a container in which the element is given X columns. 

Hope you understand the question. 

Thanks!

Hello everyone, I've been working on a personal project revolving around the Podcasting space.

I want to make an embeddable Podcast player with Waveforms that my users could.embed into their websites, somewhat like Clyp.it 

I've used VanillaJS for waveforms but it's not very optimal tbh.

Any ideas on how to go about this?

Thanks!

## [12][[Question] What is the correct way to use react-redux hooks for data?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hne49c/question_what_is_the_correct_way_to_use/)

The title pretty much explains my question.  


Hi, im refreshing myself with React, working on a small project.  
My architecture is pretty simple: MainPage that used as a controller, and MessagesComponent  as child component (data is passed down to the child via props).  
Now I connected Redux to my whole ecosystem to fetch/post data. and my question is:   
What is the best practice for such thing? Who should use the react-redux useSelector hook? is it the MainPage controller, passing down the data via props, or the child function component MessageComponent?
