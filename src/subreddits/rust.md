Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ijvwsk/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

A quine is a simple script that prints it's source. After playing around with the RustBot in the Rust Programming Discord, I realized it actually marks all the output code blocks with the \`rust\` language tag, giving it Rust markdown. I then knew what I had to do next.

    fn main() {
        macro_rules! script {() =&gt; {"fn main() {{\n\tmacro_rules! script {{() =&gt; {{{:?}}}}}\n\tprintln!(script!(), script!());\n}}"}}
        println!(script!(), script!());
    }

It's as simple as it gets. Macro is used so we can reference the string twice (println! requires a string literal as the first argument), and then we format it with itself.

Try it out for yourself [here](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=6145572e99a52183c707980d3618d648)!

There is [https://github.com/mesalock-linux/mesalock-distro](https://github.com/mesalock-linux/mesalock-distro) but last commit is from 2018-11-12.

I would like to try such distro using only what is needed to run all applications written in Rust.

Some low-level stuff would need to be in C/C++ but we already have nushell, smithay etc.  


My goal would be to have cargo manage dependencies and some minimal/existing? pacakge manager for C/C++ deps.
