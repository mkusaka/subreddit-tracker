Hey guys!

I've come from IDE RubyMine, but I really want to simplify my experience and start using VS Code.

Everything is more or less okay, or at least you can used to VS Code experience except '.erb' files. It can either thread them as 'html' which completely kill Ruby experience either like Ruby files, but it's even more mess.

How do you usually work with '.erb' files?

It's very strange not to find any discussion anywhere regarding the move of the Devise repo. Am I missing it?

Different Google/Reddit/DDG searches turn up nothing--I've never seen that before for something so widely used. No blog posts or issues discussions threads or other announcements that I can find, and kind of a random and empty new home for the repo.

Commentary on the state of the Rails community? (Were it a Node module I'd think there'd be an explosion of posts.)

I am currently working on a project and project has some scaffolds belonging to the user. It's ok and I've done these parts. Now, I have a question. 

First, Imagine I have a scaffold called "expenses" and it is only accessible from registered users. 

Second, I want a user to be able to see "only" her own expenses. 

Is that possible? if yes, how? Thanks a lot. 

P.S : Sorry for bad English, I'm not a native English speaker.

I have installed `ffi` and when I tried to check the `jekyll -v` I have gotten this error message:

What would be the classification of these tests in Rails?

* Unit tests would be testing models and services?
* Integration tests would be testing controllers?
* E2E would be testing the front-end behaviour with capybara?
## [7][Is there a trick to using Rails 6/React/Redux?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/esze1e/is_there_a_trick_to_using_rails_6reactredux/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/esze1e/is_there_a_trick_to_using_rails_6reactredux/

I'm building an app that uses Rails 6 and React. Everything works great and smooth. I decided to add Redux in the way that I know how with just React. I'm not able to get any data into the redux store and show up in console.log. Is there some step I need to take care of in order to work in Rails 6? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my \`App.js\`:

&amp;#x200B;

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
    import { Provider } from "react-redux";
    import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'; // we get our store from redux library and we need middleware to wire up Thunk
    import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
    import reducers from './reducers/rootReducer'; 
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
    
    const store = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));
    
    // this is how you hook up
    store.subscribe(() =&gt; {
        console.log('the new state is', store.getState()); 
        consoel.log('----------');
    });
    
    
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {
        ReactDOM.render(
            &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
            &lt;Dashboard /&gt;
            &lt;/Provider&gt;,
            document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('div')),
        )
    });

So I'm writing an api and long story short I'm running into a few headaches when it comes to sending/receiving the param for my nested\_attributes without some sort of workaround on the front end. I was just wondering if I could renaming my permitted params for my `hours_attributes` to just `hours`?

Error about width and height (random?).

I created the AMP pages on my website. To add the &lt;amp-img&gt; we usted this system:

in helpers/application\_helper.rb there is this:

      def amp_image_tag(url, options = {})
        options[:width], options[:height] = *safely_extract_image_size(url) unless options[:width]
        content_tag('amp-img', nil, options.merge(src: asset_url(url)))
      end
    
      def safely_extract_image_size(url)
        FastImage.size(asset_url(url))
      rescue StandardError =&gt; e
        Rails.env.development? ? raise(e) : Rails.logger.warn(e)
        [640, 480]
      end

and in the view page, we just made this:

      &lt;% @movie.screens.each do |screen| %&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;%= amp_image_tag(screen.file.url(:medium), alt: @movie.title, layout: 'responsive') %&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;

In amp-img tag, the width and height values are obligatory.

I don't undestad why but sometime those values are showed and sometime they miss.

What is wrong?

p.s. the images have different sizes. They are uploaded by users.

I'm building an app from scratch using Rails and React. Is there any boilerplate project out there that has a simple log in page and Devise (or other authentication gem) configured that I can work off of? The closest thing I can find is thoughtbot's https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance
## [11][asdf version manager and bundle exec question](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/esi2s7/asdf_version_manager_and_bundle_exec_question/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/esi2s7/asdf_version_manager_and_bundle_exec_question/
---
I'm hoping some asdf users here can shed some light on this for me:

I recently set up a new machine and used thoughtbot's laptop script to speed up the process. one of the things it setups for it asdf as your version manager. i come from using rvm, but i was interested in giving asdf a try anyway.

a new coworker of mine also set her machine up similarly and is also using asdf as her version manager.

i'm having to prepend bundle exec before executing gem commands like rspec, sidekiq or rails, but NOT before running rake tasks

my coworker does NOT have to prepend bundle exec for anything. we checked her zshrc file and she doesn't have any bundle exec aliases either.

Why am i having to prepend bundle exec and she doesn't? Why is it specific to gems so far and not rake? Is it typical with asdf to have to prepend it without an alias?
