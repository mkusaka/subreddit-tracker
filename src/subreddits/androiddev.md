This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

## [3][I created this simple tile that shows local ip address. Helps when I'm switching networks and have to connect my phone wirelessly. It's on GitHub. Works on same network. It just displays the ip. Nothing else. In tile. (Initial) I'm working on unity, and this helps.

Hello Everyone, I have developed a sound board(In Java) where each sound is played when button is pressed , the mediacontroller uses the tag name which is the same as the mp3 name in the resources , please how would i go about setting maybe on a long press of the button to set that sound as a notification or ringtone? I have tried lots of things followed a few tutorials but nothing seems to work.  Your help would be much appreciated indeed.

thankyou

Hi All  
I've created **Anuvaad** *(translation in Hindi),* an open source tool that you can use to localize your Android Apps!

It supports majority of global languages, i.e. Hindi Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Russian. I plan to add more as the community requires.

You can translate your entire strings.xml file into any of these languages within **few seconds.**

 Please check it out: [https://swapnil1104.github.io/ReactAnuvaad/](https://swapnil1104.github.io/ReactAnuvaad/)

Check out the source code at  [https://github.com/swapnil1104/ReactAnuvaad](https://github.com/swapnil1104/ReactAnuvaad)

Open to all feedback, and please raise feature requests at the Github repository!
