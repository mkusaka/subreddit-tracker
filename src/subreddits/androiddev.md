I recently came back to Android development and found out about Navigation Components but I'm having a hard time seeing its appeal:

my currents concern are:

1. it requires you to register both the source and destination fragments in xml. This means all there isn't a dynamic way of ~~accessing~~ creating a fragment from another screen. I feel like this can either be a pro or con depending on how declarative you want your xml to be be
2. it doesn't seem to have any advantages over fragment transcations and feel more cumbersome to work with because of the xml required to work with it.

Since it's been out for a while now, I wanted to see if anyone using it had any opinions or experiences to share about it :) Cheers!

To anyone who's ever fallen foul of Google Play policies and had your Google Play Developer account terminated...

Did you have your whole Google Account shut down, or did you just lose access to just your Dev account, but keep everything else like Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar etc)?

So this is from an app I made 5 years ago in high school. 

To learn Unreal Engine 4 , I decided to make a game and put it on google paly to test it out. Importantly, it was only ever distributed using the "Closed Alpha" track, as internal testing didn't exist (not sure if it would have mattered). Now, because I was a stupid kid I had all the permissions turned on. Last year, I was informed the app had been removed due to data policy violation (surprise surprise), didn't think much of it. Now, I'm trying to close down my google developer account to consolidate under a different email but they refuse to delete this app because I installed it on my phone 5 years ago under closed alpha.

Then, I'm like ok well ill just update it. 

Well remember, I was a stupid kid and had deleted not only the source code, but the KEYSTORE TOO, meaning I have no way of fixing this data policy violation, as they want it to be visible in app too.

So, is there any possible way for me to get out of this? I seem to remember that google will remove apps if you no longer have the rights to the IP, could I just "sell" the IP to a friend or something and have the app removed that way? 

TL;DR I was a really dumb kid, now I'm stuck with a removed app I can't update, what do?

Tried every tutorial possible over the last 7 days, all to just to display a map and nothing works. Tried android docs, Google docs, tons of youtube videos and just nothing. Has anyone ever implemented a map inside of a fragment? Just need to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks in advance

I am looking for a Java/Android App tutor who can help me gain intermediate proficiency. I have little programming experience, but a great understanding of how programming languages function and general common sense. This kind of stuff comes very easy to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to learn in a period of about a week, I'm available almost throughout the entirety of the day, and would like to take advantage of that as much as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I learn best when taught in a fast paced environment, and can't muster enough attention to sit down and use one of the many free code learning sites available.   


I will be paying as well, in whatever your currency is. We can discuss a fair rate as well as any other questions you may have over a Discord call. DM me if you're interested!

&amp;#x200B;

Mods, if this post goes against the rules please LMK and I will take it down.
