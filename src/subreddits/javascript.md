Yesterday at Svelte Summit, Rich Harris announced what the future of Svelte will look like and... wow! It is exciting!

We're basically going to enter 2021 with a feature complete next-gen SSR framework on top of next-gen developer workflow with heavy support from both the Svelte and Snowpack teams.

To quote a fellow developer who spearheaded the HMR support for Svelte: "This thing will essentially occupies the first spot of comparisons across frameworks on every marks for quite some time, all while being the simplest to use".

Im writing a school assignment where I'm supposed to make something similar to glMatrix (a library for matrix and vector operations mostly used for computer graphic). 

Im wondering is there a big performance difference between using for loops for matrix multiplication vs. hard coding the indexes for a 4x4 matrix multiplication?
