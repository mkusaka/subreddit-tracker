Aside from read the Go spec and the usual well written blog posts on the official Golang blog, it's hard to find well written in-depth articles on the inner workings of the language (as opposed to the myriad of literature on how to build stuff with Go).

Here's a couple of articles I recently enjoyed reading:

* Error handling practices in Go
https://banzaicloud.com/blog/error-handling-go/

* Go: String &amp; Conversion Optimization
https://medium.com/a-journey-with-go/go-string-conversion-optimization-767b019b75ef

If you have come across others, please do share!

Since v0.0.3, [Gold](https://github.com/go101/gold) supports making statistics for the analyzed packages now.

Here are two demos: [the statistics of Go standard packages](https://docs.go101.org/statistics.html) and [the statistics for the kubernetes projects](https://imgur.com/a/ve7LFM4).

Any feedback is welcomed!

I have a window with a button the button executes a function on click which perform a 20 min long process I am doing this like

    func onBtnClick() { 
        labe.SetText("Process start")
        go func() {
            _, err := glib.IdleAdd(orgProcess) 
        }() 
    }
    
    func orgProcess() { 
        time.Sleep(time.Minute * 20) 
    }
