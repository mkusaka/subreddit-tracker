Hey all,

One of my apps has been on the Play Store for about 3 months now. Since then I've been trying to get my app ranked in searches but have been mostly unsuccessful as it seems trapped in a bit of a loop.

My understanding is that in order to rank for certain keywords you need to have people search for that word and then download your app, which makes sense.

But how do you do this when your app isn't ranking in the top 100 for that keyword in the first place?

I've seen people recommend running ad campaigns, but as an indie developer my budget is quite limited. Also seen people recommend paid download services, but this feels like a blackhat tactic that might bite me in the ass in the long run.

The little funds that I had have been spent on ASO services, as I've been told that would have the biggest impact, but it has not significantly improved the results.

Can anyone offer some insight into what a low budget launch strategy looks like in order to get your app ranked?

Hello.

Iv made a large amount of changes to my current released game, pretty much everything has changed except the screen-touch code and what happens when condition is met and maybe 2% of original graphics remain. Although the game is still the same subject and games name, everything else has been reworked and improved.

My concern is the update process , i have only made little fixes and added small amounts of content in previous updates so im unsure how google update process works when updating a game that could be considered a new game.

So my question to the experienced devs , Will this just update original file with new one or will google flag me and tell me to make a new release ? or any other pitfalls i can expect ?

## [12][LiveData .postValue vs .subscribeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gdb84w/livedata_postvalue_vs/)

In my view models I have a lot of RxJava streams which almost always end with

```
.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
.subscribe({
    liveData.value = it
} , {...})
```

Would there be any value of using `postValue` instead and not switching the observing thread? Would one potentially be more efficient than the other or is it negligable?
