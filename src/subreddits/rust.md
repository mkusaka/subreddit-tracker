Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hurj77/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hey, folks. I just dropped the newest episode of my Software Engineering podcast, The Virtual World. Some of you may have caught the most recent episode where I interviewed Steve Klabnik. This episode is a similar format featuring Alex Crichton from Mozilla. He's been working directly on Rust and the Web Assembly tooling for almost 6 years.

Interview with Alex:

Interview with Steve:

I'm actively looking for new guests for the podcast. You don't have to be a domain expert to be a good conversationalist! I'll be releasing the first episode in a new series called The Watercooler sometime this week. If you are charismatic and interested in chatting with me, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Edit: I just realized there's a bit of a mixing error towards the beginning. My monitoring was turned off for automation so I totally missed it. I'm fixing this and should be able to replace the audio without any issues. Wish me luck.

I decided to use typescript files from the official typesciprt repository for testing, and I found many bugs.
