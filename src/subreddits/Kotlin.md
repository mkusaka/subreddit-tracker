I suspect that I am using the wrong code design for my app. I am making a note taking app where each note is an object. In the main activity I create an empty `Notebook` object. In the `Notebook` is an empty mutableListOf of `Notes`s. Each `Note` has the context of the note. (text, date created, date updated ...). When the user clicks on the "Add a note" button it jumps to the CreateNote activity. 

I can think of two ways of adding that note. Either, 
 1. Serialize the `Notebook` object
 2. Send the `Notebook` by using 
```
// In main activity
intent.putExtra(NOTEBOOK, notebook)
// In CreateNote activity
val notebook = intent.getSerializableExtra(NOTEBOOK) as? Notebook
```
 3. Add a newly created note to the notebook
 4. Send back the updated notebook
 5. Update the notebook in main activity.

Alternatively, I can create a new `Note`, serialize it, and send it back. 


Is that the best coding style? If there was a way of storing the `Notebook` object as a shared object between activities I think that would be the best. I could then simply access that object (and potentially send an index if I want to edit a specific note). Is there a way to do that?

My mind was blown after seeing the [kotlin-power-assert](https://github.com/bnorm/kotlin-power-assert), and I'm eager to know about this (IR).

The [sources](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/compiler/ir) are so wide (even though well documented almost one third of those), its hard to follow a path i.e. where to see and understand the things.

I was trying to find a way to write a compiler plugin which can modify the intermediate code, so that it will easily target multiplatform, but not able to find any quick-start or something for where to start or start looking at the sources.

If anybody know already about this, he/she can share his experience and help for how to get started (basically I want to know how to traverse all the function/classes and then some way to find linked/called functions, etc).

Plan from a theoretical point of view and implement in Java the solution to the following problem:

We want to know how many different ways exist to obtain certain integer number as a sum of smaller positive numbers, taking into account a certain list of numbers that cannot be used.

Considerations

‚Ä¢ If A + B = B + A, only one of them should be indicated

‚Ä¢ In addition, A &gt; 0 and B &gt; 0

Input

Each case is described in one line with an integer number X, which is the value to obtain, and a list of M positive numbers N0, N1 ... NM-1 separated by a space. These values cannot be used as operands.

Output

For each case T, the output must be the string "#t:" followed by the total number of possible ways. For example

Sample input

3 1

6 1 3

Sample output

\#1: 0

\#2: 2

In the first case (3), there is no way to get 3 from 1 and 2 without using operand 1. The second case (6) can be calculated with operations 2 + 2 + 2 and 4 + 2, so there are 2 possible ways without using operands 1 and 3.

The objective is to create the most efficient algorithm able to perform this calculation

Any tips )

 Hello! I am currently working on acheiving certain tasks depending on the data received from a Bluetooth module using the input buffer. Currently I am trying to play a sound depending on the input using MediaPlayer.Create, but only seems to work when I have the device plugged in and hit "Apply Changes and Restart Activity." It does not seem to work if I were to just open the app and test, only after going through the process stated before. Is there a better way of reading the inputstream and handling that data? Is there also a better way to go about how I am playing a sound in the run() function of the ConnectedThread thread? This is my current code. I am also thinking of switching from MediaPlayer to SoundPool because I would like to play multiple sounds simultaneously, would that also be a good option?

                   var connectedthread= ConnectedThread(m_bluetoothSocket, context)
                   connectedthread.start()
                   Log.i("data", "connected")

           }
     
       }
    }

 I feel like the problem I have might be the way I am passing the context to the MediaPlayer in the ConnectedThread thread, but I'm honestly not too sure because i just started learning kotlin. What other options do I have for evaluating the bytearray being sent from the Bluetooth?

Hi guys, I'm an absolute beginner Android dev, with an end goal to develop a custom app for my DJI drone. I know very little Java &amp; none of Kotlin. The [DJI SDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Android) is written in Java.

With my end goal in mind, will it be possible to make a custom app for my drone in Kotlin? Or do I need to stick to Java since the DJI SDK itself is in Java?

Basis the answer to the above question I intend to start learning Android Studio tutorials either specifically for Java or Kotlin. Any guidance would be appreciated, thank you!

EDIT - THANKS A LOT guys, appreciate all the answers, look forward to coding in Kotlin!
