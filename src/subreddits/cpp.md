Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

## [3][Evaluating user defined logical expressions - booleval, small C++17 library](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnhmcr/evaluating_user_defined_logical_expressions/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnhmcr/evaluating_user_defined_logical_expressions/

Hi there,

For quite some time now, I have been implementing a small C++17 library [booleval](https://github.com/m-peko/booleval).

**How** ***booleval*** **library helps you?**

*booleval* library enables you to define logical expressions like *field\_a foo and field\_b 123*. Once you defined this expression, expression tree is being built by using recursive descent parser. Once the tree is built, you can pass a map of fields representing your object like:

    {
        "field_a": "foo",
        "field_b": 123
    }

This will evaluate to *true* since the condition from the logical expression is satisfied.

On the contrary, map of fields like:

    {
        "field_a": "bar",
        "field_b": 123
    }

will be evaluated to *false* since the AND logical operator is not satisfied.

**What is the use case?**

Let's say you have large number of packets coming through the network interface and you want to filter them out by the following logical expression *port 55* *or port 32*. Packets with port 55 or port 32 will pass the filter, and maybe those will be written out to the file. Other packets will be ignored.

**Supported data types:**

* string
* integer
* float
* double
* ...

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what you think about this library:

* are there any other libraries that I can include in my future benchmark?
* is there something to do to improve performance of evaluation?
* any feedback, suggestion is welcome :)
* don't forget to give it a star on Github ;)

Thanks in advance!!!

## [6][If you like std::span you'd like a new poly_span](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fn937i/if_you_like_stdspan_youd_like_a_new_poly_span/)

I like span and use it in my code (so far from abseil). I really miss derived to base class conversion feature which is provided by any pointer. I'd love to have functions specifying an interface, but taking containers of implementation classes directly, kind of Java-like type erasure.

    int countHungryAnimals(span::poly_span&lt;const Animal&gt; animals);
    std::vector&lt;Dog&gt; dogs = getDogs();
    std::array&lt;Cat, 5&gt; cats = getCats();
    const int hungryAnimanls = countHungryAnimals(dogs) + countHungryAnimals(cats);

Please welcome a new light-weight view poly\_span. Poly is for polymorphism. The interface is almost the same as for std::span. There is no dynamic allocation involved, just pointer arithmetic. Header-only lib, C++11 and newer.

Please check it out on [github](https://github.com/mrshurik/poly_span) and let me know what do you think.
## [7][Template literals to interpolate variables and expressions into strings](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnix8h/template_literals_to_interpolate_variables_and/)

lately working heavily on web and databases with typescript/javascript, there we have template literals which make working with sql and json much easier. On CPP side I work with nlohmann::json which works great though creating a json string does not look natural :D

same goes for SQL...

what would be needed to do to C++ to allow this behavior?

example:

    #include "mylib/myjson.hpp" // namespace mylib::json
    #include "mylib/mysql.hpp"  // namespace mylib::sql
    #include &lt;format&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;sstream&gt;
    
    int main() {
    
        // SQL
        const std::string table = static_cast&lt;int&gt;(rand()%2) ? "manager" : "engineer";
        const uint32_t salary =200'000u;
        // mylib::sql should take care of serializing and do typechecking
        mylib::sql sql_query(`
                SELECT * FROM ${table}
                WHERE salary &lt;=${salary}
            `);
    
        // JSON
        struct User {
            std::string username;
            uint8_t age;
        };
    
        User user{.username= "hans",.age= 99};
        // mylib::json should take care of serializing this to std::string
        mylib::json json_object(`
            {
                username: ${user.username},
                age: ${user.age}
            }
        `);
    
        // mylib::json should take care of serializing this to std::string and do typechecking
        const std::string serialized_json1 = `
        {
            username: ${user.username},
            age: ${user.age}
        }`_mylib_json;
    
        // today with fmt
        const std::string sereliazed_json2 = std::format(R"({{
            username: {},
            age: {}
        }})",user.username,user.age  ); 
    
        // today with iostream
        std::stringstream ss;
        ss &lt;&lt;
            "{" &lt;&lt;
                "username : " &lt;&lt; user.name &lt;&lt; ","&lt;&lt;
                "age: " &lt;&lt; user.age &lt;&lt; 
            "}";
    
        return 0;
    }

yomm2 is a library that implements open (multi-) methods for C++17. The library is fast (dispatching a 1-method takes only \~30% more time than the equivalent virtual function call) and non-intrusive. It is available here:  [https://github.com/jll63/yomm2](https://github.com/jll63/yomm2) I presented it at CppCon 2018, you can view the recording here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkxo0lah51s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkxo0lah51s) 

In addition to minor fixes and improvements, the major feature of this release is support for friend and inline methods.
