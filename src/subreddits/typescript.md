[https://github.com/deepkit/deepkit](https://github.com/deepkit/deepkit)

Product page: [https://deepkit.ai/](https://deepkit.ai/)

It's a machine learning platform for experiment tracking, execution, and debugging. The GUI is a real-time interface with native-like desktop interface which means all data is streamed using reactive RPC APIs via websockets. There's no REST or polling involved.

Additional new TS open-source byproducts that were created specifically for this product and might be of interest to you:

* [Marshal.ts](https://github.com/marcj/marshal.ts) \- The fastest universal Typescript data serializer and validator incl. Mongo-ORM abstraction
* [Glut.ts](https://github.com/marcj/glut.ts) \- A reactive real-time client-server framework with distributed entity/file abstraction, distributed data exchange, and automatic entity syncing, based on RxJs and websockets
* [angular-desktop-ui](https://github.com/marcj/angular-desktop-ui) \- A GUI library for native-like GUI widget based on Angular 9+
* [npm-local-development](https://github.com/marcj/npm-local-development) A \`npm link\` alternative that actually works with complex setups.
* [typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages](https://github.com/marcj/typedoc-plugin-lerna-packages) \- TS auto doc generator for lerna packages

Some notes:

* Package management with Lerna
* oclif for cli (with custom build), Angular 9+ for GUI, Electron 8+, custom client-server framework using Glut.ts, Mongo DB
* Development time roughly 1 year (80h/week, total EUR \~450k), a single developer (for the main product + those OSS libs)
* multi component build based on classic Makefile and webpack

I post it here to give people the opportunity to look how such a complex product is organised, that it is possible to write something like that in TS as a solo developer, and to ask questions about the development process and the like.
## [3][Conditional types change behaviour if under type alias](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/g14n1c/conditional_types_change_behaviour_if_under_type/)

I recently wanted to make sure that an array of strings contained all the strings of a string union.

I found a simple way, but when attempting to generalize the pattern, I came across some behaviour I cannot explain. Perhaps someone has an idea? (disclaimer: I may be missing something obvious)

&amp;#x200B;

    type UnionEquality&lt;A, B&gt; = A extends B ? (B extends A ? true : never) : never;
    type Foo = UnionEquality&lt;"foo" | "bar", "foo"&gt;; // true
    type Foo2 = "foo" extends "foo" | "bar" ? ("foo" | "bar" extends "foo" ? true : never) : never; // never

I'd expect \`Foo\` and \`Foo2\` to evaluate to the same type (`never`), since one is just an expansion of the other.
## [4][Type-hinted object initializer in parent constructor?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/g13okd/typehinted_object_initializer_in_parent/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/g13okd/typehinted_object_initializer_in_parent/
---
Is it possible to have a type-hinted object initializer inside a constructor on a parent class? Ex:
```
class Model {
    modelField: string;
    constructor(initializer: SomeSpecialType){
        Object.assign(this, initializer);
    }
}

class User extends Model{
    email: string;
}

const user = new User({
    email: '...' // only get type hints for the email property
})
```

I know it is possible using a static method:

```
class Model{
    someField: string;
    static new&lt;T extends Model&gt;(this: new() =&gt; T, data: Omit&lt;T, keyof Model&gt;) {
        return Object.assign(new this, data);
    }
}

const user = User.new({
    email: 'some email'
})
```

I tried to use the same parameters inside the constructor but TS is telling me that the `this` keyword cannot be used in a `constructor` not generics can be used there.

does all my logic, classes, async/await code stay and work the same? Im just concerned that some of the stuff I wrote in javascript may not work in ts.

I (or rather, a library I'm using) have a lot of interfaces for various options where a lot is optional.

```
interface Options {
  a?: number;
  b?: number;
  c?: number;
}
```

I create objects of the options I'm going to use, but also need to refer to these myself. I want the type checking when making the object, but after that I don't want things I've not specified to be available, or things I _have_ specified to be possibly undefined, like here:

```
const o: Options = { a: 1 } // Good: Object is type checked
o.a.toFixed(0)              // Bad: `a` is possibly undefined
```

Could just skip the type, but then there's no type checking of the options:

```
const o = { a: 1, d: 2 } // Bad: `d` isn't an option
o.a.toFixed(0)           // Good: `a` is defined
```

So, I created a helper function:

```
const createOptions = &lt;O extends Options&gt;(options: O): O =&gt; options
const o = createOptions({ a: 1 }) // Good: Object is type checked
o.a.toFixed(0)                    // Good: `a` is defined
```

This works, but having to create a function like this for every option type is getting annoying and messy. Is it possible to create a single generic helper function for this?

---

My first newb attempt was the following, but here Typescript requires me to supply _2_ types, rather than just the _1_ (`Options`) that should be necessary.

```
const create = &lt;T, U extends T&gt;(obj: U): U =&gt; obj
const o = create&lt;Options&gt;({ a: 1 }) // Bad: Typescript wants me to specify U
```

How can I write this identity function so I only need to specify `T`, and have Typescript infer `U` itself from the object I pass in?

I could do 
```
const test = &lt;ILalamove&gt;partners[claimedPartner];
const riderInfos = await test.GetDriver(claimedJob.id,
                                        claimedJob.riderId,
                                        job.isTest,
                                    );
```
But not
```
const riderInfos = await &lt;ILalamove&gt;partners[claimedPartner].GetDriver(claimedJob.id,
                                        claimedJob.riderId,
                                        job.isTest,
                                    );
```
nor
```
const riderInfos = await partners[claimedPartner] as &lt;ILalamove&gt; 
                  .GetDriver(claimedJob.id,claimedJob.riderId,job.isTest,);
```
Do we have better way to do this casting?

Thanks

Trying to get more comfortable with TS, but this "I know this works - why isn't this working" is killing me! Any insight is appreciated...

I need to process data from one nested JSON object into another form of nested objects, but when I am using a `for...in` w/a nested `for...in` to cycle through objects/properties the ts-compiler says that a string can't be used to index my json object even though the keys are all strings? 

Given a keys array and a json data obj{} I import

    const keysArr = ['A','B','C'];
    const jsonData = {
      A: { A: '0', B: '0', C: '1' },
      B: { A: '1', B: '0', C: '-1' },
      C: { A: '-1', B: '1', C: '-1' },
    };

I'm trying to cycle through the key/vals of each "JsonLetter" to evaluate and create a dictionary-object:

    dictionary = {   // &lt;~~Desired outcome
        A: { isPos: ['B'], isNeg: ['C'] },
        B: { isPos: ['C'], isNeg: [] },
        C: { isPos: ['A'], isNeg: ['B', 'C'] },
    };

But I can NOT get the process to work: 
First looping through the properties of `jsonData` to get each JsonLetterObj. Then looping through the properties of each JsonLetterObj to process the values while still referring to the key that got me there...

In *non*-TS code, I want to do is the following - 

    for (let key in jsonData) {
      const letterObj = jsonData[key];  // &lt;~~ where I have my implicit `any` ERROR
      for (let subKey in letterObj) {
        const val = parseInt( letterObj[subKey] );
        if (val &gt; 0) {  dictionary[subKey].isPos.push(key); }
        if (val &lt; 0) {  dictionary[subKey].isNeg.push(key); }
      }
    }
    
I *think* I need these defined, but I'm not sure how\where to use them

    interface JsonLetterObj { [key: string]: string; }        
    interface JsonData { [key: string]: JsonLetterObj; } 


On the upside, I did manage to create the empty `dictionary` obj{} above by defining an interface and reducing through my keys array (though I'm not sure if this is "right"?)...
    
    interface Dictionary {
      [key: string]: {
        isPos: string[];
        isNeg: string[];
      };
    }
    function makeDictionary(keysArr: string[]): Dictionary {
      return keysArr.reduce((obj: Dictionary, key): Dictionary =&gt; {
        obj[key] = { isPos: [], isNeg: [] };
        return obj;
      }, {});
    }
    let dictionary = makeDictionary(keysArr);

However, I don't understand my error with the looping process. 

Should I just not be using for-in loops and instead reduce twice through my keys array? That is doable but would seem too brittle/"declarative" to me.

Any help would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance!
## [10][Typescript class extends implements?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/g0lik3/typescript_class_extends_implements/)

I have a base class
```
export class Partner {
    constructor() {}

    /* Return success - { id, status, deliveryFee, trackingId, trackingUrl, startAt, expireAt }
              failed  - { error }
    */
    CreateJob(data: any, options: LogisticOptions) {}

    /* Return success - { id, status, deliveryFee, trackingId, trackingUrl, startAt, expireAt }
              failed  - { error }
    */
    GetJob(id: string, options: LogisticOptions) {}

    /* Return success - { status: string }
              failed  - { error }
    */
    GetStatus(id: string, options: LogisticOptions) {}

    /* Return success - { success: boolean }
              failed  - { error }
    */
    CancelJob(id: string, options: LogisticOptions) {}
}
```

And a class and an interface

```
class Lalamove extends Partner implements ILalamove {
   
    ...base class

    GetDriver() {}

}

interface ILalamove {
    GetDriver(id: string, riderId: string, options: LogisticOptions): DriverDetailResponse;
}
```

I want to ILalamove to define the additional functions that the base class doesn't have.Is it the intended way to use "implement interface" on class?
Otherwise, could you give me an example on how to use the implement &amp; extends for classes?

Thanks for the help~

So I've given most of my Express middleware this type: [https://pastebin.com/kCnjfUex](https://pastebin.com/kCnjfUex)

But now, after updating all of my NPM packages to the latest I have 100+ errors all saying something like this:`TS2322: Type 'RequestHandler&lt;ParamsDictionary, any, any, any&gt;' is not assignable to type 'Middleware'. Â Â Type 'RequestHandler&lt;ParamsDictionary, any, any, any&gt;' provides no match for the signature '(req: RequestExtended, res: Response&lt;any&gt;, next: NextFunction): void | Promise&lt;Response&lt;any&gt;&gt;'`

Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?  


EDIT: Fixed, I deleted node\_modules and package.lock.json and then used command `npm i`  
@ Types/express needed to be at version 4.17.0, and so changed that in package.json
