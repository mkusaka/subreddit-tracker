I'm currently hosting the website using Firebase. I plan to change the portfolio in the next version. Any ideas are welcome.

Almost all the things I've used is mentioned in the github Readme.

I just did that and it seems to be very similar to webpack 4.  Bundle size decreased by 0.5%, build time remains similar.  Besides module federation which I don't use, and opt-in persistent caching that seem to bebetter left off, what's the biggest feature I can tell my boss/coworker? I went through the changelog and couldn't fully appreciate the technical changes that are being made.

If you are planning to migrate, be prepared to deal with a bunch of config migrations, adding node polyfills, getting a lot more webpack api warnings and dealing with some incompatible webpack plugins :)

I'm new to React and maybe to Web development,
But I'm struggling to make a beautiful website or maybe just a landing page.
Which is the best way to do that ?
Material- Ui ?

I am currently developing a weather app, when the page loads the CSS is different from when you have searched a location, it appears on the top left. Here is a gif showing this.. 

also, can anyone tell me why the image jumps when first searched but is transitioning smoothly after a couple of searches?

My code:

**CSS**

    html, body, #root {
    font: 0.9rem sans-serif;
    background: #0a1f44;
    color: #1e2432;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    width: auto;
    }

    .app.cold {
    background-image: url('./images/cold.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    transition: 0.3s ease-in;
    }

    .app.warm{
    background-image: url('./images/warm.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;

    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    transition: 0.3s ease-in;
    }


    .search {
    outline: none;
    padding: 20px 7%;
    border-radius: 20px;
    border: none;
    margin-bottom: 5%;
    background: rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.85);
    }

    .city {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    padding: 40px 8%;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.85);
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.404);
    }


**APP.JS**

     let day = days[d.getDay()];
     let date = d.getDate();
