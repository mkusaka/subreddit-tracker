**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

## [4][Preview of my second library, ESeed Window, window management library currently supporting Win32 and Vulkan, more to come](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3iae9/preview_of_my_second_library_eseed_window_window/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g3iae9/preview_of_my_second_library_eseed_window_window/

Good day reddit folks! I hope everyone is safe! Not too long ago I posted my first library [ESeed Math](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fpum4g/eseed_math_my_first_c_library/)  on r/cpp, which got a greater response than I expected for such a small project! I was quite happy.

In any case, my second library [ESeed Window (GitHub)](https://github.com/elijaharita/eseed-window) has been in the works since then, and is finally in a functioning state! It's a C++ window management library designed for uniform cross-platform use with a variety of rendering APIs. The first supported API is Vulkan, as the platform-specific code is pretty simple. Thanks Vulkan! =) The first platform is Win32.

Why did I make a window library when we have GLFW and SDL? And SFML? And Qt? You know, that's a good question. I only have 1 and a half brain cells and I make myself do everything from scratch! In any case, although each of these libraries will accomplish the job they're designed for, I'm not quite happy with any of them. GLFW's Vulkan support is a lil hacky, and GLFW and SDL are both written in C, which does awkwardly stand out in C++ code. On the other side of the spectrum, SFML and Qt are much larger libraries. I just wanted a simple light weight C++ window library. If there is a library out there that's like what I'm looking for, that I just happened not to find... well, haha. hahahaha :')))))

A small list of supported features --

* Platform-agnostic window construction
* No nasty windows.h in the library's header files! yay!
* Title management
* Keyboard and mouse input (getters and callbacks)
* Cursor control
* Position and size management
* Fullscreen
* Unicode support
* Platform-agnostic Vulkan surface creation
* Event polling and waiting

Here is a code example to run a minimal window --

    #include &lt;eseed/window/window.hpp&gt;
    
    int main() {
        esd::wnd::Window window("Window!", { 1366, 768 });
        while (!window.isCloseRequested()) {
            window.waitEvents();
        }
    }

Creating a Vulkan surface is also very simple!

    #include &lt;vulkan/vulkan.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;eseed/window/vulkanwindow.hpp&gt;
    
    int main() {
        esd::wnd::VulkanWindow window("Vulkan Window!" { 1366, 768 });
        
        // Get required instance extensions for surface creation
        std::vector&lt;const char*&gt; extensions = 
            window.getRequiredSurfaceInstanceExtensions();
        
        vk::InstanceCreateInfo instanceCreateInfo;
        ...
        instanceCreateInfo.setEnabledExtensionCount((uint32_t)extensions.size());
        instanceCreateInfo.setPpEnabledExtensions(extensions.data());
        ...
        vk::Instance instance = vk::createInstance(instanceCreateInfo);
    
        // C VkSurfaceKHR is also supported, if you're into that kinda stuff : )
        vk::SurfaceKHR surface = window.createSurface(instance);
    
        ...
    
        while (!window.isCloseRequested()) {
    
            ...
          
            window.poll();
        }
    
        ...
    }

So, this is just a preview release. While I see no reason that it couldn't used in production code, it will currently only run on Windows. However, I'd like to change that! Adding additional platforms like MacOS and Wayland is going to be a lot of work for me, and I'm willing to do it. However, if anybody else finds this concept interesting, and would like to collaborate on adding additional platforms, let me know! If this library can make it to a more developed state, I'm sure there'll be plenty of people to benefit from it.

I am 17. I don't have much experience with writing open source libraries. I've done my best to create a useful piece of technology, but of course, for a large project such as this, assistance is very much appreciated &lt;3 Whatever the result, I'm proud of starting to be able to stay focused on a project without giving up. Everyone, thanks for reading, and enjoy your day!

At a class in college the professor said that the mentioned usage should work (and by work I mean it should have no effect, noop). But often to support that I needed to wrap the usual logic in an if that checks if they have the same address, which seems wasteful to me. What are some of the non-trivial pitfalls if I choose to not support `x = move(x)`? Does anything in the STL depend on it?
