Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

Hi all,

This month the C++ London meetup are joining up with the Rust London meet-up and we have some talks lined on introducing Rust to C++ developers, include some comparing and contrasting. Rust has become a particular interest of many C++ developers (and many Rust developers are curious about C++ too). We aim to do a few of these - and while we're meeting online, this is, of course, open to everyone!

For more details, and to register, here's the meet-up link:

[https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/273113055/](https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/273113055/)

Note we'll be using Remo to host the meet-ups - the same platform that hosted C++ on Sea, and will host CppCon next week (and a few other upcoming conferences).

If you have any proposals for future events in this series, we'd be very interested to hear from you, too.

After about 6 years of professional C++ development, including top tech companies (think FAANG), I decided to move to finance. Since 2017, I've been working for one of the top-tier investment banks, developing trading systems in Java. While I'm totally enjoying working in this field, I'm not particularly happy about writing in Java and am missing C++ a lot.

Unfortunately, my bank has nearly zero C++ openings, and even those are legacy projects. I am thinking to switch back to C++ by getting a job at another bank/prop trading/hedge fund.

My main question - what is the best way to brush up my C++ after a few years of Java? I certainly haven't forgotten the basics, always use C++ for my Leetcode practice, but apparently that couldn't replace real work experience. Should I try and start a C++ pet project as a preparation / read Effective C++ / ... something else?

Also, the last standard that I used in my work was C++11 (with a bit of '14). I have almost no experience with '17. What's the best way to  learn it, provided I'm not a complete noob?

Thank you.

Hi all, 

I am trying to find a reference sheet that displays the time complexity of EVERY STL container. Ideally for operations such as insert, delete find, sort etc.

The ones I found by googling are pretty incomplete and not very useful for my purposes.

If someone could point me in the right direction it would be appreciated.
