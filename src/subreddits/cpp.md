**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

**Or how I was so bored with Java that I switched from software to mechanical engineering, became a web developer, and finally started to love C++!**

So my programming related story: before joining university, I thought I wanted to become a software engineering, I think I wanted to make games at that point. Then, after taking a year of general engineering courses, calculus, physics, intro programming (in Pascal :D), I had my first semester at computer science department. The object oriented programming course was in Java. I hated it so much that I dropped all of my courses, switched field to mechanical engineering, and for almost ten years didn't touch any programs that wasn't directly related to my mechanical engineering jobs (I did assembly and embedded C for micro-controllers and  matlab and labview). I was so happy with my decision to do mechanical engineering, it felt so real!

Fast forward to about three years ago, that I had this startup idea of mine \[is it a phase that we all go through?\] and it needed me to develop an app for it. I'm one of those people who likes to gets hands on and do everything himself \[I suppose that's a euphemism for being a lone wolf who doesn't know how to lead/persuade people to follow him\] and I started learning web development, which is obviously mostly in JavaScript.

To my surprise, the focus on functional programming in the JavaScript community, at least the niche I was dwelling in - I was learning React/redux which is big on functional and immutably, made it much more relatable to me than Java. It felt more like math; no more weird analogy between classes and the world and stuff. Then a friend of my introduced me to [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and for the first time I was having fun reading an academic book on software... Yet JavaScript had started to wear me down as well and started toying with the idea of leaving my programming career unfinished. I took algorithm courses, learned about complexity analysis, TLA and distributed systems, but still felt something was missing, there was a hole that I just couldn't pin point.

I had been told, since ages ago and till now, that C++ is a flawed language; that we use it just because we have to, because there's just so much legacy of it lying around. What I didn't know, what that I'm going to love it exactly because of  what I presume are the roots of it's flaws! I've been taking [a course in C++](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals) and it starts by discussing \* and &amp; and heap memory vs stack and how the memory allocation grows and such, and, what little did I know, this is exactly what I had been missing! The link between the never-feeling-real codes on my screen and the real physical world that runs these codes. To end on a dramatic note - I know if I had to deal with all the memory related issues in my actual job I might not have said this \[though probably I still would\], thanks for not dying out C++ and having yourself replaced with all the other languages that do away with the real stuff and replace it with garbage collection and more abstractions, I love seeing your garbages!

I'm reading some documents by the author of FontForge and he discusses why didn't choose C++ to write the application. He has the following criticisms:

* The semantics of a C++ program cannot be specified. The compiler is free to generate temporaries as it wishes. In C this is not a problem, but in C++ the creation of a temporary can involve calling a constructor and a destructor which may have untold side-effects. I find this frightening.
* The order of execution of external constructors is unspecified. I have seen many inexplicable bugs caused by this.
* I find it extremely difficult to debug C++. Stepping through a statement often involves many unexpected procedure calls (some of which are inlined and not obvious). This distracts from my main purpose in debugging.

Have recent standard versions of C++ addressed these issues? Are they real issues for others? They seem like ninja-level problems to me.

## [10][std::bitset and finding first set bit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hebcnu/stdbitset_and_finding_first_set_bit/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hebcnu/stdbitset_and_finding_first_set_bit/
---
I want to implement an allocator for small sizes using a bitmask.  I have seen that there are fast intrinsics for finding the first set or unset bit and returning the index.  Stackoverflow has some super interesting discussions on the subject i.e. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/757059/position-of-least-significant-bit-that-is-set](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/757059/position-of-least-significant-bit-that-is-set)

I would much rather use std::bitset than roll my own solution and was suprised to see that bitset does NOT have any special ability to find the first set or unset index with or without using intrinsics.

There is a whole wiki page devoted to the "Find First Set" instructions on different platforms: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find\_first\_set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set)

So I was wondering at what point do people just stick within the C++ standard or actually get there hands dirty with intrinsics.  When should we expect the standard to already be doing the job where clearly in a simple case like this it is not doing it?

## [12][Conan best practices ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hedgw3/conan_best_practices/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hedgw3/conan_best_practices/
---
I'm currently making a few small libraries that I want to distribute easily (teaching scenario), and Conan seems a good option for that. 

My only concern is that I can't really find any documentation or blog post or anything about what the best practices are for packaging C++ libraries with Conan.

In particular, here are the main questions I have:

1. In source or out of source recipes?
2. Which CMake generator to use?
3. Is it ok to impose Conan on my users or should I leave them a choice?
4. How to deal properly with GCC 5.2 ABI break? My solution so far is to modify the default profile to force the new ABI so that I don't end up with linking issues but I don't like very much.

Do you have any resource available on these subjects? If not but you are a Conan user, what's your opinion on that and am I missing some important points?
