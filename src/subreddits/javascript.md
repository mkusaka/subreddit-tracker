**1)** React, Angular or Vue ? Which you prefer and why ? 


**2)** Do you love or hate Typescript ? Do you feel it's necessary for each project ? I mean is JS becoming more OO to you or more Functional... would you hate to see JS becoming slowly C# or Java ? 


**3)** Is Jquery dead ? Is it still possible/better to develop a large project in native JS without a framework ? or gain performance / programmer time for a senior dev etc ?

Hello. I’m currently trying to figure out how I can increase the random cycle time length. It changes around 8 seconds, but I want it to cycle every 20 minutes if possible. I’m currently looking through the palette cycle script am in having trouble reading through it, and I was wondering if someone can help. 

Here is the website: https://www.gjtorikian.com/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/

And here is the script: https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/blob/gh-pages/src/rom/palette_cycle.js

Hello. When you click on the endless random button in this site, it goes through the combinations. My only issue is that it changes way too fast. I was wondering if there was i way I could inspect the element and change the time change to say a minute or longer?

You see, eg. Vue itself is a framework of JavaScript, and there are another frameworks of Vue, (eg. Nuxt, Quasar, Framework7, etc).

So eventually it becomes, the framework of a framework. I thinks it's the right time to implement a new word for these (Nuxt, Quasar, etc) in our developers dictionary. 

What you say? What should it be? Or am I wrong about this, correct me if I am. Let's have a discussion over it!
