We’re the Android engineering team, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on [r/androiddev](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/) next week, on **July 9th**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), where next week we’re diving deep into Android 11 Compatibility, with a look at some of the new tools and milestones. As part of the week, we’re hosting an AMA on the recent updates we’ve made to the platform in Android 11.

This is your chance to ask us *technical* questions related to Android 11 features and changes. Please note that we want to keep the conversation focused strictly on the engineering of the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, July 9 at 12:00 PM PST / 3:00 PM EST (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PST / 4:20 PM EST. **Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time**. This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

I took inspiration from [r/ITCareerQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/) and I want to hear on the Android Developers specifically so I want to hear the harsh truths that newcomers should know before choosing to be a Android Developer?

Also, do you have to be good at Math? Or a College Degree would help or required?
