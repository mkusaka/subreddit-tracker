We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

So I'm making a project for a company of an relative, and I can't wrap my head around this problem.

The project will consist of a static single page with a contact form that registers clients on the backend and a dashboard to view and manage thoose clients.

My question is **Is it fine to have two different React apps on the same express server ?** At the moment I'm using React Router but I feel like having the main website has a static website (also to have meta tags to be easier to appear on google search) and a seperate react app for a dashboard is way cleaner and easier to work with.

I would think this wouldn't take much unnecessary space if I use something like Monorepo since it would also help making a React Native app down the line.

What are your thoughts and any ideas on making the Dashboard and authentication for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a full-stack clone of orkut, which was a very popular social media in the late 2000's and early 2010's in Brazil and India. The goal was to have projects for my portfolio since I'm a beginner web dev.

  
I added a few of the features that existed back then, like photo uploading, community creation, very basic feed, friend suggestions, scraps, testimonials etc. And sorry it's not in English. Maybe I'll add internationalization in the future.  


Some technologies I used:

ReactJS, Styled Components, GraphQL,  Apollo, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Sequelize ORM

Hey!

I'm making an app where you can login with Spotify. Currently when you click Sign In, it takes you to '/login' page and I send a request to my Node server and I do all of the OAuth process from backend. 

That works alright, but what I want to do is open a popup, sign in and then close it but on the main window, the page won't change but It'll just refresh. 

How do I check if it succeeded on the main window of my app? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is not really clear but I hope someone gets what I mean...

I've created a chat widget using create react app and would like to embed it on websites.
However, I haven't been able to make it embedable. Any simple solutions which output one JS file and embedding it should work? I tried googling but the solution I got didn't work anymore.
