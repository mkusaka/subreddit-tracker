Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/glvkc5/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

## [5][iterators filter().count() vs fold() in 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gs2jvj/iterators_filtercount_vs_fold_in_2020/)

I came across this issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33038 which mentioned that in 2016, filter().count() was slower than fold() for the same functionality. That issue is closed but it links to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55559 which remains an open issue.

Can I ask is this still a concern in 2020, or has it been resolved? I did some benchmarks of filter().count() vs fold() and there didn't seem to be much difference.

I've written a simple Hangman command line game. Would be open to any suggestions on how to improve my code! Repo is [here](https://github.com/ptrbrynt/hangman)

I'm coming from mobile development so Rust has introduced a fair few new concepts for me. Really enjoying it though!
