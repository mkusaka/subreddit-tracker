I can't describe how horrible this experience was.  I am not looking forward to how much work I am going to have to do to get my money back.  This is not my first AWS certification (I have SA Pro and DevOps Pro), but is my first online exam.  The short version is: Don't take AWS exams via the Pearson Vue at home option, even if it is offered.  AWS should not be offering this option as I can attest it is a waste of time.  Ironically, AWS would have us use their services because of their high availability and scaling but apparently they don't ask their test partners to do the same!

It started off easy enough: I passed the initial 'checks' as it confirmed my internet speed, camera access, and microphone access.  I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.  I tried again, and then a third time.  Same experience.  As I write this, I left it on that page and the spinning is continuing.  This screen has been spinning for no less than 45 minutes.  At 8 minutes before my scheduled exam, I tried finding the help link.  A chat window opened, and I waited, and waited, and waited.  Still waiting as I write this.  My chat window has been open for 52 minutes and still no one to help.  Every two minutes I get ' All agents are currently assisting others. Thank you for your patience.' written in the window.  OK - what next?  They make it harder to find, but I got a phone number I can call.  I tried calling that.  Busy signal.  For the next 20 minutes I called back and back, busy signal.  Finally, I got it to actually pick up, but of course no human yet.  No estimate of time to when I can be helped.  They don't even have nice elevator music to listen to.  Who knows when I will be able to talk to someone.  This has been an exceedingly poor experience.

If you value your time, please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt a online exam with Pearson.  I worked hard to prepare for this exam and rescheduled things to fit around it.  Now, I will have to do that all again.

u/jeffbarr Is this the experience AWS is hoping to get with their testing partners?  This was a waste of my time and money.  Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.

*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.

For what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.

*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.  I am actually quite surprised.

[Amazon's AWS establishes new aerospace cloud unit as Jeff Bezos increases bets on outer space](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/amazons-aws-establishes-aerospace-and-satellite-solutions-space-unit.html)

By Michael Sheetz

* Amazon Web Services announced on Tuesday it was establishing a new space unit called Aerospace and Satellite Solutions.

* Job listings for the AWS unit identify it's looking to provide services for nearly every space sub-sector, including rocket launches, human spaceflight support, robotic systems, mission control operations, space stations, satellite networks and more.

* Amazon has steadily grown its influence in the space industry in recent years, with a satellite connection service called AWS Ground Station and a satellite internet venture called Project Kuiper.

The company announced on Tuesday that AWS is establishing a new unit called Aerospace and Satellite Solutions, led by former U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Clint Crosier — who most recently directed the establishment of the U.S. Space Force.

"We find ourselves in the most exciting time in space since the Apollo missions," Crosier said in a statement.

My problem still exists, so do I click NO?

But *the support person* did their job well.

If the problem is with AWS itself, not the support person, what do I click?

AWS seems like the kind of company that would ruthlessly enforce KPIs for support people. I don't want someone to lose their job because they told me that AWS can't do X, so my problem can't be solved.

I have an auto-scaling group with two EC2 instances , each with a persistent EBS mounted. My application requires the data on EBS to be in sync, how do I achieve that ? 

I can think of introducing an s3 where both the EBS sync their data but wondering if there's a better solution.

PS - Can't use multi-attach functionality. Also, can only use EBS (not EFS)

Not sure if my understanding of DNS is correct, is there any way to create a CNAME record for a hosted zone. I have a zone called "subdomain.domain.com."  - for this I wanted to create a CNAME record. However it wants a subdomain at a second level for me to create it. It displays a box wanting me to put "something.subdomain.domain.com" - Is there any way to create a record that point "subdomain.domain.com" to "anotherdomain.com"?

Thanks in advance

We are moving over to a build process using Terraform/Serverless and someone decided to make all the Lambda functions which were previously traditional Lambda functions, Lambda proxy functions.

The event that arrives at the Lambda is completely different when API Gateway uses a Lambda proxy. Is there any good writeup on the differences? My app is broken AF right now :( I don't see much in the way of configuring or parsing input from the frontend in API Gateway, and Serverless-Domain-Manager which is creating the API Gateway is 4 lines of magic code.

Is anyone knows how to add a proper URL using route53 to AWS Elastic search Kibana endpoint. I got this endpoint from my AWS elastic search

Hi, I've searched in some whitepapers (including the VPC user's guide) and I've not found a comparison of creating a private subnet that allows out traffic trough a NAT vs just only allowing inbound to the VPC IP CIDR and still using a Internet gateway and the instances having a public IP.

I'm new to the security and network stuff and it may be basic, but is there any advantage of using a NAT considering security?
## [11][how to make a local app assume an IAM role?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hj4vct/how_to_make_a_local_app_assume_an_iam_role/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hj4vct/how_to_make_a_local_app_assume_an_iam_role/
---
I have a locally running app that uses an AWS SDK to access resources on my AWS account. I would like the local app to assume an IAM role, just as a live EC2 instance would.

To find out how to do this, I read up on these two pages:

* [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html)
* [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#using-aws-iam-roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#using-aws-iam-roles)

So far, this is my understanding, written as steps required to achieve this:

1) create two IAM resources: `user1`, `role1`

2) locally, create a CLI profile config and credentials for `user1`

3) locally, create a CLI profile for `role1`, which looks like

```
[role1]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myapprole
source_profile = user1
```

4. create an IAM policy attached to `user1` that allows `user1` to assume `role1` 

5. set the local profile: `export AWS_PROFILE=role1` 

6. the current profile will now have permissions of the policies attached to `role1` 

7. run the app locally, and the AWS SDK will effectively have the permissions of `role1`

Can someone please advise whether my understanding is correct and explain anything I'm missing? Thank you!
