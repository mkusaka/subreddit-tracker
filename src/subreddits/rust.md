Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g4nu6/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Before we begin, job-seekers should also remember to peruse [the prior thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fjsj1l/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

This thread will be periodically stickied to the top of /r/rust for improved visibility. The thread will be refreshed and posted anew when the next version of Rust releases in six weeks.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting (adapted from /r/cpp's jobs thread).
# Rules for individuals:

Hi people!

I've decided to apply some of the concepts I've learned by studying TAPL and write an small functional PL. You can find its source code and more information [here](https://github.com/christianpoveda/pijama/)

I've received a lot of feedback from my blog series about writing an interpreter for the lambda calculus, so I hope you'll enjoy this project too.

Hey Rustaceans,

Announcing [Routerify](https://github.com/routerify/routerify): A lightweight and modern **router implementation with middleware** support for the HTTP library [hyper.rs](https://hyper.rs/).

The¬†[Routerify](https://github.com/routerify/routerify) offers the following features:

* üì°¬†Allows defining **complex routing logic**.
* üî®¬†Provides **middleware** support.
* üåÄ¬†Supports **Route Parameters**.
* üöÄ¬†**Fast** as¬†hyper.rs¬†and ready for **production** use.
* üç∫¬†It supports **any response body type** as long as it implements the¬†[HttpBody](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.5/hyper/body/trait.HttpBody.html)¬†trait.
* ‚ùó¬†Provides a flexible **error handling** strategy.
* üçó¬†Exhaustive¬†[examples](https://github.com/routerify/routerify/tree/master/examples)¬†and **well documented**.

From the latest release, just a few minutes ago, via issue [#347](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/pull/347):

&gt; Notice: failure is deprecated. If you liked failure's API, consider using:

&gt; - [Anyhow](https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow) is a good replacement for `failure::Error`.
&gt; - [thiserror](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) is a good, near drop-in replacement for `#[derive(Fail)]`.

While it didn't last, I think it was clearly an important step in Rust's error handling evolution.

&gt; Note: This a follow up of my [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gbk1ta/multiplexinginterleaving_2_streams_with_fallback) where I asked for advice.

I'm happy with the result:

* performances are decent: 2.02GiB/s for multiplexing 1.66GiB (= 2 streams) worth of data as 1KB chunks. (test made with `&gt; /dev/null`, no disk IO involved)
* it looks fairly idiomatic: iterate both streams as `chunks`, `zip_longuest` them together, `flat_map` the resulting iterator and write the result to stdout.

I'm still looking forward improving this tool =)

&gt; Note: I had a x2 speedup by wrapping stdout in `BufWriter`

Hello, I'm trying to convert a struct from a 3rd party crate (in my case Backtrace) to a string. Looks like it doesn't have the function implemented, so I'm getting this error:

    error[E0599]: no method named `to_string` found for struct `backtrace::capture::Backtrace` in the current scope
      --&gt; src/program.rs:79:34
       |
    79 |     println!("{}", Backtrace::new().to_string());
       |                                     ^^^^^^^^^ method not found in `backtrace::capture::Backtrace`
       |
       = note: the method `to_string` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
               `backtrace::capture::Backtrace : std::string::ToString`
    error: aborting due to previous error

I'm not exactly sure how to go about implementing the function, this doesn't seem to work:

    use backtrace::capture::Backtrace;
    
    impl ToString for Backtrace {
        fn to_string(&amp;self) {
            println!("aaaa");
        }
    }



    error[E0603]: module `capture` is private
       --&gt; src/program.rs:8:16
        |
    8   | use backtrace::capture::Backtrace;

        | impl doesn't use only types from inside the current crate
        |
        = note: define and implement a trait or new type instead

Any ideas how to do this right?
