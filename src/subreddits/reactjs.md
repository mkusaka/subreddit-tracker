We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

What are most important things in the official documentation that everyone should read? To be honest, I didn't read the official documentation at all, and chose instead to learn it by reading blogs and tinkering with other people's applications, so I am wondering if i missed out anything important.

Hi everyone.

I built a small contact list app based on the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and it's available [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-contact-list-usbbb). I was wondering if any of you good people would care to comment on the quality of the code and what you would do differently. It would be a great learning experience for me.

Thanks for your time.

Has anyone else had the experience of picking up advanced JS concepts more easily while learning React?

I still don't have as deep an understanding of JS as I'd like and have struggled for awhile with really getting comfortable working my way around the language and being able to create elegant solutions to problems, but I feel like I'm picking things up through learning React that I haven't been able to so far working with other lessons.

I guess it helps that React's documentation is pretty fantastic too!
