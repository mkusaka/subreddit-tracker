Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Hi, Eclipse 2020-03 with CDT 9.11 has been released. Recently a lot of changes to improve c++ support into Eclipse has been performed and a lot of other effort needs to be spent.  I'm curious to know what you think about it. Eclipse is quite popular but there are a lot of alternatives like Visual Studio, CLion, Netbeans and so on. What are you using and why?

Just some improvements so far:

1. A lot of new options for the built-in formatter: improvements for comment formatting, on/off tags
2. Improvements and bug fixes for the refactor: for example the automatic implementation to override methods in child classes
3. Improved the class wizard to create a new class with fresh new C++11 options and according to the rule of five
4. Improved doxygen support for automatic generation of tags
5. Added a lot of new options about compiler warnings
6. Added new C++17 features support, like structured bindings

Some areas where cdt community is currently working for short-term:

1. Integrate all C++17 features into the built-in parser, like CTAD and constexpr lambda expressions (with 9.12 I think 95% should be covered)
2. Improve the support for CMake projects
3. Other Improvements for the static analysis and built-in formatter support

For long-term:

1. There's nothing for C++20 yet, the idea could be to move everything to LSP, it could be a great change
2. Rework the built-in build system to have something more flexible
## [6][Application of C++ in ARM processors](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/flqdmy/application_of_c_in_arm_processors/)

Hello,

It has been two quarters (third one online due to COVID-19) and I have been studying C++ at my university. I have made several fundamental projects using C++ and want to dig deeper.

I want to build something with an ARM processor, but I don't know how should I go about it! I am willing to learn new things, and want to not only study, but use a programming language learned in the classroom.

Is there a specific learning path I should follow to explore ARM processors? How and what should I start learning? (I have just recently completed Data Structures in C++)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

I am hiring for my company. And the codes submitted for a test problem has '#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;' at the beginning. The MacOS default compiler complains

`main.cpp:1:9: fatal error: 'bits/stdc++.h' file not found`

`#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;`

`^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`

`1 error generated.` 

Why people are using '#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;'?

## [11][The poplar heap, an implicit data structure](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fko8f2/the_poplar_heap_an_implicit_data_structure/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fko8f2/the_poplar_heap_an_implicit_data_structure/
---
A few years ago while going through old computer science papers I stumbled upon *Smoothsort Revisited* by Coenraad Bron and Wim H. Hesselink which introduces a new sorting algorithm inspired by Dijkstra's smoothsort that they call *poplar sort*. The algorithm is based on the construction and sorting of a forest of "poplars", which is the name the authors give to some specific kinds of heap.

Back then I decided to implement this *poplar sort* algorithm in C++ for fun. Over the years I kept coming back to this simple algorithm, trying to find optimizations which led to a variety of experiments. Eventually I managed to turn the backing *poplar heap* into an implicit data structure and to implement functions for it matching the heap functions from the standard library's `&lt;algorithm&gt;` header. I turned those experiments into an "article" some time ago, so if you're interested into algorithms, data structures and C++ optimization, you can read it here: https://github.com/Morwenn/poplar-heap

Most of the space and time complexities mentioned in the repository are guesstimates waiting for proofs that I'm unlikely to provide myself.  That said the same heap data structure was also described by Nicholas J. A. Harvey and Kevin C. Zatloukal under the name *post-order heap* and their paper has complexity proofs for similar algorithms (theirs differs slightly from ours since it uses two additional variables to keep track of the state of the heap).

The article only describes my successful experiments. If you want to look further into the research area, I've also a Gist with another experiment where I used a secondary heap (a normal binary heap this time) to try to reduce the amount of comparison performed by the `sort_heap` algorithm: https://gist.github.com/Morwenn/4441d4d1d01dbaf613cf539ad9c13a2a

If you are currently stuck at home like I am, I hope that this might help you to kill time a bit.
