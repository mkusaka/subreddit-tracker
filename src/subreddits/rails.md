## [2][Rails 5.2.4, Active Storage, and S3: is it possible to implement an effective IAM/ACL policy when the app's default opinion dumps everything into the root of a single bucket?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ij5e6v/rails_524_active_storage_and_s3_is_it_possible_to/)

I have switched from Paperclip to Active Storage. While Active Storage is great, it presents a new set of problems. Paperclip let me set a bucket directory (or even a new bucket), whereas Active Storage dumps everything into the root of a single bucket. I fear that this could create security issues. Improperly set IAM policies are an easy to make no-no, and my app had been using two buckets to avoid the problem: one for public content, and one for private admin accessible content.

In making that two bucket setup work with Active Storage, I tried to use the `service` option for `has_one_attached`. However, I get an ArgumentError: `unknown keyword: service`. The [edge guide](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#setup) implies that this option works in Rails 5.2, but the [guide for 5.2.4](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.4/active_storage_overview.html#has-one-attached) doesn't mention the `service` option at *all*.

How do you lock down access to certain S3 files while being less restrictive with everything else? Is this even possible? Do I have to move to Shrine?

Hi guys!

I have developed an application targeted to municipalities. Each municipality has its own server so in the end,  I will have one code base, and I will have sereval deployments to different servers. So far I have just one client and its working fine. I Believe in the future I will get more clients and I need to plan everything the best I can.

Using Capistrano, I have set a second environment, "staging" to test before production.wn server so in the end,  I will have one code base, and I will have sereval deployments to different servers. So far I have just one client and its working fine. I Believe in the future I will get more clients and I need to plan everything the best I can.

I won't lie: I feel I won't have enough control and knowledge before this step, but I need to grow the business.

Any advice or tips to manage all theses servers and configurations without getting crazy?  


Any pf you having a similar business model?

I have images that I need to be seeded on to my heroku database. here's how I achieve this on development server

&amp;#x200B;

    #seed.rb
    ...
    path = Dir.glob("path/to/images/logos/#{row['url']}/*.*").first
    if path file_io = File.open(path) 
    file_name = File.basename(path) 
    file_ext = file_name.split('.')[1] 
    t.logo.attach(io: file_io, filename: file_name, content_type: "image/{file_ext}") 
    end 
    ...

Would there be a way to do it on heroku production server?

UPDATE: Forgot to mention that i use GCS for file storage

error I get

    YAML syntax error occurred while parsing /Users/admin/Desktop/ruby/rails/launchzilla/config/storage.yml. Please note that YAML must be consistently indented using spaces. Tabs are not allowed. Error: (&lt;unknown&gt;): could not find expected ':' while scanning a simple key at line 29 column 1

I am pretty sure its the Private key part, because I have tested all the scenarios, and when I remove private key part the yml seem to parse corectly, but of course I get error when trying to upload, since GCS setting are incorrect then. Any ideas?

Hey all, I work for a company that's considering a major redo of their e-commerce platform. We're considering a bunch of frameworks for this: Rails, Laravel, Django, and Node. So I thought I'd ask the community here what would be some good reasons for Rails over these others? Thanks so much in advance. :)
