Post a link to a GitHub repo that you would like to have reviewed, and brace yourself for the comments!
Whether you're a junior wanting your code sharpened or a senior interested in giving some feedback and have some time to spare, 
this is the place.

Last night I dreamed that I had been working on an open-sourced JavaScript representation of the US Government, a couple rogue admins on the project began merging PRs from a number of devs that wanted to undermine the system, and the entire thing began to degrade in quality and spaghettify to the point where it was nearly impossible to refactor.

The rogue admins even began overwriting the repo's commit history. I woke up in a cold sweat, then felt relieved that it was just a dream.

It was a nightmare, but I'd honestly be interested in working on a project like that (sans the rogue actors).

Anyway thanks for listening. What coding nightmare has woken you up at night?

EDIT: You all need therapy.
