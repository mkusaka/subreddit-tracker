I'm a daily React developer but I've never taken the time to really get into the internals of how things actually work. I'm a long-time generalist who sticks with the 20% of knowledge that amounts to 80% of the results. However, I've (arbitrarily) decided that 2020 is the year that I will try to become a specialist in *something,* so why not React?

To this end, I'm trying to build my own (simple) version of React from scratch. There are some really great resources out there of how to do it on your own, but I'm purposefully trying it ignore them and go from my memory and high level understanding of how React works.  I'm writing about my learning experiences and my latest post is at [https://vedranb.com/blog/building-react-hooks/](https://vedranb.com/blog/building-react-hooks/) 

Although this is one approach to learning, I want to ask those who consider themselves to be advanced React developers a few questions:

1. What helped you evolve from beginner/intermediate to advanced with React?
2. Was the time spent to get to that stage worth it?
3. What do you think are the biggest differences between an intermediate and advanced React developer?

Thanks!

 What is the best practice to call the API on a page? Let say I have a product page where products need to be displayed through an API call from redux Action. Should I call that action in every componentWillMount() or only when I don't have data inside the Redux store?

I have searched a lot and found multiple people having this problem, but only answers that don't apply to my situation or did not fix my problem. I copied the Quickstart code and ran it locally, which work perfectly. but as soon as I implement my own code it fails.

Ik want my users to be able to select files from their Google Drive storage. I've read multiple of Google's official tutorials/quickstarts and I just can't get it working. In my index.html I put the script tag `&lt;script src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js" async defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.`  


I have a component that shows a signin button when not signed in and an show files button when signed in. My `componentDidMount` looks as following:

    componentDidMount()
    {
        gapi.load('client:auth2', ()=&gt;
        {
            const {api_key, client_id} = Credentials.web;
            const scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file";
            const discoveryDocs = ["https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest"];
            gapi.client.init({apiKey: api_key, clientId: client_id, discoveryDocs: discoveryDocs, scope: scope})
            .then(()=&gt;
            {
                const auth = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance();
                auth.isSignedIn.listen(this._updateStatus);
                this._updateStatus(auth.isSignedIn.get());
                this._authInstance = auth;
            }, this.props.onError);
        });   
    }

This works as expected, no errors , everything seems fine. Then when the sign in button is clicked, I perform the following code:

    this._authInstance.signIn().then(()=&gt; this.props.onLoad(false), error=&gt; {this.props.onLoad(false); this.props.onError(error)});

This opens a new blank window  to Google that says connecting... but never loads anything. When I go back to my own page, there is an error with `popup_blocked_by_browser.`  


I copied the Quickstart code and ran it locally, which, of course, works perfectly. I also tried to move everything outside react, having the code the same as in the Quickstart script(have all functions in script tags inside the index.html) but this gives me the same result as having the code in my componentDidMount.   


Any ideas?
