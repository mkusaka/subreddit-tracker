Background:

My younger siblings wanted us all to play Minecraft together while everyone is sheltering in place, so I ended up configuring a server for us on AWS. I also created an administrative app in Rails to manage that which I'll eventually open-source.

I know there is an existing RCON gem, but the project appears to be dead and I wasn't particularly fond of the implementation.

I plan to write a Minecraft specific wrapper around this as well :)
## [6][How to manage Ruby dependencies from the point of view of a NodeJS / npm dev?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/fssk1h/how_to_manage_ruby_dependencies_from_the_point_of/)

I come from NodeJS where dependencies are managed:  


* Locally with \`npm install X\`
* Optionally globally with \`npm install --global X\`

With Ruby, it seems that its by default global with \`gem install X\`

How to install locally? I dont feel comfortable installing anything globally unless its a CLI tool that I use for different projects.

Especially when rails is involved (or expected to be, I suppose) I see a lot of `if defined?(Rails)`. While googling, and the way I prefer honestly, is injection.

    module MyGem
      class &lt;&lt; self
        attr_writer :logger
    
        def logger
          @logger ||= Logger.new($stdout).tap do |log|
            log.progname = self.name
          end
        end
      end
    end

with an initializer with `MyGem.logger = Rails.logger`.

What's preferred these days? Anyone have an opinion on the topic?
## [8][Rails adoption higher than combined PHP frameworks on large sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/fsg94m/rails_adoption_higher_than_combined_php/)

Comparing stats for PHP and Rails on https://www.similartech.com/compare/php-vs-ruby-on-rails Rails has 485,094 to PHP's 7,153,038. However, the combined total for PHP frameworks - Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Yii, MODX &amp; CakePHP - is 447,995 so when a framework is used (not a CMS) Rails adoption is slightly higher than PHP on large sites. Am I missing something?
