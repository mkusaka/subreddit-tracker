Howdy folks!

Like most new developers, I started as a puts developer. Then, I discovered pry-byebug and debugging things got a lot easier.

So for those of you who can‚Äôt wrap their head around pry-byebug debugger, I wrote a hands-on tutorial that‚Äôll walk you through its most basic commands.

You‚Äôll learn how to: ‚è∏ Pause code execution üÜï Get current values ‚è≠ Move on to the next line and wait ‚èèÔ∏è Run code execution until the end of the process

## [4][Rails 4 callback sequence](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fwhyyb/rails_4_callback_sequence/)

Hi, I hope you all are healthy.

I need to know how to enforce sequence in callbacks.

e.g -&gt; `after_create :fun_a, :fun_b, :fun_c`  
In above code, suppose I want AR object to call these callbacks in order: `fun_a -&gt; fun_b -&gt; fun_c`  
Is there anyway to achieve this?  


Thanks :)
## [5][Getting started with GraphQL: Trying to do an update mutation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fw9271/getting_started_with_graphql_trying_to_do_an/)

EDIT: Solution for how I fixed this is at the bottom!

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there.

So over the past few weeks I've been messing around with Ruby, Rails and lately also GraphQL. At the moment I have a demo project which is an api server with users and posts in a one to many relationships, and so far I've managed to do a lot of different queries with them, and also mutations to create new ones of either type.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is that I am trying to make an update post mutation with the following code:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6m3icfx83ar41.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea26d914acccbb9b9b836666042135175cb3da8

so I can make a query that looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zqn47ujb3ar41.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50ac65745efc8623d134a7d2ae0ea5790d7cf66f

problem I am having though is that it wants me to provide the user id of the post to update, even though I am not interested in updating that field.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, how do I need to structure the mutation so that I can update any of the fields independently of one another, instead of having to provide everything?

I know there is probably something really simple that I am missing, I have found the documentation either really hard to find, seemingly outdated, or extremely basic.

&amp;#x200B;

best regards

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: You are all an amazing community, with your help the problem was solved like so:

I've posted about them before but was curious and went ahead in the curriculum, but as a part of their free extensive Rails course, they have a large section (14.5 hrs) of testing at AppAcademy Open

https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/rails/rails-testing--intro

Here is a look at most of it:

Just another resource for those out there who may feel they are fuzzy and this might help fill some gaps, or be the main learning path.

Hey! I just want to share with you a gem we've been working on recently and it's about form objects. 

Me and my coworkers built an abstraction to handle these form objects in one of our client's projects, and provided it was so helpful we decided to extract it to a gem.

I would really appreciate every early feedback I can get, we just published v0.1.0.

I am new to rails and I am trying to make a tinder clone using this tutorial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5gAaZq-sPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5gAaZq-sPs)   (22min)

I have set up slider  but the buttons just don't do anything this this is the code for the buttons:

&lt;button class="controls" id="decline"&gt;No&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;button class="controls" id="approve"&gt;Yes&lt;/button&gt;

The button seem not to be linked with the actual slider, what am I doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

This is the js:

&amp;#x200B;

$(function(){

var $activeSlide = $('#slides .slide:first-child');

&amp;#x200B;

// show first slide

$activeSlide.addClass("showing");

&amp;#x200B;

$("#decline").on("click", function(){

goToSlide('decline');

&amp;#x200B;

});

&amp;#x200B;

$("#approve").on("click", function(){

goToSlide('approve');

console.log(action);

&amp;#x200B;

});

&amp;#x200B;

function goToSlide(action){

$activeSlide.removeClass("showing");

&amp;#x200B;

// send data to controller

if(action == "approve"){

&amp;#x200B;

} else {

&amp;#x200B;

$activeSlide.addClass("showing");

&amp;#x200B;

//slides\[currentSlide\].className = 'slide';

//currentSlide = (n+slides.length)%slides.length;

//slides\[currentSlide\].className = 'slide showing';

}

});

I'm building in-house applications for a company using Rails/React. I'd like to have a 'main' page where users in the company can login and then have a selection of applications to choose from ('accounts', 'dashboard', 'audits'). I'd like to use devise for auth. How would I implement this? Seems like I'd have to have all the other apps running on separate servers and pass the devise credentials along? Each user in the company has different access privileges. There's also a public facing implementation of 'dashboard' where people can view it but cannot perform any CRUD. No login for the public. Here's an example of the wireframe for 'dashboard' UML:

&amp;#x200B;

And again, I also have an app called 'accounts' and 'audits'. There's probably not much of a relationship between the tables in each app.

I've got an existing Rails app, and I want to add some modern Javascript features to existing pages. Think taking existing elements and forms and making them feel more interactive.

I saw the [GoRails video on using Vue slots](https://gorails.com/episodes/vue-js-slots), and started going down that route, until I realised the way it works is quite a hack (it takes your existing HTML and recreates it all in Vue which is bad for performance).

Stimulus seems to be somewhat unmaintained (last release was a year ago) so I'm wondering if there is something else I should be using.

After I read recently (yeah I'm late to the party) that you can now use Chrome (instead of webkit with hellish QT dependencies) I tried to go back to "full-stack" integration or feature tests.

Everything is working so far (on my Mac) but I can't get it to run headless. 

Gemwise I've got `rspec-rails`, `capybara-selenium` and `webdrivers` and my feature spec_helper looks like this: https://gist.github.com/2called-chaos/c71af67a5e730f05d5e2e85a58cf9efa#file-feature_helper-rb

I roughly followed [this article](https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/from-capybara-webkit-to-headless-chrome-and-chromedriver/) and that's also where I got the config from. Thing is that I did not install anything (my assumption is that the webdrivers gem is there to install and update the drivers) but then I found [an issue on capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/2065) that says that ChromeDriver does not support chromeOptions. 

So how do I get it to run headless?
## [12][How to retain selected tab with bootstrap nav tabs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fvzz61/how_to_retain_selected_tab_with_bootstrap_nav_tabs/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/fvzz61/how_to_retain_selected_tab_with_bootstrap_nav_tabs/
---
I have an application that is using bootstrap nav tabs at the top of a div. Depending on what tab I am on the form will be doing things. If I submit on one of the tabs it just goes back and laods the page and defaults to the original selected tab. What is the best way to set the current nav tab so when I make a change or submit it stays there?
