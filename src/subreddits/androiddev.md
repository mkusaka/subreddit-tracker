Hi,  
The reason I wanted your opinion is that I just moved to a new team and their project is being developed for 4 years now. and this is the first time in my career that I'm experiencing this.

There are tons of classes, tons of base classes..., some parts don't have any architectures at all(imagine Activities with 600 lines of code, no DI, API calls in Activity and etc.) and some minor parts do have MVVM/CleanArch implemented.

\-How do you start reading these large codebases that have mixed architectures/no architecture in order to be able to understand and contribute to?

On a scale of "you can but at your own risk" to "pretty foolish", how would you rate using Jetpack Compose in production?

Currently want to start a new project and investigating how foolish using Jetpack Compose might be
## [9][Where to find documentation for android features that require root permission?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hxkp4k/where_to_find_documentation_for_android_features/)

I mean is there a community or a specific place that I can look for docs/tutorial for features that are only available for devices with root privilege.

A list of thing that I can do with root privilege and code samples for that will be helpful. 

Forgive me it this question is stupid..

I'm about to start a new project and would love to use Jetpack Compose but it seems far from production ready (please correct me if I'm wrong).

So far, I've come across Litho(https://fblitho.com/) and will like to ask what this subs opinion on the framework is.
## [11][Widgets do not refresh, until I specifically turn off "Manage apps automatically" in battery section [VIDEOPROOF] - WHY?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hxkerv/widgets_do_not_refresh_until_i_specifically_turn/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hxkerv/widgets_do_not_refresh_until_i_specifically_turn/

I know that widgets, or pretty much anything running on background SOMETIMES does not work properly until excluded from battery optimization - but this is brand new problem I recently discovered.

[Here is video of my widget which refuses to update](https://imgur.com/a/JeUV3Om) until I turn off "Manage apps automatically" in battery section, on android 10 emulator. I can reproduce it on most phones or emulator (with A9/10), but sometimes (maybe 20% cases) its totally random and works even with if manage apps automatically is checked on.

It is really pain in the ass developping anything background-related - nothing works as it should, nothing is reliable. It is very frustrating...**Anybody has experiences how to make widgets refresh properly?** Thanks a lot for help!

*PS: Sure I can upload code, but even minimalistic example has a lot, lot of code (widgets provider, widget background JobIntentService, android manifest declaration, layout, layout provider, etc) so maybe somebody had same problem before and knows the answer without code*

Hello Droids!  
Some of you might remember me from a couple Jetpack Compose related projects that I posted here -[https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fvmktf/learn\_jetpack\_compose\_from\_examples\_that\_show\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fvmktf/learn_jetpack_compose_from_examples_that_show_the/)

In preparation for a talk that I recently gave, I decided to answer some "Frequently Asked Questions" about Jetpack Compose. In order to share it more widely, I decided to host it on a site that I maintain. You can find it here - [https://jetpackcompose.app/faq](https://jetpackcompose.app/faq)

Since not everyone is a fan of clicking on random links, here is what to expect -

I would love to know if there are any more questions that should be a part of the list. And yes, I promise to add a question that addresses "Process Death" in Jetpack Compose(given how popular that topic is on this subreddit :D).
