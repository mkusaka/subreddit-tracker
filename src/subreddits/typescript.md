## [2][Add property to a type](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hzvwp6/add_property_to_a_type/)

Hi,
I am starting out with typescript and have been stuck on this problem for some time.

I have an object type whose keys are in an enum. So I made it the following way.

```
type MyType = {
    [x in myenum]: string;
}
```

This works. However I need to add one more property to it, say `id:number` I have tried using the extends method as well as directly adding it. But it did not work.

Any suggestions to make it work?

My situation is I've been studying programming intensely for 3 years now. JS was my first language, then I did a Wordpress plugin in PHP, and now I'm working with Typescript and React. I also know Express and Postgres.

I'm not afraid of a job that is focused on say Rails or Laravel development, I can mostly read Python (dabbled a bit in it early). So I'm confident that i could jump into any Ruby or Python job and be quite capable for an entry level developer. I just would prefer to develop my muscles using TS utility types, is/as, generics that take function arguments etc.

I'm moving to Atlanta which is an easier job market at the bottom that the top 3 where getting any offer at all can be a prize for a junior.

What do you guys think, take anything that comes along or try to get a TS job? I'm confident in my skils and think I could surely get a React or Angular job, I'm less certain about the quantity of jobs that use TS in Atlanta or the wisdom of wanting to work in that specific tech stack.

PS: To clarify, since TS can be on both ends of the stack, I'd be happy if I got to use TS on either end. No complaints about TS/React with a Rails API for example.

**Big shoutout to this community, y'all are there to share the love and frustration of being a developer.** Been stuck the past 2 days with this.

**ERROR**
```
./src/index.tsx
Failed to compile
Module not found: Can't resolve 'images/LOL.png'
```
----

Tried all the stuff on Stackoverflow like:

1. Using ``index.d.ts, or global.d.ts, or react-app-env.d.ts`` trick with ``/// &lt;reference path='./index.d.ts'/&gt;``
```
declare module '*.png';

// or
declare module "*.png" {
  const content: string;
  export default content;
}
```

2. Tried ``webpack file-loader``

3. Delete ``node_modules`` and try again

4. Changing up the import like
```
import * as LOL from 'images/LOL.png'
import * as LOL from '../images/LOL.png'

import LOL from 'images/LOL.png'
import LOL from '../images/LOL.png'
```

5. Adding ``"esModuleInterop": true,`` to ``tsconfig.json``

------

Still getting the same error. I'm sure this is just some easy thing I overloooked.

------

# EDIT: SOLVED thx to sub

I created fresh react app with typescript and then modified ``react-app-env.d.ts`` with ``typeRoots: [ 'src/react-app-env.d.ts' ]``.

```
declare module '*.png';
```

An example using typeorm and typedi;

    // resolver.ts
    import { Resolver } from "type-graphql";
    import { Inject } from "typedi";
    import { User } from "./user.entity";
    import { UserService } from "./user.service";
    
    @Resolver(User)
    export class UserResolver {
      @Inject("UserService")
      public readonly userService: UserService;
    
      // ...
    }
    =================
    // service.ts
    import { Service } from "typedi";
    import { InjectRepository } from "typeorm-typedi-extensions";
    import { Repository } from "typeorm";
    import { User } from "./user.entity";
    
    @Service("UserService")
    export class UserService {
      @InjectRepository(User)
      protected readonly userRepo: Repository&lt;User&gt;;
    
      // ...
    }

And

    // resolver.ts
    import { Resolver } from "type-graphql";
    import { User } from "./user.entity";
    import { UserService } from "./user.service";
    
    @Resolver(User)
    export class UserResolver {
      public readonly userService = new UserService();
    
      // ...
    }
    =================
    // service.ts
    import { getRepository } from "typeorm";
    import { User } from "./user.entity";
    
    export class UserService {
      protected readonly userRepo = getRepository(User);
    
      // ...
    }

Both works but I genuinely want to know what advantage typedi provides here or is it just a fancy way of writing it

## [8][Can I defined how two types union?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hzoybx/can_i_defined_how_two_types_union/)

Say I have this type:

    interface MyType&lt;T, U&gt; {
      foo&lt;V&gt;(cb: (param: T) =&gt; V): MyType&lt;V, U&gt;
      bar&lt;W&gt;(cb: (param: U) =&gt; W): MyType&lt;W, U&gt;
    }

Is it possible for me to tell TypeScript that `MyType&lt;T, never&gt; | MyType&lt;never, U&gt;` is equivalent to `MyType&lt;T, U&gt;`?

## Why I want this:

If I have some value that implicitly gets typed as `MyType&lt;T, never&gt; | MyType&lt;never, U&gt;`, I can't use the value as expected.

Example:

    declare function myFunction1(): MyType&lt;number, never&gt; | MyType&lt;never, string&gt;;
    
    myFunction1()
      .foo((myNumber) =&gt; { /* ... */ })
      .bar((myString) =&gt; { /* ... */});

This results in: `This expression is not callable. Each member of the union type '(&lt;V&gt;(cb: (param: number) =&gt; V) =&gt; MyType&lt;V, never&gt;) | (&lt;V&gt;(cb: (param: never) =&gt; V) =&gt; MyType&lt;V, string&gt;)' has signatures, but none of those signatures are compatible with each other.ts(2349)`

But I want it to work like this:

    declare function myFunction2(): MyType&lt;number, string&gt;;
    
    myFunction2()
      .foo((myNumber) =&gt; { /* ... */ })
      .bar((myString) =&gt; { /* ... */});

Hello guys, I am trying to type safe a react hook that uses axios for making requests, I am not being able to use axios\[method\] inside the function it gives me the error, I don't get it. It works if I only put the get in the enum though...

https://preview.redd.it/y9ieobjgwld51.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcc38555dc3e8d671c85dd8abb873dcbcfaaa8e1

error is: This expression is not callable.Each member of the union type '(&lt;T = any, R = AxiosResponse&lt;T&gt;&gt;(url: string, data?: any, config?: AxiosRequestConfig | undefined) =&gt; Promise&lt;R&gt;) | (&lt;T = any, R = AxiosResponse&lt;T&gt;&gt;(url: string, config?: AxiosRequestConfig | undefined) =&gt; Promise&lt;...&gt;)' has signatures, but none of those signatures are compatible with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: fixed by changing to:

`const response = await axios(url, { method, data: body })`

if anyone knows a workaround to keep it with the other syntax I would appreciate.

Hello,

So I'm trying to get to grips with functional programming in Typescript and I figured I'd implement the needed functionality myself to understand best. The goal is to have point free code style and implement the framework for that as I go.

Currently I'm a bit stuck at the following problem:

    const fnAnd = (arg1: any) =&gt; (arg2: any) =&gt; Boolean(arg1) &amp;&amp; Boolean(arg2);
    const fnKey = &lt;T extends object&gt;(key: keyof T) =&gt; (val: T) =&gt; val?.[key];
    const fnSame = &lt;T&gt;(arg1: T) =&gt; (arg2: T) =&gt; arg1 === arg2;
    
    const isZero = fnSame(0); // (arg2: number) =&gt; boolean
    
    interface Vector {
      x: number;
      y: number;
    }
    
    const vecX = fnKey&lt;Vector&gt;('x'); // (val: Vector) =&gt; number
    const vecY = fnKey&lt;Vector&gt;('y'); // (val: Vector) =&gt; number
    
    // how to do this bit point-free?
    const isZeroVectorÂ = // (vec: Vector) =&gt; boolean
        (vec:Â Vector)Â =&gt;
            fnAnd
                (fnCompose(isZero,Â vecX)(vec))
                (fnCompose(isZero,Â vecY)(vec));

What is the fp solution for composing with curried multi-arity functions like fnAnd here?
