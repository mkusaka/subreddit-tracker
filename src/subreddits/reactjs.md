Hey everyone, so I recently decided to build my portfolio website using react. I soon realised that my design was a top nav bar with content below just like every other website on the Internet.

That's why I'm here asking for some inspiration. Which portfolio websites have you come across that are great and different from what we usually see.

Put your portfolio websites below and we all can have a look!

Hey, React js community, earlier I posted my [portfolio website](https://karanpratapsingh.com/) in [this thread], thanks for all the good words it was inspired by a friend. After a lot of DMs I decided to immediately opensource it.

Website: https://karanpratapsingh.com

Github: https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/portfolio

Hope this helps, it is fully configurable via configs so it should be easy to make it your own.

As always feedback is welcome, and my DMs are open if you have any questions or wanna work with me.

Have a great day!

I have added svgr to my webpack config. When importing a svg in a component, I have a string: `a8ef8eeaa76ec666d9b8ee7e93eea4c4.svg` instead of the actual svg. How to fix this?

Here is the webpack config with svgr:

    module: {
          rules: [
            {
              test: /\.(ts|js)x?$/,
              exclude: /node_modules/,
              use: { loader: "babel-loader" },
            },
            { test: /\.css$/, use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"] },
            { test: /\.(png|jpg|gif)$/, use: ["file-loader"] },
            {
              test: /\.svg$/,
              use: ["@svgr/webpack"],
            },
          ],
        },
    

And the component:

    import React from "react";
    import Upload from "../../assets/svg/upload.svg";
    
    export default function Icon() {
      return &lt;div&gt;{Upload}&lt;/div&gt;;
    }

I'm writing tests for my react components and run into some questions which I couldn't find anywhere.

So I have this `Dropdown` button which uses `react-redux` state:

    const Dropdown = (option, dispatch) =&gt; {
        ...
        return (
            ...
            &lt;button&gt;{ option }&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;div id="dropdown-menu"&gt;
                &lt;a onClick={ selectOption }&gt;Some option&lt;/a&gt; // selectOption dispatches an action which select the option and updates the button's text
                ...
            &lt;/div&gt;
            ...
        );
    }
    
    const mapState = (state) =&gt; {
        return {option: state.option};
    }

I will omit `redux` 's boiler-plates like `action` and `reducer` because they are pretty straightforward in my case. I wrap the root component in `Provider` and pass the `store` to it.

I'm testing this component with `redux-mock-store` and so far I can test whether my dispatched actions are in the mocked `store` or not. Since the `store` is mocked it does not update the component. What I like to test is the updated text on the button when I choose an option like `expect(wrapper.find("button").text()).toEqual("Changed text")` with `enzyme`.

So how do I test this case? Should I use the actual store instead of mocking this? Is this a bad practice? Should I even be testing the updated UI? Please give me some advice on this. Thanks.

I'm struggle a little bit on how to proceed to create an easy "page builder" . All components are already done but the struggle now is how the structure is going to be loaded. 

My tough is to  store a object called layout which then will be loaded from the back-end and then do a map function when the component and object are loaded. I tough it would be possible to somehow sort all objects in the row array so it will be displayed in correct order during loading.

Its for a web shop maybe good to mention so my idea is that the user that ownes the web-shop, login as admin then can create different layouts based on pre-defined components which i build.  Then based on the location add it to the right container in the UI.

I wonder if there is a another solution to do this or if this is even a good way of solve it? Below is the structure I was thinking or at least something similar. Is a good or bad approach?

Not sure if this makes sense at all so please feel free to provide me with feedback, thanks for the support of all the other threads during my learning period of react :)
