It's written completely in Kotlin (Kotlin/JS/React + Kotlin/JVM/Spring Boot).

This pet project was inspired by a book called 'Make it Stick'. Its authors claim that learning can be more efficient if combined with information retrieval at points of forgetting.

You can:

* Create questions with answers (markdown, code highlighting, and multiple-choice questions are supported)
* Add tags and topics to questions
* Combine questions to quizzes
* Test yourself with your questions
* Get some simple tag/topic-based analysis
* Share quiz links with the world

P.S. I'm a Python developer but I decided to give up on Python. I have finally figured out that Kotlin\*Java &gt; Python.

Hi all,

I work at a place where all the backend systems are in python or typescript. Soon we will be setting up a new project that will be one of our core systems. The models we develop will be interfacing with third party and open sources libraries, which provide APIs to popular languages like Java, Python, C++ AND C#.

As the models need to interface with the libraries  we have to select a language to implement the models in. Whilst there is no JVM language in use in our backend systems I want to suggest using Kotlin to do the modelling in. But I am not sure how to convince my manager in approving that. He isn't firmly against it but he will need to have good reason to not do Python or Java. 

So here is my reasons:

* The models we do are relatively complex where the Kotlin's type safety is very useful. Hence Kotlin will be much easier to work with. 

* Kotlin is more succint than Java and introduces null safety. 

* His main concern I think is lack of Kotlin devs and that it is a relatively new language to which I want to say that any Java dev should be able to pick uo Kotlin relatively fast and thag Kotlin is used in production pretty widely and has rhe wide support of the Java ecosystem. 

I feel like these reasons alone may not be compelling enough, so I'd like to know how you introduced Kotlin at your work place. Are there better reasons for why we should use Kotlin and how did you do it?

You can connect to your app, record events, then rewind you app's state back, inspect events' content and even fire-and-debug them.

I have been using Kotlin for 1 year now. I have used it both with Spring Boot backend and Android.

## [8][Problem exporting Typescript definitions in 1.4-M1 (from commonMain)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gkq2uc/problem_exporting_typescript_definitions_in_14m1/)

I'm having trouble with the new typescript definition export from Kotlin in 1.4-M1 ðŸ˜“

1. Adding @ JsExport outside jsMain source directory in multiplatform Gradle project does not work\*? So this means that one cannot export type definitions for types that are shared between platform targets?
2. When creating a regular kotlin/js project in IntelliJ, I cannot find a way to activate the new  IR back-end compiler and the definition export - I assume this is not supported?

Typescript definition export would simplify my current project dramatically, so I keep hoping it would be possible to get at least one of these options working? ðŸ¤ž

*\* this image illustrates the problem - is this the expected behavior?*

Calculating the length of a track in a GPX file:

    override fun startElement(uri: String, lName: String, qName: String, att: Attributes) {
        if (qName != "trkpt")
            return
        att.getValue("lat")?.toDouble().let { lat -&gt;
            att.getValue("lon")?.toDouble().let { long -&gt;
                if (lastLat != null &amp;&amp; lastLong != null)
                    _dist += haversine(lat, long)
                lastLat = lat
                lastLong = long
            }
        }
    }

    private fun haversine(lat: Double, long: Double): Double {
        /* omitted for brevity */
    }

Kotlinc complains about a "type mismatch: inferred type is Double? but Double was expected" in the call to `haversine`. I can fix it easily enough by changing the `let` calls to be like:

        att.getValue("lat")?.toDouble()?.let { lat -&gt;
            att.getValue("lon")?.toDouble()?.let { long -&gt;

But why is it giving me a Double? and not a Double in the first place? If I look at the documentation for `String.toDouble()` it's clearly listed as returning type Double (not nullable). Makes no sense I should have to type the extra question mark.
