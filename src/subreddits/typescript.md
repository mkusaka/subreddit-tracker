The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring company—no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job.

Handle dates 

Does anyone have a good helper function to handle dates in JavaScript/typescript?

For example if the date is 2020-09-27 and you want to add 7 days to the date it updates correctly. Should be 2020-09-04 after adding 7 days .

Thank you for the help

## [6][Specifying type a promise rejects in defintions (d.ts)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j0b3tn/specifying_type_a_promise_rejects_in_defintions/)

In a TypeScript definition file is it possible to specify what type of error the Promise rejects with?

Right now I've been helping myself with comments. It would be great to get help of the compiler with this.

    /** rejects with CustomErrorType */
    someMethodInAClass(): Promise&lt;void&gt;

I’ve sorta been able to do this in regular TypeScript (not defintions) by defining an async function and simply specifying what it returns.

Is there a way to actually embed the typing information of what you reject into TypeScript? If it matters I'm pretty sure I'll almost always consume this API using async/await stuff.

Hi. I'm looking for exercises aimed at specifics of Typescript. Most of the websites I have looked in, including Codewars, offered me general-type tasks on algorithms, not about Typescript, while I need ones that would require using Typescript-specific (not JS) features, like declaration merging, union types, etc. The only material which I found by this time is mdevils' Typescript Exercises, but I would like to find something with a broader range of topics.  
Can someone provide such exercises?

ES6 is what brings support for things like: 

arrow functions

classes/interfaces

Yet I'm using TS 2.7 with ES5 and I have access to arrow functions, class and interface. What's this sorcery?

Hey everyone! I've been missing this feature for a long time and there was no solution, so yesterday I made an extension for VS Code that generates explicit types. Give it a go if you want :)
