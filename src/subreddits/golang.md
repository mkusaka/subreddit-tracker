This seems to be happening to me, maybe I am going about it wrong:

An example of this behaviour [https://play.golang.org/p/4ythyZW58Pq](https://play.golang.org/p/4ythyZW58Pq)

Run it a few times, sometimes it works - sometimes it doesn't

I have a question about DDD and Golang. Well to be fair, I think my problem it‚Äôs understand DDD. But I think I know how DDD is built... but all examples of DDD in Golang is weird to me. 

For each Domain you must have a folder? For example, for products domain, you must have Infrastructure, Interface, Application, etc. And then for User domain you must replicate again same folders?

Hi all,

I'm working in information security, so my programming experiences is limited to automating small tasks in python or bash.

I'm trying to pick up Golang but it's proven difficult to comprehend all concepts.

As a matter of practice, I'm trying to translate I [small tool written in python](https://github.com/faun88/punycoder/blob/master/punicoder.py) to generate punycode domains for a given domains. I'm already stuck in declaring the homoglyphs as I was trying to declare them in a map but a map doesn't take multiple values per key.

Anyone can get me started?

Hey Everybody. I've been slated to give a 30 minute to 1-hour presentation about GO to the IT department at my job. I was wondering if anyone had any must include ideas, facts, or important points to bring up. The presentation is relaxed and is meant to show off new technologies to the company. So anything really interesting that I can bring up to get people excited and curious would be great. I'm a novice with GO. So any help would be greatly appreciated.

I'd like to use pkg.go.dev to query package licenses and version informations, but I can't find any info regarding a public API? Is there one or was that deemed not necessary?
