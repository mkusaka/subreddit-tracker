This is a random conceptual question but  I was just thinking, at the end of the day when you launch something and you have static files, they're deployed on some website/app. What does Redux/reducer/actions become... just an object/methods?
## [2][[Puzzler] Action creator using function.name](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/gqze1l/puzzler_action_creator_using_functionname/)

Today I encountered interesting bug which was caused by action creators like this:

    export function setCartStatus(status) {
        return {
            type: setCartStatus.name,
            cartStatus: status
        }
    }

All creators had unique names, I checked this several times manually across all modules. All other components (store, reducers etc) were also ok ‚Äî the problem is only in the code given above. Can you spot one?

Note: comments under the post mention solution.

Answer is under the spoiler: &gt;! webpack minimizes function names, and different functions from different modules may happen to have the same minimized name. !&lt;

Hey everyone! So for the last few weeks I‚Äôve been designing and beginning to implement a GraphQL API using Prisma. I‚Äôm at a stage where I have enough of an API foundation to think about developing frontend. I‚Äôll be using react-native and I have a few questions regarding fetching data from my API. I want to be able to provide users with an offline experience and therefore require cache. I also want to use subscriptions (real-time functionality in GraphQL). I‚Äôve found Apollo Client and seen that it has a lot of good reviews, however, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the built in React components that display the data. I haven‚Äôt used them so I can‚Äôt really be sure that I don‚Äôt like them, however I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be great for query testing which isn‚Äôt a huge deal since I‚Äôll be thoroughly testing my API and Prisma is tested. On the other hand I‚Äôve used redux in the past and am wondering if it has the possibly of acting as a sort of cache when paired with simple https requests. Any thoughts are appreciated! üôè

## [5][Is the constructor even needed when using Redux?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/gp5xfa/is_the_constructor_even_needed_when_using_redux/)

I haven‚Äôt yet had any reason to use it since I place all the props I need in mapStateToProps which goes into the connect function. I was pretty good at passing props around in React but now that I have added Redux I‚Äôm not too sure how props are passed around. 

I‚Äôm making an application with Redux because I want to expand my web development ‚Äútoolkit‚Äù. So even though my application doesn‚Äôt really need Redux I‚Äôm just curious about how to use it. I feel like I‚Äôve been taught Redux badly or maybe I‚Äôm just not getting it but if you know of any good resources for me to learn that would be great too.

## [10][Recomendations for Enterprise-scale Nextjs(React)/Redux/Typescript arquitecture](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/gjrykm/recomendations_for_enterprisescale/)

I want to know useful patterns/arquitecture for big enterprise projects used in nextjs(react) with redux. 
i've seen some recomendations like [this](https://laniewski.me/javascript/react/redux/2019/02/28/enterprise-scale-react-redux-project-architecture.html) or [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-organize-your-react-+-redux-codebase)  where application is split in `modules` that encapsulates all related things with it, Redux(actions, reducers, sagas), utils, ts-types, and jsx|tsx components and have one folder for shared things. I like this concept because it is easy to identify the related elements between the store and the ui layer inside modules, but I don't know if it's really scalable for big enterprise projects. I would like to hear recommendations and/or suggested articles.
