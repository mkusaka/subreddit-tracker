I used to be a Python programmer, and when I first started it felt like Python had a lot of cool things JS didn't. Over time though I've grown to know and love JS more, and now I appreciate the many things JS can easily do that Python can't.

But one thing I've never understood is why, in 2020, I still have to use Lodash's `last` method (or some equivalent) to get the last member of an array. In Python you can simply do `myArray[-1]`, and this would seem to be trivially easy to implement in JS.

(Python also has a super-cool slice syntax, where instead of `someArray.slice(1,2)` you can just write `someArray[1:2]` ... but I digress.)

My question is, this idea of accessing the last member of an array via an index of `-1` already exists in other languages, and the "syntactic space" for it in JS is open (we don't have any negative indices already that would break) ... so how come no one has proposed this yet? Is there some obvious downside/reason I'm missing?

Why don't they write an IR for Javascript so that it can be compiled on LLVM
