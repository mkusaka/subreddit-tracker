Hello Guys,

I have finished the HTML, CSS, Js and react-redux course and have practised the fundamentals and advanced topics by making basic apps.

But there is still a need for improvement, are there any tutorials or source where I can find few react/redux projects to practice?
## [7][Help with React and AntD Table. Onclick handler in dropdown menu!](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i6fw93/help_with_react_and_antd_table_onclick_handler_in/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i6fw93/help_with_react_and_antd_table_onclick_handler_in/

Hi there folks.

I am wondering if some more experienced react developers in the community can help me with a 2nd onClick handler and getting access to the data I need in that handler.  I have come up with a solution myself but it feels a little hacky because I am using data attributes to attach data to a html element and am wondering if there is a better way.

**My problem**

I am using the  [antd table component](https://ant.design/components/table/) for displaying data.  The last column of my table is called "action" and this is where I plan to have the "..." elipsis button (like in microsoft teams).  

When you click this button it pops up a menu which the user can then select from differentmenu option.  But when the user clicks the menu item that is 2 onClick handlers. 1 click event for the row in the table, and then the 2nd for the menu selection.

So, in that 2nd onClick handler you need to know 2 things:

* 1 - the original row the user clicked on 
* 2 - the menu option they selected

The problem is that in the 2nd menu onClick handler you only know what menu item the user chose. 

**My solution**

What I decided to do was use [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) to store the table row information in the html.  I converted the table row to json and associated with each menu item.  Like this:

    function TablePopupMenu(data) {
      var json = JSON.stringify(data);
      return (
        &lt;Menu data-id={json} onClick={onClickPopupMenu}&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item data-id={json} key="1"&gt;
            1st menu item
          &lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item data-id={json} key="2"&gt;
            2nd memu item
          &lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item data-id={json} key="3"&gt;
            3rd menu item
          &lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
        &lt;/Menu&gt;
      );
    }

..and then in the 2nd menu onClick handler I have this code to get the table data from the data-id attribute:

    const onClickPopupMenu = (key) =&gt; {
      var json = key.domEvent.target.getAttribute("data-id");
      var tableRowData = JSON.parse(json);
      console.log(`User Clicked on menu ${key.key} - table row: ${tableRowData.name}`);
    };

My question is, I feel like this is anti react and wondering if there is a simpler, better way?

**Code Example**

I have setup a code sandbox with my exampe code here: [https://codesandbox.io/s/focused-glitter-eedby](https://codesandbox.io/s/focused-glitter-eedby)

Any advice, help, steering would be greatly appreciated.

There is a site I found that hosts multiple images of pokemon however performing a get request downloads an image where the size can hundreds of kb or over a mb. Is there anyway to do a get request for a compressed version of the image? I am displaying over 800 of these images on the same page so it can take a long time to download all of these images for a client visiting my site.  


the website for those curious:  [https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/images/pokemon/250.png](https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/images/pokemon/250.png)   


changing the id gets you a different image.

I am planning on creating a form that will send uploaded files to my express backend where I will use multer to save the buffer in mongodb. However, I am confused on how I can retrieve the images. Im thinking of creating an api endpoint that will return the file, but I dont want to display my backend end url in the image src for security, how can I hide it or is there a better way to present the images?

I'm new to react and searching is a bit confusing right now. I hope you could drive me to a solution.   
What I'm looking for is, I have a file uploaded button that uploads a single CSV file. I need to

1. On load of this file parse this file locally and display it in the browser as a table component.
2. I need the ability to add two more columns in addition to the existing columns for displaying any validation error and the result of API call of this line. 
3. The table component must be editable after being loaded. 

Any help with which react libraries I'll be able to achieve this would be great.
