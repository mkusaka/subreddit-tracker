## [3][Rounded Progress Bar Library (My first open source library!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ixxnzs/rounded_progress_bar_library_my_first_open_source/)

Hey Android folks! Over the past month I've been working on my first open source project and Iâ€™m happy to say itâ€™s finally complete. I made a library that allows you to easily create animated, rounded progress bars which are decently customizable.

[A progress bar made with the RoundedProgressBar library](https://i.redd.it/hebnp72vtro51.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

I started this project awhile back as I needed a rounded progress bar for an app I'm making. I tried some SO solutions and some other third party libraries but nothing perfectly matched what I needed in terms of looks. 

Being naive I thought I could make my own progress bar library in a day or two. Unsurprisingly, about *three weeks* later I finished it finally put it on Github and Jitpack. Feel free to take a look at it on Github or to ask questions about it here. If you find it to be a useful library, consider giving the repo a star, itâ€™d be much appreciated!

If you have any suggestions for my library please let me know. Like I said this is my first open source library and I'd love to improve from here.

Hey, I just wrote an article over on medium.com regarding my fun with Google, third-party SDKs and policy changes. 

I hope others will find this article useful. Itâ€™s really not a rant, Iâ€™m passed that now. I'm not expecting the decision to change.  It's just some information to help fellow developers avoid the problems I have come across.  Be very careful with third-party SDKs and with Google constantly changing the goalposts with their policy updates.

Thanks for looking, I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

## [8][Android Studio and Creation of Custom Components: Is it Impossible? Where do i Start?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iy7838/android_studio_and_creation_of_custom_components/)

Hey guys, hope you are all ok.

So, i will go stright foward to the point. WhatÂ´s with customization of components in android studio? IÂ´m trying to find a resourceful post about this in the internet, but iÂ´ve found nothing more than the same basics, not very long, examples on how to do it. I mean, iÂ´m starting to think that iÂ´m very stupid and canÂ´t find any useful info, or maybe those examples are all i need and i just donÂ´t get it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain a little bit more. IÂ´m developing a new app in wich a custom component seems necessary for smothness and operational issues. So, when i was looking for a component (button, seekbar, switches) that suits my needs in the android IDE, didnÂ´t find any. I tried with some of them, and even explore the options that i had found at the moment on google. Eventually, start to think that maybe i should modify one or two of them, BUT, iÂ´m still a beginner so i went to saint google asking for help in forums like stack overflow and blogs that came up. The thing is, i get that i should figure out this kinds of things by myself, itÂ´s not that i want  an example ready to import to my project, itÂ´s really not that. I want lo learn how to do it, i want to be good at it; i just need some guidelines and maybe some posts that have information about it. Or maybe, a list of the things i should understand to start doing it (components composition, functionality, uses of their characteristics, what can be touched and what cannot, in wich method should i work, etc). IÂ´m not giving up on this matter. I really think this is important for my future apps, so thats why iÂ´m asking for some advice on where to start. IÂ´ve manage to modify, finally, one or two components, but everything seems too "tutorialistic", very much like copy/paste. I want to understand it. I donÂ´t care if i have to study a lot, i want it that way, i just donÂ´t know where or what to learn. 

I thank you if you can help me, if you canÂ´t, i thank you anyway. 

Cheers, and please, stay at home. Be safe.

## [12][Flutter vs Native for school project.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iy4c7w/flutter_vs_native_for_school_project/)

I'm currently tasked on a 6 month IoT school project to develop an Android App. The gist of what this app does is retrieve and visualise data from a MySQL database based off sensors (temperature, humidity etc.) The catch is, I dont have any actual experience in app development and I have spent about the first two weeks trying to learn as much as I can.

As I believe this app will be heavily based on the UI with data in multiple forms such as tables, charts, graphs and so on, would it be wise to pick up Flutter from the get go and work with it instead?

Edit: The school only asked for an Android App, however with the nature of this app, personally I would like it to be multi-platform for a larger user audience. (It may also score me extra grades by considering this)
