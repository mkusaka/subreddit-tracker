The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring companyâ€”no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job. 

Posting top level comments that aren't job postings, [that's a paddlin](https://i.imgur.com/FxMKfnY.jpg)

Hey everyone. I know that there are tons of TypeScript starter kits but decided to share mine.

[https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/beginning](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/beginning)

I did it because it's the very minimum setup and can be installed super quickly with just `npx beginning`.

As I continue down the typescript rabbit hole, I've stumbled across something that's puzzling me. I'm used to the `extends` keyword, in Java, signaling that a generic type is covariant. `List&lt;T extends Number&gt;`, for example, would let me know that I can safely get `Number`s from the `List`, but the list might contain any type of `Number`. 

I've run across something that appears to be backwards. Here is a [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/v2/en/play?#code/MYewdgzgLgBAJgQygmBeGBvAUDGAiACwFMAbEkPALkx13wDcESBXIq-AdxACcS48ANLQC+Q3HgBmICtWx0GTVuzwAjBN0EihwrAHpd+YmQowAPvikUsUAJ4AHIjADSYEBzBOiNiGhgBrLxAJGFsHIPgkBCw9AzhmAFsVGABLMCgibgkEYCIsIgAPOx5YVPTM7McAERAAZShmCWC5GAlUuAAhG08bGAAeABUYAvSwOB9oblSAcwA+GAAKAJtqfoBKagnpgG4sHRj4ECIIMAByWC5uPwB+EIJknwQ7B3UfKBAYFUdQNO4ERkmEGkUmAYINUtAiAg4DBwqB-slAVABDASMkAjAAJIwLjMPhDQpEYBQAB0eUKxRgwBICAgPmqdQaEgx8TsJBSLJIRHiRDSdNq9UaNFwrVGnW6iy81Bcbg8Xgg6xgmzAUyFdG4RHq3BBiGQAG0lgBdYmMFi5XA6Pb6eAJJKlDJZHJkorcEppe0VGD0gUSACCUwQqVVIo6XS8fUGwx5Y2crnc3Qgcwly1BCqVUx2loMFz8ECuTopVJpfIZjT9AbAzNZ7NZXJ5UGL3qDbTFXiTGygk2VqY701VuHVmpBSxEuyAA) link with what's puzzling me.

Any ideas why this doesn't work? Reproducing the code below:

```
interface Foo {
  bar: (x: number) =&gt; string
  baz: (y: string) =&gt; number
}

function f&lt;K extends keyof Foo&gt;(
  foo: Foo, 
  method: K, 
  ...params: Parameters&lt;Foo[K]&gt;): void {
    foo[method](...params);
}
```

The TypeScript error is: `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0 or more.`

Should be fairly obvious what I'm trying to do here, but I want to be able to pass a `Foo` object in and call it's method `method` with the correct parameters.
