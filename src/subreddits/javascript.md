My app has become too bloated and it's taking 3 seconds to load. I'm trying to track this down and it looks like it's all script evaluation and includes.

I'd like to build a tree of the includes to see which libraries and includes/requires take up the most time.

I'm sure some of this is due to just stupid includes of entire libraries rather than smaller components.

I just need a way to quantify where the time is being wasted.
