Hey guys, so I recently had a question regarding how much knowledge I should have before trying to freelance and got some great feedback.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/gd178v/askjs\_how\_much\_knowledge\_to\_start\_freelancing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/gd178v/askjs_how_much_knowledge_to_start_freelancing/)

There's the link if anyone is interested in that. From everyone's responses I've gathered that as a newby it would probably be a good idea to look for a job in-house at a company to get some experience under my belt before I attempt to start freelancing.

That being said, I'm curious about what the job market is looking like right now? How likely is it for me to land an entry level position that is also remote? Also how has the COVID-19 situation affected the job market. I'm definitely open to working in an office, but I figure currently that may not really be an option.
