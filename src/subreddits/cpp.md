Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

I see on the web so many say what is better lean C#, I see people  answer a other that say want to learn C++ to learn other language why this?

I heard many times that one shouldn’t start any new project in C++ these days. Comments like “I’m writing in C++ for 20+ years and I hate that language” seem to be pretty common here in reddit. While you may be capped in C++ because of existing code base at work / current project and it may be too late to switch to another language, would you still choose C++ for your project in 2020? Considering that C++ is widely used in your type of projects, e.g if you’d be like to write your own 2D game library to use it for your 2D game of your dream.

I have an idea for 2D game since 2017 and writing 2D framework from scratch is the best option (2D multiplayer Rimworld-alike, could send .docx description in Russian if interesting). Soon I will have time for making it, but I don’t want to regret with language choice in future. Want to hear your opinions, thanks!

i know almost nothing about programming let alone cpp but i know enough to know that i wanna learn a lot more about it no matter the time it takes but i'm having a hard time finding a good source to learn cpp from the ground up for someone who doesn't know much, so id love to hear any advice or recommendations on the topic.

pms are open too

## [9][Order of initializer list vs class members, could choice of fix open exploit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fm6jyg/order_of_initializer_list_vs_class_members_could/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fm6jyg/order_of_initializer_list_vs_class_members_could/
---
I wonder, I have a class that defines an integer and a pointer, a and b. But the constructor initializer list has them in reverse b(), a(). This raises a warning/error and should be fixed, good.

So, I can switch their declarations, or I can switch the initializer list order. My worry is, if I fix by switching the declarations, then the class' binary representation will have them in reverse order. Sibling files to this header have mentions of streams and I see many void\*s and reinterpret cast uses, I dont fully understand the entire code to be sure whether this class is involved or not but I feel like by switching the declarations I could enable an exploit if this class is somehow saved and loaded to/from disk/network at some point, because then i could load a file saved on the previous ordering as the new one.

Am I correct with this worry or am I being paranoid? Is it truly safer to switch the initializer list instead and due to the reason above? (I mean even if it was indeed safer, I could be wrong about the reason)

Hi, Eclipse 2020-03 with CDT 9.11 has been released. Recently a lot of changes to improve c++ support into Eclipse has been performed and a lot of other effort needs to be spent.  I'm curious to know what you think about it. Eclipse is quite popular but there are a lot of alternatives like Visual Studio, CLion, Netbeans and so on. What are you using and why?

Just some improvements so far:

1. A lot of new options for the built-in formatter: improvements for comment formatting, on/off tags
2. Improvements and bug fixes for the refactor: for example the automatic implementation to override methods in child classes
3. Improved the class wizard to create a new class with fresh new C++11 options and according to the rule of five
4. Improved doxygen support for automatic generation of tags
5. Added a lot of new options about compiler warnings
6. Added new C++17 features support, like structured bindings

Some areas where cdt community is currently working for short-term:

1. Integrate all C++17 features into the built-in parser, like CTAD and constexpr lambda expressions (with 9.12 I think 95% should be covered)
2. Improve the support for CMake projects
3. Other Improvements for the static analysis and built-in formatter support

For long-term:

1. There's nothing for C++20 yet, the idea could be to move everything to LSP, it could be a great change
2. Rework the built-in build system to have something more flexible
