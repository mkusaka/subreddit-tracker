I've got some experience with React in the general sense - I know how to use functional components (or the theory of the class components) and I've got a basic app (based on Microsoft Fluent UI) working. I'm using typescript, react-redux toolkit.

I've worked on a large functional component containing everything I need, and I'm now looking to abstract the code. Right now the structure is:

[https://i.ibb.co/27QdYdV/image.png](https://i.ibb.co/27QdYdV/image.png)

\`\`\`Page  
\-- CommandBar  
\----- Refresh action  
\----- Upload action  
\----- Export to CSV action  
\-- DetailsList (grid) with entities  
\----- Row X  
\----- Row Y  
\----- Row Z\`\`\`

Best practice is to apply the single responsibility principle.

The \`CommandBar\` is a FluentUI Component containing multiple  \`ICommandBarItemProps\` to render, each with their own \`onClick\`-handler. Some have impact on the UI (refresh), some have actions attached to them (CSV-export the current grid items on the page).

Since the action (such as refresh) should act on the DetailsList to refresh the grid, I need to somehow link these two together.  As I want to use the actions in a generic sense, so for possibly every grid, this poses a mental problem for me

I see three ways:

1. Pass down the onclick handler as a prop from the "\`Page\`" or "\`CommandBar\`".This seems highly unpractical, because the page will become a a controlling entity, and will become a huge TSX file full of event handlers as the list of actions grows.
2. Trigger the update using reduxOnClick on the button could result in a dispatch() to the redux store. In this case I would need to create an additional prop in the state (shouldRefresh), to which the DetailsList needs to listen to. Alternatively I could dispatch GetData(), which automatically updates the grid.
3. Create a wrapper for every "CommandBar" type I'm going to offer, placing the logic in there, so I will have a "FileListCommmandBar" component. It will then still need to be linked to the DetailsList, which will in case lead to the problem being moved elsewhere.

What is the proposed way of doing this if you want to keep function-components loosely coupled. Please keep in mind that some actions trigger a dialog (upload file) that has its own logic. The Actions should be 'agnostic'. I'm a bit at a loss, and it feels that I'm going to use redux as a glorified event-system rather than a state management machine.

Hopefully someone can give me some guidance, maybe I'm way off (I hope I am, so I can learn) but i'm a bit stuck.

I'm just starting a new reactjs project. It has a UI but it's only used to write data to the backend that will later be consumed via API calls.  Speed is a necessity but only for serving the data via API. 

My questions are... 

1. would you guys recommend me using the new and shiny Recoil since it's a new project? 
2. do you think recoil is overkill?
3. do you think maybe I should just use Context?
