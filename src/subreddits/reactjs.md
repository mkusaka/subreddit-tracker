I had some spare time on a plane flight, so I took the opportunity to hack away at one of my TODO sticky notes.

* [use-ctrl-key](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-ctrl-key): Listen to if the Ctrl key is pressed. `const ctrlKey: boolean = useCtrlKey();`
* [use-key-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-key-down): Given a key, listen to if it is pressed. `const isEnterKeyDown: boolean = useKeyDown('Enter');`
* [use-mouse-move](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-mouse-move): Listen to mouse movement. `const [x, y] = useMouseMove();` Supports absolute, client, movement (relative), offset, page, and screen coordinates.

Hi guys,

I've been struggling with using React Context and TypeScript. I've managed to get the context to work and pass data correctly to the subscribed components, however I'm struggling to know how to type the createContext function. I know it expects a defaultValue, but I'm confused what it should be.

I'm getting the following TypeScript error in my context file under the createContext function:

    (alias) createContext&lt;unknown&gt;(defaultValue: unknown): React.Context&lt;unknown&gt;
    import createContext
    Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.ts(2554)
    index.d.ts(385, 9): An argument for 'defaultValue' was not provided.
    Peek Problem (Alt+F8)
    No quick fixes available

This is my Context:

    import React, {useState, createContext} from 'react';
    
    interface NewPartyProviderProps {
        children: React.ReactNode
    }
    
    type NewParty = {
        name: string
    }
    
    export const NewPartyContext = createContext();
    
    export const NewPartyProvider = ({children}: NewPartyProviderProps) =&gt; {
        const [newParty, setNewParty] = useState&lt;NewParty&gt;({name: ""});
    
        return (
            &lt;NewPartyContext.Provider value={[newParty, setNewParty]}&gt;
                {children}
            &lt;/NewPartyContext.Provider&gt;
        )
    }

And I'm using it in a component like this:

    const NewPartyName = ({ navigation }: NewPartyNameProps) =&gt; {
    
      const [newParty, setNewParty] = useContext(NewPartyContext);
    
      return (...)
    
    }

Any help would be much appreciated! :)

A client of mine suggested that we try Stackbit but it feels like it isn't too "customizable" or flexible. I'd like to know your thoughts about it and the challenges you've faced using it.

[https://i.ibb.co/LNRH21c/multiple-slider-design.png](https://i.ibb.co/LNRH21c/multiple-slider-design.png)   


I am trying to create a slider which looks roughly similar to the photo attached. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know you can make multiple knobs by providing `defaultValue={[35,50,77]}` or something similar to the `&lt;Slider/&gt;` component as props. But I want to style the tracks and the individual knobs aswell. Is it possible? If not, is there any other way to achieve this apart from building my own component from scratch?
