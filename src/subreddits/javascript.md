## [3][[AskJS] Today I learned of the text/speech apis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/gckiuc/askjs_today_i_learned_of_the_textspeech_apis/)

Browser JavaScript has a couple APIs that, as far as I know, are lesser-known. Just thought I'd share them since they're kind of interesting.

SpeechSynthesis is a text-to-speech API.

SpeechSynthesis.getVoices() returns an array of voice objects. When tested on Chrome in my browser, I got 21 different voices with assorted genders and accents. MS Edge only had 3.

SpeechSynthesisUtterance instances hold your text and chosen voice. You use the whole api like this:

    let u = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Some text to speak");
    u.voice = SpeechSynthesis.getVoices()[0];
    SpeechSynthesis.speak(u); 

And then there's also speech to text. Firefox calls it SpeechRecognition, while Chrome calls it webkitSpeechRecognition. You can look it up for more information, especially its onerror event handler, but the basic method works like this:

    let sr = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
    let textOutput = "";
    sr.onresult = function(e){textOutput = e.results[0][0].transcript;};
    sr.start(); 

I can see these being useful as accessibility features or things for users to play with, but as a webdev, I've never had to use either of these. Is this the first time you've heard of it? If not, have you ever had to use it before?

Hi guys!

I'm going to pick up Javascript now, and just want to look forward to things to excite myself with. What are some cool things that can only be done with Javascript?

I've been putting this aside for the longest time, having started off (and back then, content) with Python. But I've come across some Flask functionalities that necessitate JavaScript (dependent dropdowns), and thought I'd bite the bullet and pick it up!
