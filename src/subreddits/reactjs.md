As the sub grows we want to keep the experience great for everyone. One of the best ways to do this is to allow people to filter for and filter out the exact types of content they are looking for. So we are now requiring flairs for every new post.

Here are the current set of flairs ([inspired by /r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/euprlf/changes_to_rpython/)):

- Show /r/reactjs: for libraries and apps you made and want to show off
- Needs Help: For people who need help. We may refer you to /r/LearnReactjs or the monthly Beginner's Thread.
- Resource: if you find a cool library to use, awesome book to read, etc. Posting your own blogpost is allowed and ENCOURAGED - just don't spam low quality clickbait.
- News: for news about React and major React ecosystem libraries.
- Discussion: for discussing React events, tooling, job market, project architecture, UI libraries, etc.
- Code Review Request: requests for constructive code review
- Meta: for posts about /r/reactjs itself

There are some mod-only flairs, which we assign to highlight and manually curate for posterity.

For instructions on filtering flairs on your various Reddit apps, check out the /r/Python wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/wiki/filters#wiki_desktop

This is a new policy and we welcome feedback as we adjust based on real usage. You are also welcome to message me if you are confused about what to flair things and I can help you manually.
## [3][What should I be comfortable with in React before applying to Jr dev positions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f1js4s/what_should_i_be_comfortable_with_in_react_before/)

I‚Äôm two or three months into learning React and I‚Äôm getting pretty comfortable with some aspects of it. I can set up Redux and invent reducers without referencing documentation. Same for the Router. Now I‚Äôm wondering, what else should I be comfortable with before I can say I‚Äôve covered all the ‚Äústandard‚Äù parts of React?

I‚Äôm thinking the Context API should be in there, as well as hooks. But I‚Äôm new so maybe I don‚Äôt know what is standard use for a React developer. 

Thoughts, fellow React lovers?

Hi,

I just started to learn Reactjs and after taking few lessons now in my head theres a big mess. I think I read alot of outdated contents and videos. Now im basically struggling where to go and how to continue. Even the react itself includes tutorials with class components but in some point they ve mention about why they introduced hooks and things. I just looked at the class components and there are lot to cover like lifecycle etc etc. 

So my main problem is as a new learner do i need to study about class component anymore like lifecycle and all those stuffs or should I skip class component and continue with functional components since it now supports the features that were in class components? I asked from a friend and his opinion was we still need class components and its the only way to perform few things but I wasnt happy with that answer bcz of introducing hooks they says anything can now perform with functional components as well.

How can I practice these things or where can I cover these things properly in a line? How to avoid those outdated content? If i HAVE to study class components as well plz tell me a proper way of covering topics like u should learn this and then this etc etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you :) Sorry about my english as itsnt my native language

I‚Äôm new to react and would like to ask how do I use the updated state of a value and pass it down to another function with an equation? 

e.g 

const [mass,setMass] = useState(0)
const [vol,setVol] = useState(0)
function Sum(mass, vol) {
     return mass + vol }

return(
  &amp;lt;div class and=‚ÄúApp‚Äù&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;input onChange={e =&amp;gt; setMass(e.target.value)} /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Mass: {mass} &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div class and=‚ÄúApp‚Äù&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;input onChange={e =&amp;gt; setVol(e.target.value)} /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Volume: {vol} &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Sum: {sum} &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
)

May i know ask how do I create an onSubmit button to store the updated states of setMass and setVol and what am i doing wrong here?

I have a small application where I can send some data to a node.js server. The server then uses that data to run a command to get some values in return. How can I then use those values in react?

To better understand:

application uses http GET (opens a browser window) like:  localhost:3000/info?hostName=XXXXX

Node.js server gets the hostname and runs a powershell-command using the hostname.

How can I display the info from the node.js server in the opened windows using react?
