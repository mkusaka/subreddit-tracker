I've seen people arguing on stack overflow on the right way to to this. Some say  implement a click listener in onbindviewholder, other say create your own custom interface. I've come to you guys to ask how do you go about creating your click listeners?

Hi guys üëã, for the past 7 months i have been working tirelessly to bring my startup idea to life.

**AppBoost** is an ad-network that is developed to help developers promote their apps for free. It is very easy to use, with less than 7 lines of code, developers can boost traffic to their apps and monitor the statistics. The sdk is currently available for android apps developed using Java. My plan is to see if their is market for such a tool, then develop it for other platforms and languages too.

**Appboost** drives traffic to apps through cross-promotion. Each developer that implements the sdk in his/her app gets their app promoted inside other developers apps and vice-versa.¬†

**It is still in a super rough beta state. I have been busy with another project recently, but now am fully invested in AppBoost, and am interested in understanding if this tool is actually helpful and what direction I should take it in. I only want to create something if people really love it.**

The app stores are getting more and more saturated and competitive with thousands of apps being published everyday, Developers and Businesses with little to no budgets are finding it difficult to sustain their app businesses.

**AppBoost** Aims to solve this problem by helping developers and businesses drive traffic to their apps and thereby increase their revenues.¬†

We aim to create a community of developers helping each other succeed in these tough times.

Would love to hear your feedback.

Thanks for reading this üôè

## [6][What happened to the "Stylized" tag on google play?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hvsp5f/what_happened_to_the_stylized_tag_on_google_play/)

I can find hundreds of games using the "Stylized" tag, such as Viridi, Alto's Odyssey, Fishing Life, etc.  
Yet I can't seem to be able to add it through the Tag manager on my Google Play Console. Same goes for "Offline", "Single player". I quite literally cannot find as little as two tags that will do my game justice in that list.  It's basically useless to me.  


Any idea why that is or if there's any solution to this problem?
## [7][Double the review process, half of the fun (beta channel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hvqxeo/double_the_review_process_half_of_the_fun_beta/)

For a while now, the review process on the Play store has been slower, and we are greeted on the console with the following message: "We're experiencing longer than usual review times"

Because of the current context, that is totally fair.

But what I have seen as well is that if you are using the beta channel to publish your app, then your app gets reviewed twice: once when you create your beta release, and once when you promote your beta build to prod.

Is it a new development or has it always been the case?

Hi Everyone,

Recently, Google Play updated its policy regarding the ads. As per https://youtu.be/d0bN5JYuowY?t=433 , there is a time restriction on a few kinds of ads. 

Is this time restriction affects the interstitial video ads?

## [10][Entry level positions during COVID-19?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hvi8yr/entry_level_positions_during_covid19/)

Hi everyone. Any insight is much appreciated!

I‚Äôve been practicing and applying for entry level Android Developer positions on/off for about two and a half years without any offers, and as tortuous as it has been, I‚Äôve been continuing to practice, make apps, and Leetcode as often as I can.

I was furloughed from my service job at the beginning of the COVID shut down, and it has given me a lot of time I would not otherwise have to code. Now, I‚Äôm applying to jobs, practicing Leetcode, and working on my new project at all waking hours.

However, I‚Äôve been told by a few companies (some FAANG) that they currently have a freeze on hiring entry level positions. I already have had difficulty locating junior positions, and am very unwillingly preparing myself to go back into my restaurant service job any day now. I‚Äôve also been reaching out to recruiters and companies that don‚Äôt necessarily have listed open positions.

Can anyone within the industry give me any insight and/or advice on how to navigate entry level positions during this time? I‚Äôm also slightly restricted to the West Coast for my son, which I understand doesn‚Äôt help the matter.

For reference, I do not have a CS degree. I have a Udacity Android Nanodegree, two published (albeit not well marketed) apps, and I'm at a point of desperation that I‚Äôd be willing to take any amount of pay to just get my foot in the door.

## [12][AndroidStudio - Vertical Screen Setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hvqep9/androidstudio_vertical_screen_setup/)

It's so hard to search the subject as all I get is results for Portrait mode in an Android app.

I use a dual screen setup for Android development with one of the screens rotated vertically. I usually have the Project and Logcat windows in the horizontal screen and the code in the vertical.

I was wondering if you guys have any recommendation on how to position the windows or if there's any default configuration in AndroidStudio for such setups.

Thanks!
