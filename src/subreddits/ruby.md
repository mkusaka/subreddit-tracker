## [1][So what have your thoughts been on Artichoke Ruby?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ezx6t8/so_what_have_your_thoughts_been_on_artichoke_ruby/)

I saw [Artichoke Ruby](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke) mentioned [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/clu9pd/artichoke_a_ruby_made_with_rust/) months ago and it seemed like a lot of folks were excited about this at the time. Fast forward to now, looking at the Github [commits](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/commits/master), I can see it's ***really*** moving forward, but there's still only one contributor pushing this like a bulldozer. 

Does anyone have any updated thoughts or feelings on this? Do you feel it's simply not at a viable point yet to receive contributions? Or are there other things preventing entry by other contributors? Is this worth investment?

Ultimately this seems like an interesting and possibly solid option to MRI and even the 3x3 update everyone's excited about - and perhaps can take Ruby even further. Yes/No?

Hi. I have an ongoing project which asks for many DB connections (9 total) in:

-SQL Server
-MySQL
-Oracle SQL
-PostgreSQL

I never did something like this before, so i might ask for some advices or ideas.

I'm using Rails 6.

In resume, it's a data warehouse. I must delevelop an ETL module which process all the data from these 9 databases and puts into only one DB (which is PostgreSQL). I'd like to read your experiences, advices or something like this.

So yesterday I got kinda bored so I searched up how to compile Ruby, I've got these 2 answers:

Use Rubinius, or compile it with the Ruby virtual machine and then run it, always with the vm.

Today I made it, and I am satisfied about the results; it's ~2 seconds faster at doing 4000000 iterations on my Raspberry Pi 4

The question is: can I go even deeper and get even better results?

We are in the process of breaking up our Rails monolith into microservices and moving from REST to GraphQL. Has anyone been through a process like this before that could offer me some advice? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent a good amount of time reading through [https://graphql-ruby.org/](https://graphql-ruby.org/) but I still have somewhat general questions that I am struggling to find answers to. For example, how would I restrict certain fields from being discoverable/queriable based on the role of a user? I am mainly just hoping someone can point me in the direction of some good resources to help prepare me for this transition.
## [9][At what point should I ditch codecademy (or odinproject?) for codewars?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ezkj3w/at_what_point_should_i_ditch_codecademy_or/)

I've seen a lot of people suggest you dive into projects/building stuff if you *really* want to learn programming. To my understanding, codewars is just that, you build stuff and compete with others to see who did it best. I can't decide between codecademy or odinproject or whether I can use them both, although I don't want to waste time where it isn't needed. I learn lightning fast when I learn hands on. So at what point can I just put down the basics (strings, objects, vectors etc) and pick up ruby code as needed? What would you do?

 Why is this returning true, false, true, truedef is\_valid\_name(str)  
 names = str.split(" ")  
  valid = \[\]  
  if names.length &lt; 2  
return "false"  
  end  
names.each do |name\_part|  
if name\_part\[0\].upcase  
return "true"  
elsif name\_part\[1..-1\].upcase  
return "false"      end    endend  
puts is\_valid\_name("Kush Patel")       # =&gt; true  
puts is\_valid\_name("Daniel")           # =&gt; false  
puts is\_valid\_name("Robert Downey Jr") # =&gt; true  
puts is\_valid\_name("ROBERT DOWNEY JR") # =&gt; false
