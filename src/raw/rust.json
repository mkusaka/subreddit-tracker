My friend told me about Rust a bit ago. I had always wanted to learn C++ as I've always had a big performance bias, but was always afraid of the complexity (and not being smart enough for it). So it sat on the backburner for a while, but then I kept seeing Rust posted on Hacker News (Baader Meinhof effect?) and it always being the #1 most loved language on the Stackoverflow Developer survey. The TechEmpower benchmarks pushed me over the edge, so then I devoured Steve and Carol's `The Rust Programming Language`.\n\nTo solidify my knowledge I was looking for a project to make and was re-reading Paul Graham's essays at the same time and he mentioned to make something that you yourself would want. I then also remembered a desire I had a while back to be able to find likeminded people around me (for example, someone who also likes Rust!). So I decided to build that as my project.\n\nThe core idea is that instead of swiping on people, you instead swipe on concepts and ideas (example: `hunting, vaccines, Christianity, cities, podcasts, etc.`) where swiping right means you like it / identify with it, and left is the converse.\n\nThe further you swipe in either direction, the stronger your vote. It then uses the Manhattan distance formula to compute your similarity to others. You can also view statistics like how often a concept is liked or disliked (or neutral), how long on average it takes for people to decide, how that card correlates with other cards (for example, Military and Fracking are highly correlated with one another).\n\nYou can then also view clusters of cards on profile pages. These are cards that are found to be clustered together in that their votes are highly correlated with one another. You can see how you and others align to these clusters. It's also a bit of a privacy feature as well as you cannot see how people vote on individual cards, only how they align to clusters. So their cluster alignment somewhat \"masks\" their individual card votes, or at least provides some plausible deniability. It's also just interesting to find out what groups of cards tend to cluster around each other.\n\nCurrently the clustering algorithm is a bit ad-hoc as math is _definitely_ not my strong suit. There are around 250 cards at the moment and originally I wanted to have an exact algorithm for computing similarity that also took into account weights, but I couldn't quite figure out how to have that while also allowing people to sort by similarity quickly at scale.\n\nI found out that it's basically the K-Nearest-Neighbors problem with 250 dimensions and that is a bit tricky (for me at least). So instead I wrote a small algorithm ([which might be able to be replaced with this Rust crate?](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dx2k2q/hilbert_curve_transformation_crate_for/)) to create clusters of cards, and then used the [Postgres CUBE data structure](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/cube.html) to be able to calculate and index someone's alignment in what is now 25-dimensional space (which is much more tractable than 250 dimensional space!)\n\nSo, on to the tech stack!\n\nMy only two frontend dependencies are React and axios (I'll probably refactor out axios soon). I'm a bit afraid of npm and I like limiting my dependencies. Also, small bundle sizes are great!\n\nThe backend is more interesting. I'm using `rand`, `bcrypt`, `serde`, `rusoto`, `oauth2`, `reqwest`, `time`, `rocket` (async branch), `tokio`, `tokio-postgres`, `futures`, `deadpool`, `deunicode`, `pin-project-lite`, and `async-stream`.\n\nI'm then using nginx as a reverse proxy to my Rocket server, and have the server itself currently hosted on EC2 behind CloudFront, with assets on S3.\n\nWhen I had started the project, async await wasn't quite ready yet, and future combinators were killing me with borrowing errors. Eventually I found out about the async Rocket branch, and Jeb Rosen and Sergio were always _extremely_ accommodating and helpful with all of my newb questions. I also really liked the Rocket syntax so I decided to rewrite it in Rocket!\n\nI was able to get rid of so many clones and lines of code and started feeling really good about the code-base. It was just really clean and elegant. I'm also now confident about the code, which is great. There were so many times when the compiler would refuse to compile and then I'd go, \"oh, right, yeah. good catch.\" I still have some residual PTSD from my last node server which would randomly crash with null reference exceptions due to me missing an edge case.\n\nThe only issue was that database access was still synchronous, but recently /u/bikeshedder wrote the amazing `deadpool` library, which I was able to seamlessly integrate and immediately significantly improve my runtime performance. [I wrote about that here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/e9n6mx/creating_and_using_a_postgres_database_pool_is/?st=k5ok81ng&amp;sh=440f06b6).\n\nLastly, I'd just like to [re-emphasize](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ereh5h/the_thank_you_thread/ff4f5z2/?st=k5okcaom&amp;sh=8b98f398) my thanking of the Rust community. I truly have not yet had a single bad interaction with anyone. The #beginners discord channel, everyone in IRC, Gitter, Riot, Reddit, etc. have all been extremely welcoming and helpful to a noob like me, and thanks to them I was able to finish this project.\n\nIf you'd like to check it out, here's the site: https://www.kardius.com I tried to make as many features available as possible without logging in, so no pressure to create an account at all.

I truly have not yet had a single bad interaction with anyone. The #beginners discord channel, everyone in IRC, Gitter, Riot, Reddit, etc. have all been extremely welcoming and helpful to a noob like me, and thanks to them I was able to finish this project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to check it out, here&amp;#39;s the site: &lt;a href=\"https://www.kardius.com\"&gt;https://www.kardius.com&lt;/a&gt; I tried to make as many features available as possible without logging in, so no pressure to create an account at all. You should be able to view the cards on the &lt;em&gt;Swipe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cards&lt;/em&gt; page. I doubt it&amp;#39;s good enough yet, but hopefully I can make it better! If you have any suggestions or feedback I&amp;#39;d love to hear it. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false,
