We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey there, fellow r/reactjs lurkers and devs!

I made this neat little Resume Builder project, completely free and open-source for anyone to use. It is a minimalistic and straightforward resume builder that focuses on clean design, user data privacy, quick ease of use, and easy resume updates. If you are someone who cares about any of these issues, this might be of help to you!

Check it out here: [https://rx-resume.web.app/](https://rx-resume.web.app/)

Here's a demo video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OM0LEPzDO8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OM0LEPzDO8)

I am thinking of starting working on a project but I am confused to choose between create-react-app or nextJS?Previously, I only have experience with Create-react-app and NodeJS API (without any server-side rendering). I need server-side rendering in my application But couldn't able to understand how I would structure my API and Front-End together.

It is the same playground you can use in the graphql documentation website and in hasura docs site but packaged as a react component

It supports autocompletion and automatically queries to the remote graphql schema

I've been on the hook train since it went into production last year. But for the life of me I don't ever think of using useReducer/useCallback/useMemo over the core 3. I feel like I understand what they are used for, but Id on't know when to actually apply them. I've read articles on it and I still don't get it. So I'm hoping I can find someone here that can finally tick that switch for me.
