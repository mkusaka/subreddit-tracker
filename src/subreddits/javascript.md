## [3][[AskJS] Can Anyone Recommend an Async Iteration Library That Mirrors Javascript?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/jd3lg2/askjs_can_anyone_recommend_an_async_iteration/)

With the `async`/`await` keywords you are technically returning promises from your function, and this works poorly when you want to (for instance) `reduce` an array with an asynchronous callback.

I assumed that (with `async`/`await` being old news at this point) I'd easily be able to find a library that lets me `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc. with `async` functions ... but I was surprised to find there wasn't!  Or at least, not with the normal Javascript signatures.

For instance, async.js seems to be the 800 lbs. gorilla in the space, but it makes up its own signature for `reduce` (it takes the initial value *before* the callback, instead of after).  The last thing I want to do is learn a whole second set of signatures for all of my array iteration methods ... and then start mixing up the `async` and non-`async` versions of those methods.

So, I came here to ask how others have solved this problem.  Do you just hold your nose and use async.js (memorizing two different ways to do the same thing for no reason)?  Do you use some other library I missed?  Do you write your own `reduceAsync`?

Surely people *are* using `reduce` with asynchronous functions?
