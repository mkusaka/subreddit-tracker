Weâ€™re on the engineering team for Android Jetpack &amp; Jetpack Compose, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, August 27**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), focusing on a new topic every week. Weâ€™re excited to close out our [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid) with a focus on UI, and on Thursday weâ€™ll be hosting an AMA on the Android Jetpack and Jetpack Compose!

[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is our suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We launched several new libraries like Hilt for Dependency Injection, App Startup, and updates to Paging, Navigation, CameraX, and more.  Check out the Jetpack updates we made during #11WeeksOfAndroid [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-jetpack.html).

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI - declarative, composable, and more! We just [launched](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/announcing-jetpack-compose-alpha.html) alpha, together with a bunch of new  training materials! Check out our new videos, or dive into our curated [pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose). We are excited to hear your feedback as you try it!

For this AMA, we want to answer your *technical* questions about Android Jetpack and Compose.  No roadmaps :)

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, August 27 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PDT / 4:20 PM EDT.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

## [4][Showkase: An auto-generated Jetpack Compose component browser by Airbnb](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iib69w/showkase_an_autogenerated_jetpack_compose/)

Hey everyone!

I am thrilled to introduce Airbnb's latest open source project -

ðŸ”¦ [Showkase](https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase) ðŸ”¦

Showkase is an annotation processor based Android library that helps you organize, discover, search and visualize Jetpack Compose UI elements. It auto-generates a UI browser app for you âœ¨

https://preview.redd.it/21aff909wrj51.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fde7f97d79db4ce05420499a77796498f20b4a3b

Showkase eliminates the manual work of maintaining a UI preview/browser app that each company is forced to build in order to maintain their design systems. By just adding a few annotations to your UI elements, this is what you get for free ðŸ‘‡

[Showkase in action](https://reddit.com/link/iib69w/video/a9fq4d9ewrj51/player)

It currently supports Jetpack Compose composables, colors and typography but you should expect support for more UI elements! You can also easily search and find the right elements that someone else on your team might've built. This helps in maintaining consistency across your app!

[Showkase allows you to visualize composables, colors &amp; typography](https://preview.redd.it/t73nzw9gwrj51.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e35a295f45bc5d9aeaf9db4415c5849c8f008841)

But that's not all! Showkase also auto-generates permutations of your composables and renders it in common situations like RTL, Dark Mode, Font Scaling, etc. This helps in catching issues early and gives you early signals while you are still developing your components.

What do I need to do to see my Compose UI elements in this app?

Glad you asked! Showkase provides annotations that you need to add to your UI elements and that's mostly it ðŸ’¥

Setup instructions here - [https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase#installation](https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase#installation)

We are thinking about some interesting ways in which we can extend this! We'd love to hear more about other creative ways to improve it! I hope that you find Showkase useful as you start experimenting with Compose. This has been in the works since April so I'm very excited to finally launch it! Give it a shot and let me know what you think!

## [5][Replacement of Android Drawable Importer plugin in Android Studio?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iirk7d/replacement_of_android_drawable_importer_plugin/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iirk7d/replacement_of_android_drawable_importer_plugin/

From Android Studio 3.6 I know that it's not possible to use Android Drawable Importer plugin anymore by default. I managed to download it from Github and could use it properly, but does anyone know any replacement?

I have tried Import Drawables in Resource Manager but it does not seem to render multiple densities for different screen sizes (or I don't know how to do it properly). 

Thank you!

Hi,

I am building [a service](http://revenual.com/) that tackles these painpoints I am having as a developer living in Europe:

\- How to monitor revenues from across different apps and different stores?

\- When doing taxes declaration, how to generate a report with your net-income to declare from app sales and IAP?

Do you share these paintpoints? how do you solve them?
## [7][Question about passing object between fragments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iinx9c/question_about_passing_object_between_fragments/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iinx9c/question_about_passing_object_between_fragments/

Hello everyone,

The android app I'm developing has 2 activities and several fragments:

1. Login (talks to API and gets access token)
2. Main (6 fragments currently, will increase in future.)

*Trying to follow MVVM.*

In login, logics are set up and corresponding new user object(from User model) is created on successful login.

How should this user object be accessed from (passed to) Main and its fragments? Currently,  it is passed form Login to Main through **Intent.** For fragments in main: Home fragment gets it from intent and sister fragments gets it through **Navigation bundle** passed among them.

Is there a better way to do it?

Thank you.

&gt;If you are likely publishing your app to Google Play. It is recommended not to use any other payment method other than their official one. There is a high chance your app might get banned.

I was using this payment mode in some of my apps that I don't want to be on Google Play, hence decided to create a separate module for it.

Also, the [official](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK) one is no longer maintained, besides it had certain issues that this library solves like returning `purchase details` (currently only supports single payments).

I've seen some custom lock screen floating around and was wondering;

* If there any source code/tutorial that I could follow.
* How far can you customize it? Could you add a really complex interaction, e.g.  You need to finish a mini-game first before the screen unlocks?
* Is it future proof?
## [11][Banning a whole country because of bad reviews ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iiqhqx/banning_a_whole_country_because_of_bad_reviews/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iiqhqx/banning_a_whole_country_because_of_bad_reviews/

I get way lower than average reviews from Indian users and it is somewhat tanking my global rating. It is the second country in term of rating count (10%). I do not know exactly why India ratings are so low but probably (among other things) the fact that the app is not translated, which I have no plan to do. This is also a fairly technical app and my guess many people there do not understand how to use it.

I'm seriously considering disabling the whole country in the Play Store console. What makes me hesitate is that it will affect download counts, with possible undesired side effects.

Thoughts ?
