Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

I've been running this benchmark to try and catch regressions in either my code or rustc versions. The latest version is always here:

http://chimper.org/rawloader-rustc-benchmarks/

The general trend is quite good. Over these two and a half years of rust versions the improvements are:

- 31% faster compile time
- 23% smaller binary size
- 9% faster runtime

Great work by the rust team, thanks!

There have also been a few regressions over time and recently I've noticed three:

- The current beta has a 14% increase in compile time which seems mostly fixed in nightly. Something similar happened in 1.31 and 1.32 with a 11% increase followed by a 15% decrease that more than made up for it.
- 1.36 introduced a 29% increase in binary size that was never recovered.
- There is one specific file that has had a ~5-15% runtime regression ever since 1.21 for which I should probably try and isolate a test case.

I'm particularly curious if anyone knows what the binary size increase was due to.

Hey, everyone! I just published a new version of std.rs which has built-in search now (the top rated request from the last thread). That means you can now do all of the following redirects:

| From                       | To                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://std.rs`           | `https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/`                 |
| `https://n.std.rs`         | `https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/`                |
| `https://std.rs/n`         | `https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/`                |

| `https://std.rs/n/println` | `https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/?search=println` |

This new version is built on CloudFlare workers, so if there are any other redirects which may be helpful, feel free to open a pull request or issue! The source code is available here: https://github.com/knpwrs/std.rs

[Synchrony](https://github.com/Protryon/synchrony) is a project I threw together over the weekend that is designed to be a partial drop-in replacement for Sidekiq (a similar ruby project), and a general job execution/scheduler tool that scales horizontally.

It uses Redis by default, but is designed to be able to use different store types. It has a fully implemented &amp; tested HTTP API powered by Iron.

This is my first large-ish Rust project, so any feedback &amp; criticism is appreciated!

For any interested, it uses:

\- actix-web

\- juniper

\- dataloader-rs

&amp;#x200B;

Would love any feedback, and happy to discuss :)

[https://github.com/jayy-lmao/rust-graphql-docker](https://github.com/jayy-lmao/rust-graphql-docker)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Oooh and it uses a minimal docker container, see references for details ;)
