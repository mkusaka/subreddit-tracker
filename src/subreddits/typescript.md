I've seen the docs and have played around with TS in toy projects, in an attempt to add it to my repertoire. I come from a background where my projects didn't use TS at all. How does one develop an intuitive sense of using TS for production?

While I realize the significance, I find it hard to bridge the gap between my amateur knowledge and being production-ready as the rest of my skillset.

I keep having to double-check what to type something while I'm implementing, sometimes resorting to online searches especially for imported libraries. There's also the pain of not knowing for sure if I typed it the right way. Is it normal for it to be time-consuming at the start?

I am totally new to typescript i just wanted to do some side project to learn a bit more of it with vue. But i cant even configure my first app i am having problems with vue imports. I have made shim.d.ts but nothing is fixing the import error on "import App from './App.vue'" ....

Is there any straightforward tutorial how to set up my vue app with typescript , or if anyone could give me suggestion how to fix this and avoid these kind of errors in future id be really thankful.

Hi,

I have some custom types like

    type MyType = {
        id: number;
        title: string;
        checked: boolean;
    }

I am trying to make a generic type (if possible) that will convert any boolean property in the type to binary (0|1).

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of something like the following

    type BoToBiFormat = {[x:string]:any}
    type BoolToBinary&lt;T extends BoToBiFormat&gt; = {
        [x in keyof T]: T[x] === boolean ? 0|1 : T[x];
    }

but that obviously didn't work. Is there a way to make such a type?

Hello, I'm currently writing a little Axios-like wrapper around the Fetch API for the size benefits. To do this, I enlist a higher order function that differentiates body-less methods like GET, DELETE, OPTIONS, etc. from POST, PUT, etc. 

Here's my code (roughly)


```
type BodylessMethods = 'get' | 'delete' | 'options' | 'head';
type BodyMethods = 'post' | 'put' | 'patch';
const isOfBodylessMethod = (method: string): method is BodylessMethods =&gt; ['get', 'delete', 'options', 'head'].includes(method);

...

private request = (method: BodyMethods | BodylessMethods) =&gt; {
  return isOfBodylessMethod(method)
    ? (resource: string, params?: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;) =&gt; {
        ...
      }
    : (resource: string, data?: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;, params?: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;) =&gt; {
        ...
      };
};

public get = this.request('get');
```

The problem I'm running into is that, for some reason the bodyless methods (`.get()`, `.delete()`, etc) throw an error if I make `data` a non-optional parameter in that second function, and I don't quite know why. I'm given `TS2554: Expected 2-3 arguments, but got 1.` Why would 2 arguments be expected? The first function has 1 required, 1 optional, the second 2 required and 1 optional. Surely 1-3 arguments should be expected?

Now, this can easily be fixed by keeping `data` optional, and should likely be solved that way as the spec doesn't require a body with POST, PUT, etc., but I'd like to know why this issue is popping up. I don't understand where it is coming from.

I have a function that accepts a class object. If I pass a json inside, typescript seems to automatically cast the json object into the object declared in the parameter. Is this reliable? Or should I map it and pass it in?

Something like 75% of all errors are TypeErrors and all my portfolio items showcase mid level Typescript even though by experience I'm a junior. It's the one technology I feel strongly about because in the JS days I spent 30% of my time building the project, 70% of the time figuring out where the interpreter's dynamic type inference is throwing an error.

Do JS only companies take offense if you start raving about how much TS has reinforced your code and sense of clarity on what is being returned where? Should I downplay it if I know they're not big on TS? 

Intuition says yes especially given my lack of corporate experience (3 years learning/practicing at home though). PS: I know the best answer is to find a company that has TS but in these times I can't be picky.
