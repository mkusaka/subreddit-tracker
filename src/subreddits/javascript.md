*(excuse my english french guy)

**A)** When you know you're a senior Javascript developer ?
 
 
**B)** Is it possible to be "senior" without being Full Stack for example being just Frontend or just Backend or for the old programmer being full stack really mean being senior and understanding the whole picture better ?
 
 
**C)** Why many Java and C# programmer dislike and avoid Javascript a lot ? are they stuck with their old mentalities and are afraid to learn new things or ? Keep reading on others thread that WebAssembly will be "the thing" etc
 
 
**D)** Does the industry standardized on VSCode or the alternative IDE are just as good ? is it possible today in 2020 to completly disable the Telemetry in VSCode ?


**E)** Does anyone have experience here working 100% remote as a JS dev in the USA but living in Canada ? Work permit, currency conversion, taxes etc etc all that jazz

Thank you very much for your time
