Hi,

I used svgo/svgr to transform popular svg icons sets so it can be  copy/pasted as React components. Hope you find this useful.

The code https://imgur.com/gallery/egrmRf2
I don't understand why the variable "text" becomes only one character at a time like
text =
''
's'
'o'
'm'
'e'
' '
't'
'e'
'x'
't'
And I want it to join all of the letters together and it's basically the exact example that has been shown on React's page about useState but in string instead of numbers

I have difficulties with figuring out how the file structure should be in a project. I mean the components.
Currently I'm going to do a project which has 4 panels for 4 user roles.

If anyone can tell me a way to manage the file structure that would be much appreciated.
Thank you üòä

\- The states of the range sliders used for answering the questions should be maintained throughout the life of the code (unless submitted)

&amp;#x200B;

\- A progess bar is to be shown which is divided by 3 Pages where on first page it should be on 33% with colour Red , 66% with colour Blue , 100% with colour Green (Done with this thing)

I'm currently developing a personal project that has grown quite a bit over the past months, using React + Django REST. Now, here's how I write React: if a component needs state, I make it a class, if it's a simple widget, I make it a function, and that's it. I'm feeling kinda guilty for not using any of the "advanced" features. No HOCs, no hooks, no context or Redux or whatever, and so far everything works great, even though the complexity has increased quite a bit. Anyone else experiencing the same feeling?

Hi community!

I try to figure out how to run logic on component unmount that depends on \`useState\` variable. This unsubscribe function won't have latest \`input\` value at the time of the run, please advise on how to achieve it...

    const [input, setInput] = useState('');
    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      return function unsubscribe() {
        doSomething(input);
      }
    }, []);

I've played with react and built some solo apps, but haven't used it in a team / commercial setting yet, and am wondering the following:

What is the most common way of styling react apps at the moment, in a normal work setting? Styled components, CSS modules, standard CSS / SASS, ... ?

I'm not asking which one you prefer, or for pros and cons, but which one would you expect to find if you joined a random team working with react? Or, to put it another way, if a random dev joined your team, which one would you expect them to master, as a priority?

Thanks in advance!
