I've been working on a gem that's very much experimental, and would love some feedback. The ReadMe is not complete, but I'm hoping there's enough to get the point across. What I'd really like to find out is:

\- Is there anything out there that already satisfies these requirements but better?

\- Would you as a dev find this data structure useful?

\- Is my implementation the ideal way to go about things?

So in my current project we are using elastic to index data and in specs we are doing sleep after every import and sleep function to let the import finish, which slows the whole test suite a lot. What is the best way to have the data imported to elastic when testing queries, controllers?
