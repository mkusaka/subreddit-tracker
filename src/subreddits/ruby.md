When we do:

```
[1, 2, 3].map do |el|

I'm making a telegram bot that has commands and etc. However, I want the bot to register that a new user has joined the group and then it reply with a welcome message. I'm using ruby to code it but I don't know what to put. I would send the source code so far but I don't know how to.
