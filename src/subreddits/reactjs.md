## [9][Confused about implementing OAuth with my React front-end and NodeJS backend](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbmfc1/confused_about_implementing_oauth_with_my_react/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbmfc1/confused_about_implementing_oauth_with_my_react/
---
I am not sure if there is a gap in my knowledge, so I am going to try to explain.

I have a NodeJS backend that has an `/api/auth/google` endpoint which is configured with a Passport Strategy to send the user to the Google login screen to give my application access to their name. If they agree to login, Passport will call my `api/auth/google/callback` URL with the Google data I initially asked for. Here, I respond with a JWT signed with this user's name (and possibly add a user to my DB if they're a first time visitor). 

This is great, and in fact, I can get to this Google screen by doing something like this in React:

    &lt;a href={`${process.env.API_URL}/auth/google`}&gt;Login with Google&lt;/a&gt;

However, my issue arises when I need my client code to now receive this JWT. Since I didn't initiate a `GET` to `/api/auth/google/callback`, I have no way of getting the JWT unless I do something like `res.redirect(${process.env.CLIENT_URL}/${jwt})`, but this just seems off? Sending the JWT in the URL? I feel like this can't be right.

I found somebody else with this exact question [as seen here on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59129691/passing-oauth-user-data-back-to-react-via-node-passport-authentication), but unfortunately, it seems nobody responded.

Am I doing OAuth incorrectly, or am I not understanding the process?
## [10][delploy react + flask + nginx on docker swarm](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbrqs8/delploy_react_flask_nginx_on_docker_swarm/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbrqs8/delploy_react_flask_nginx_on_docker_swarm/

Hi, I'm on a project that i was originally doing only the backend for, a simple flask/gunicorn app with nginx reverse proxy in docker-compose container running on a docker-swarm being queried with polling. I've now inherited the frontend aswell, i don't have experience deploying react apps and am wondering whether i should deploy the react app within the same container as the backend on the swarm, or serve it on a seperate host and connect to the backend swarm? Note i'm also using sockets now instead of polling with flask-socketio.  
I would appreciate any help.
## [11][How to integrate testing two components where one of them depends on the other?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbr2st/how_to_integrate_testing_two_components_where_one/)

I have a component called BlogPosts that takes a prop of currentPage = 0 initially

Another component is called PaginationUI. when I click on a button, it changes currentPage to the next page (1)

How could I test these two components are working together with Jest and react-testing-library?

I hope I don't need to use Enzyme!
## [12][How to handle different types of errors from APIs in React](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbq5i6/how_to_handle_different_types_of_errors_from_apis/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fbq5i6/how_to_handle_different_types_of_errors_from_apis/

In React, usually to display an error message to the use you say:

`APICall.catch((e) =&gt; {`

this.setState({errorMessage: e})

`})`

What if the API updated in the future and you received an error object instead of a string. This will cause an error when displaying this error message to the user. How would you solve this problem?
