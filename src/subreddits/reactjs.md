We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Is there a way to store the response data without using a database? The reason i want to do this is to limit the amount of api calls I make. In this specific case I want to make calls to pokeapi to get  pokemon data and then store it somehow in the frontend. Then I want to use that data later on so that if a user revisits the same pokemon's page, it wont make a GET request again and instead uses the saved/cached data.

You could do the below:

    const MyComponent = (props) =&gt; {
    
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Heading Here&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    {props.stuff.map(({title})=&gt;&lt;h3&gt;title&lt;/h3&gt;)}
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        )
    }
    
    export default MyComponent

Or you could call a function instead:

    import React from 'react'
    
    const MyComponent = (props) =&gt; {
    
        const renderChildren = () =&gt; props.stuff.map(({title})=&gt;&lt;h3&gt;title&lt;/h3&gt;)
        
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Heading Here&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    {renderChildren()}
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        )
    }
    
    export default MyComponent

What is the latter called? renderFunctions? And what is their main purpose? 

For me, I use them when the map/renderChildren return is very long. So having the renderChildren() function keeps the main component more readable. But in that case I think "why not make it a brand new component"

Hi All,

I am working on a tutorial wherein I am trying to build a twitter like application with a Django backend and a React frontend. I am following the tutorial steps but trying to implement my solution with the hooks and context api.

There is one place I am stuck on. So on the home page, when say a guest user visits the website, I want to show all tweets. But on a profile page, I want to show only the tweets of a particular user. I am using react-router to pick up the username from the URL.

The problem I am facing is, on the second route i.e. the one with the username, 2 api calls are being made to the backend. One is when the tweets-context is first created and the second when the username gets set. Because of this, since both of calls are being made to the backend, whichever call gets fulfilled by the backend later, gets rendered on the screen. Ideally I would want to make the call on this route only after the username has been set.

How do I avoid these multiple calls?

Here is the link to the sandbox with my code:

 [https://codesandbox.io/s/tender-pascal-tbf0s](https://codesandbox.io/s/tender-pascal-tbf0s) 

The actual code might not run on another machine because the APIs are not hosted anywhere, they are on my local machine only. But I hope someone can identify the issue and provide a solution.

Thanks in advance!
