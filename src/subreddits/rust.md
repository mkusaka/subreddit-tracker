Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g0erq1/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Newbie here. Still working through The Book. Good stuff.

I'm interested in adding Spanish translations to Rust documentation to increase adoption of Rust.

Is this a good idea? What is the minimum Rust competency level I should achieve in order to start productively translating documentation?

I have never contributed to an open source project and my programming experience is limited to basic Python scripting, so any input would be much appreciated.

Muchas gracias, Rustacean Comrades!

Hey all, just wanted to share a little series of introductory presentations for Serde I originally wrote for the Utah Rust meetup. It doesn't go into a ton of depth, but it was a lot of fun to write, and I hope somebody finds it helpful or wants to show some of what Rust can do to others with it! There's bound to be mistakes or ways to improve the presentations, and I'd love to hear them too. Links:

After compiling my first "hello world" program, I noticed that it had massive 24mb. Then I gave cargo the --release flag, and it dropped to 4. Still, why are these binaries this big? I would expect a few kb for the same program in C.
Am I missing something?

Hello, right now I have a actix Web 1.0 running in production but I will refactor it to something newer. But because the refactoring is maybe too dramatic changing the framework would be about the same work.

So thats why I come here to ask you guys, should I upgrade to actix Web 2.0 or change to warp instead ?
