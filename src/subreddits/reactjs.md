I am comfortable in building applications with React.js, hooks, and redux as well but I want to dive deep into react to become good developer. I have good knowledge how JavaScript works under the hood, and everything related to JavaScript like closures, hoisting, prototypal inheritance,etc. So can someone suggest some resources to learn React.js also upto that level?

Hi all,

is there some good resource online on how to create a clean and modern folder structure for a react app? Would be nice if there'd be some thoughts on why the folders are laid out as they are, not just a list of folders itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

## [11][Cypress test error when importing from CRA + TS source code](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fervz7/cypress_test_error_when_importing_from_cra_ts/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fervz7/cypress_test_error_when_importing_from_cra_ts/
---
One of my Cypress tests fails to run when it tries to import from a file in the source code (CRA src directory).

The test:

    // cypress/integration/this-fails.js
    import { MY_CONSTANT } from '../../src/constants';
    
    describe('Cypress', () =&gt; {
      ...
    })

The source file:

    // src/constants.ts
    export const MY_CONSTANT = 'foo';

The Cypress test failure is caused by a Jest test file in the source directory:

    ERROR in /my-app/src/App.test.tsx(5,1)
    
    Cannot find name 'test'. Do you need to install type definitions for a test runner? Try`npm i @types/jest`or`npm i @types/mocha`.

The Jest type definitions are installed. Additionally, to no avail, I have tried to exclude the problematic Jest test in the Cypress tsconfig.

    // cypress/tsconfig.json
    {
      ...
      "exclude": [
        "../src/App.test.tsx"
      ],
      ...
    }

Solving JS build/bundling config problems is not my strongest area, so if someone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.

Here is a minimal repo that reproduces my problem: [https://github.com/brietsparks/cra-ts-cypress-troubleshooting](https://github.com/brietsparks/cra-ts-cypress-troubleshooting)

Lastly, to clarify why I am importing things into Cypress tests from the source directory ‚Äî the imported variable is intended to be a DOM selector or a function that returns a DOM selector so that selectors are not hardcoded in the tests.
