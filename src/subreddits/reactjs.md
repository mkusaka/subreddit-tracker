We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Project URL: [https://mealternative.com/](https://mealternative.com/).

Hello everyone! First time posting, if I violate any rules please let me know and I'll change it up.

I would like to share my first react project (first as in not following any tutorial, original concept and project). any suggestions would also be great to hear. 

The website is not for production but rather an example website. It demonstrates the MERN stack implementation, redux, redux-saga, material UI, react-google map integration and much more. I've built this project initially because I want to build a restaurant finder for my personal use. I then realize this might be a good project for me to also implement the MERN stack for some MERN knowledge revision (well, it took way longer than I expected).

I've documented the complete google map integration inside the project Frontend GitHub [repo](https://github.com/kazhala/mealternative), including setting up google map token, address auto-complete and restaurant searching. The repo also contains instructions and Cloudformation templates about how this entire MERN stack project is hosted on AWS. It also explains how the folder structures are set up for easy navigation and understanding. I've also documented some of the backend implementation details in the project Backend Github [repo](https://github.com/kazhala/mealternative-backend).

Some of the implementations might not be best practice and I would like to hear feedback to improve it. Thanks, everyone.

Like really, it's a wonderful lib. It makes animations great and sometimes even magical.

If you don't believe me, check this out: [https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-animatesharedlayout-menu-underline-demo-zxsmv?file=/src/App.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-animatesharedlayout-menu-underline-demo-zxsmv?file=/src/App.js)

I love this lib, for me it could easily become the de facto go-to animation lib on react, hands down.

Hey champs, currently developing a ReactJS project with thunk, redux.. bangs and gold cupcakes. I'm having a slight misunderstanding - heres the rundown.

&amp;#x200B;

Im creating an ecommerce website that has bookings etc. Each user has a page that displays a list of  their bookings for items, which includes data from different  database tables - item, user etc. This is all presented within the list item, what is the best practice for retrieving the data? a chained action in redux using thunk that gets the users bookings, then accesses the item db to get the item info? Bit lost in my own head lol, just wondering how others would do such a task. Keep in mind this happens all throughout the app so trying to make the functions decoupled if you will.

Bit of a shit explanation, let me know if you need more info..

Cheers

Hey I've been trying to get axios to work for like 2 hours, and I finally found a solution which works, but I don't understand why my initial code didn't work, so if anyone could tell me what I was doing wrong here?

Here' my code: 

		axios({
			url: "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token",
			method: "POST",
			params: {
				grant_type: "client_credentials",
			},
			headers: {
				Accept: "application/json",
				"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
			},
			auth: {
				username: "private",
				password: "private",
			},
		}).then((res) =&gt; console.log(res));

Here's the code that I found online that actually works: 

		axios
			.post("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token", null, {
				params: {
					grant_type: "client_credentials",
				},
				headers: {
					Accept: "application/json",
					"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
				},
				auth: {
					username: "private",
					password: "private",
				},
			})
			.then((res) =&gt; console.log(res));

When using my code, the server was just giving me a "server_error" response and nothing else...
