Hello

I've just made my first gem! It's a wrapper for an instant search engine API (MeiliSearch). It means indexes, documents, and search handling.  
[https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-ruby](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-ruby)

I love ruby language, it's literally my favorite one, but I use it more with Rails than in this kind of situation.

So, I need your feedback to correct and improve it!

Thanks for your time.

And for the curious ones, here is the repository of our search engine MeiliSearch. We are open-source and we really need your support! ‚≠êÔ∏è Each star and feedback are important for us üôÇ[https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)

Hello everyone, I hope you are well. I'm not sure if it's the best place for such announcements but I was sharing with you my articles for the past 2 years so I decided to write here as I appreciate this community and the value it gives.

I have just finished one of my projects and have more free time now. I thought that I may work with programmers that have fewer experience than me to help them improve the quality of their code or careers as Ruby developers. Does anyone need a consultation, code review or advice? It will be free, maybe in the future, I will think about some kind of compensation in case of a longer partnership but for now, I just wanted to check if there is anyone interested that I could share my knowledge and experience with and see what type of problems do you have.

Short about me:

I ran into a BigDecimal value which has confused the heck out of me.  This is on Ruby 2.6.3

    2.6.3 :007 &gt; BigDecimal("0.08442931")
     =&gt; 0.8442931e-1
    2.6.3 :008 &gt; BigDecimal("0.08442931") - 0.8442931e-1
     =&gt; 0.1e-16

Take note I copied the value from the first line and pasted it to the second.  I otherwise get

    2.6.3 :002 &gt;  BigDecimal("0.08442931") -  BigDecimal("0.08442931")
     =&gt; 0.0

What is going on here?  It doesn't happen often with other values, for example if I change the last digit

    2.6.3 :004 &gt;  BigDecimal("0.08442932") - 0.8442932e-1
     =&gt; 0.0

Any idea what's happening?

Hey guys, I've launched a new Ruby build on YouTube. This is a pretty interesting one as it involves a lot of interaction with the user and handling the user's input from the Terminal. Guess the wrong letter too many times and it's game over. Was a lot of fun writing this code for the video, hopefully it's useful to anyone getting into Ruby.

As always, I'm planning to post some more Ruby content to my channel to promote the Ruby language, so would be open to suggestions about content ideas. Thanks :)

I want to be able to run an method, and while it runs run another method not waiting for the first to end/exit. It can easily be done in JS with stuff like promises but I couldn't figure out something similar for ruby.

Something like:

    def method
        some_method_that_doesnt_end
        other_method
    end

&amp;#x200B;

While `some_method_that_doesnt_end` can run indefinitely, I want to run several of those at the same time.

## [10][www.viky.ai a Natural Language Processing platform (Ruby On Rails app + C NLP component)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/eojgtk/wwwvikyai_a_natural_language_processing_platform/)

Hi,

[viky.ai](https://www.viky.ai/) is a **Natural Language Processing platform**. It allows you to **extract information from unstructured text contents**.

The technical component *nlp*, written in C, allows the extraction of structured information, this extraction is defined within agents. The agents are multilingual assistants to find relevant data. The *nlp* component takes as input a set of agents in JSON format and unstructured textual content in order to provide a JSON stream of structured data as output.

The second technical component webapp is a **Rails application** that allows you to work collaboratively to set up agents by offering dedicated interfaces. It also provides the interpret API in order to allow integration into a third-party system.

**viky.ai** **is released under open-source license** (MIT), code is available on [Github](https://github.com/viky-ai/viky-ai).
