On the GitHub the last commit was almost 2 years ago, does it work well?
Also does it work fine with both pg and pg-promise?

So I'm trying to have a counter that's like Day: n for how many times the loop runs. So it would be like starting at day 0 and every time it goes through the loop just add one day. I've declared and initialized all my variables I'm dealing with. The code for my loop is: 

while (isHarvestTime === false &amp;&amp; alive === true) {  
 print("Day: " + day);  
}

&amp;#x200B;

All I'm getting as output is a blank screen so I'm not really sure how to get the day counter to print.

Type inference has always stumped me, forcing me to use explicit types / generics. I finally figured it out!

If there are any experts on how typescript's \`infer\` keyword works, I think it could make for a super useful Medium article.

I was wondering if anyone happens to know if what I am trying to achieve is even possible.

What I have in regular Javascript is the following:

    let functions = {
        add: (state, x, y) =&gt; state + x + y,
        subtract: (state, x) =&gt; state - x,
        decrement: (state) =&gt; state - 1,
        increment: (state) =&gt; state + 1,
    };
    
    function wrapper(func) {
        return (...args) =&gt; func(5, ...args);
    }
    
    function wrapObject(obj) {
        const newFunctions = {};
        Object.keys(obj).map(key =&gt; {
            newFunctions[key] = wrapper(obj[key]);
        });
        return newFunctions;
    }
    
    const newFunctions = wrapObject(functions);
    
    newFunctions.add()

The idea is simple. You have an object with functions that all have state as the first argument. I want to create a new object where I return the same functions except where the state is injected. In the above example it's just the number 5 that's always injected but that's beside the point. I achieve this by simply looping over the keys and returning an object with those keys and the values wrapped in a wrapper function.

The problem with this code is that the editor doesn't know what parameters the function add (or any of them) takes. I would like to keep this intact so I figured I would use typescript.

I came up with the following:

    type Dictionary = { [key: string]: (state: number, ...args: any[]) =&gt; any }
    type StateFunction = (state: any, ...args: any[]) =&gt; any
    type OmitFirstParam&lt;T&gt; = T extends (state: number, ...args: infer P) =&gt; any ? P : never;
    type NewFunction&lt;T&gt; = T extends (state: number, ...args: infer P) =&gt; any ? (...args: P) =&gt; void :  never;
    type NewDictionary&lt;T&gt; = T extends { [key: string]: infer F } ? { [key: string]:  NewFunction&lt;F&gt;  } : never;
    
    
    let functions = {
        add: (state: number, x: number, y: number) =&gt; state + x + y,
        subtract: (state: number, x: number) =&gt; state - x,
        decrement: (state: number) =&gt; state - 1,
        increment: (state: number) =&gt; state + 1,
    };
    
    
    function wrapper&lt;T extends StateFunction&gt;(func: T): (...funcArgs: OmitFirstParam&lt;T&gt;) =&gt; void {
        return (...args) =&gt; func(5, ...args);
    }
    
    
    function wrapObject&lt;T extends { [key: string]: (state: number, ...args: any[]) =&gt; any }&gt;(obj: T): NewDictionary&lt;T&gt; {
        const newFunctions: any = {};
        Object.keys(obj).map(key =&gt; {
            newFunctions[key] = wrapper(obj[key])
        });
        return newFunctions;
    }
    
    
    const newFunctions = wrapObject(functions);
    
    newFunctions.increment();

the code in [typescriptlang playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=32&amp;ssc=26&amp;pln=1&amp;pc=1#code/C4TwDgpgBAIglgY2HA9gOwIYCcRQLxQDeUA2gNYQgBcUAzsFnGgOYC6NAFPRsBDWgFcAtgCMIWADRQAdLOzNaNDGhAlWASnwA+KMtwBfALAAoUJCgBlYDwgAxAWiSo0+KF2u8lKqbOnzFuipqmng6eiZm0ADyQnDAtnBY9AAK2BhCADwAKjoEWVAQAB68aAAmtG7cnlCCouI+clgKNEwAZuJQySFhKlAA-J1Q-BAAbuIA3BHg0AByEADu9o7I6Nm5UPlFJeWVHnw1wmKSMo3NUG0dXdqBuAMcvv40V6FQIyhwpUNQNaMTU+ZzebwJzobAgNauTbFCBlCrEciUGj0RgsdjnNDtLBQWxQfT9IikCjUOgMJhsGhQQFLEFoDK2HS4r5oX5YSbGEwmAA2EGAUFaDhpFQIhBM32+GFKpU4VX2tSOUkK-EO9SgxLl4m6JJsUAA1FBCrrVRJRWLaAIRAwMEhpXslXVjoqDvbNTKoABafXG4xiqClCAILAQIQw4A2mx2o4uvbuqAARi9PqYAaDIbD1XVWCj2r18ZM+jZHOM-OWzig8ywGDAkCw2QK0Nhlj21JWaC0HGLCBoWXUnF8HYAgk0AjE4gkksBUhXMjlNW8PkQTd9A8ABFgXPdTrRNR2OABWBp+IfqNlGdlnjstssVsBREQAK39wFrWxhO3hRKRpNRadlyuODyHLxVA0a49FxNsUHvLse0pBZgRbMEIRFb0xQQdB6B+RYBRbAIwOFfNFygW8HyQaQiVoDhILvdRpCESsOCJa5kJ9H1mSwkt0IREBWFcctK2rSj7y4jRCP0Y9COXVcXDY5tnFoE9CxMNC0AwmTsLk3jr2Ix923U9DxLPNSOJU6Qk0DYM0GADhjyAA)

It almost works. It correctly realizes that the state parameter is not needed anymore but it thinks that every function takes the same arguments namely x and y. What I think is going wrong is that typescript has to pick one function for the type `key: string]: (state: number, ...args: any[]) =&gt; any` and uses that to build the Dictionary type that I created.

I have a feeling it's not possible.

EDIT: 

Thanks to /u/Erelde I got something that works [link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=1&amp;ssc=1&amp;pln=38&amp;pc=19#code/C4TwDgpgBAysCGwIDECuA7AxsAlge3SgF4oAKAZwSQC4p50QAaKAOjfgCcBzc2+kANoBdAJTEAfHQYBuALAAoUJCgB5ALY5gyHB0oBBbgB5kkksigQAHknQATcmUqIIfBszYtOPWjnQAzCA4oAAUxIkl+KAB+Mg8vXhCwyQA3PBxbKFp0CGTAuUVwaABZeDBIW0MAFQtrCDsHACUITDwOCsoOXy5mOGc0LFwCcVMoAG8oAQBrKF8oSYgQPD8oSqFadU1tXWADLiqpoUkAX3yFABsIYCg-DGx8dAcSUYUoV7pbW1oKKhcodFQ1AAjQLMSxZAHAjjMEDgoGBJJQJxIKAAaigllRUCYLze5FQgOAHHg2C+SN+-zhUPRsMhCLJUAAtOjGDjXrZmhwIGo6sBST8afCJIifoyoABGFnyN4zLCc7noXmOfl-CGC8LC5yYiUKE4KPXyG4De5QADuRLKgSqNRs9ig-TuQ1IhswtEqYmeUrenOAqA4hFIcW4CX4wgRztIAFZ3OwgyJ8kd9QpnYNCGbSipAQArZrAK1WG0OcZTBa0DpdNawH72lNQI7iUh4LOukS0EoWiqVSQe6UtB5XbIm6v3YMMYhjXWe14Z7PYFjzEDkBtZkQsNSlUjzoXd6VvAdDgjkYsgIRjtMWjhLzNH0Ss2tx2-e32EPe3FPkeP63uUP4QQev4enua045k6-4Hve8jnJcUDJPAZyoNAJAvkaB4sL4mByjypAiAoX54BcLBnHgXCkLB8EQDhkHyGRCFjshDoPCw7IYVyWGUXhBFESRNEUfqPF0b++6MXiBJEtgpAAMzsQe+EQIRxGkXBCGUQo-FIYJYGMfAHySYwABM0kPLJ8ncUpFFAA)

For example

    interface iObj1 { x:string }
    interface iObj2 extends iObj1 { y:number }
    const someObj : iObj1 = {x:'hello'};
    someObj.y = 1
    someFunc (someObj as iObj2);

I could just be doing something stupid but this doesn't seem to work
