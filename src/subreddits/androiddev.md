I was just prompted to update the emulator to 30.0.0 stable this morning, but no release notes that I could find yet…

Hello, I am new to Android development but have an idea for an app I would like to create (yes I'm aware it already exists). I would like to create a "build your own soundboard" app that will allow the user to create sound buttons with imported or recorded sounds. I am developing in android studio.

The problem I am having is I am unsure of how to give the user ability to create a button. I am struggling to find resources online due to the massive amount of soundboard tutorials. I would like for there to be a + button that when clicked brings a popup and then results in a new button being available to click. Any guidance would be welcome and appreciated! Thanks!

## [7][Is Firebase a solution for building an API for my portfolio sample Android app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f63l48/is_firebase_a_solution_for_building_an_api_for_my/)

I have pretty much completed coding my sample app which I intend to use as my portfolio to apply for entry-level Android development jobs, going down the self-learned route since I don't have a degree in computer science. 

I have completed everything except storing information in a repository. I could just make the repository offline and included directly in the app, but I don't want to make the app to be too basic. I want to make my app a little more advanced to impress employers, and so I plan on having the repository placed in a server on the Internet for the app to then fetch the information from it through the use of APIs. 

I am still googling for solutions at the moment. One possible solution I see is to create a whole web application using Ktor  - since it's a Kotlin-based framework that I can code using Intellij IDEA, but I remembered something about Firebase. 

Sorry if this is a noob question, but would Firebase be the solution if all I want is to put a database there, set up an API, and get a API key for my Android app to use?

I wanted to create a Navigation bar like drawer that held some custom resources and custom widgets which would allow me to put them using constraint layout but this is not provided by android.

How do people create their custom libraries to do that? For example consider [this navigation bar](https://youtu.be/cRSmmCE3urQ)(check time code 1:15), it consists of a custom transformation for it's layout, manages layout overlaps and stuff like that. [He gives a source for that here](https://github.com/shrikanth7698/Custom-Navigation-Drawer/blob/master/customnavigationdrawer2/src/main/java/com/shrikanthravi/customnavigationdrawer2/widget/SNavigationDrawer.java).

Please give me a pointer how is this acheived or what knowledge is required to be able to do this. I'm willing to do my bit of research but I don't know where to start or what is used in achieving this. Is it done using OpenGL ES? Canvas drawings? ANY HELP AT ALL would be \*greatly\* appreciated.

## [11][What is currently the best ad provider for games besides admob or UnityAds ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f662e5/what_is_currently_the_best_ad_provider_for_games/)

I have been using unity ads since December, and the revenue was extremely inconsistent (one day alone I got 13$ for few impressions and other days I get almost nothing for 10 times higher impressions for the same countries)and overall performing low. I even notice unity ads isn’t even registering a lot of the completed rewarded video ads or impression.

I have the game both for iOS and Android, and I have players from various types of countries (from western countries like USA,France and Canada to developing asian countries like the Brazil,Phillipines). 

The unityAds team aren’t providing a satisfactory reply and keeps saying i need larger impressions to let their algorithms work better for the game. Even when there are multiple Americans and Canadians watching a complete rewarded ad per day, my total revenue per day is an abysmal 0.2$. I use both Interstitial and Rewarded ads.

I’m looking into changing ad networks at this point. Admob isn’t an option. Is Facebook Audience Network any good ?

So I need to make sure that a request to my API really comes from my app. My solution is to use an API key. But putting an API key in the app isn't safe from reverse engineering. Here are some solutions I found online:

**Solution 1: Hide it using NDK**

I can hide the API key inside a native code or do the entire API call there. But an attacker can still extract my .so file and use it to access my API.

**Solution 2: Save it in the server**

I can save the key in the server and my app will download the key everytime it needs to access the API. Or download once, encrypt it using Android Keystore, then save the encrypted key in the shared preferences. But an attacker can look for the code to download the key and do it manually without my app. Or he/she can sniff the downloading process easily using Fiddler, Charles, or Wireshark.

Is it really impossible to secure an API from unauthorized access?

EDIT:

Best solutions I found so far:
