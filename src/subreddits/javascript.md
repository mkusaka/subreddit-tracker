I hope someone can help me remember. I've found a tool recently (the tool itself might not be as recent) which made an attempt to reorganize your project's file/directory structure based on what file imported what. I've forgotten the tool's name and haven't recorded it either. Apparently, anything I put into Google doesn't yield any usable results.

Does this one ring a bell? What was it called? Thanks.
