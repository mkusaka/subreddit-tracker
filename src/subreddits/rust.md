Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g4nu6/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

[`dirs`](https://github.com/soc/dirs-rs) and [`directories`](https://github.com/soc/directories-rs) have more than 5 million downloads total, and more than 1.5 million downloads recently combined.

What happened? Why were they archived? Is it temporary, or they won't be developed anymore?

This is the problem on Exercism which I tried to solve in Rust.I couldn't get any mentor on exercism because they somehow decided to build more features and abandon their present users.I wish they would have asked for a paid subscription rather than leaving us for building more features.I hope they will come up with a more beautiful version of Exercism.

This is the problem to convert a vec of u32 from one base to another base.

```
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Error {
    InvalidInputBase,
    InvalidOutputBase,
    InvalidDigit(u32),
}


pub fn convert(number: &amp;[u32], from_base: u32, to_base: u32) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;, Error&gt; {
    
    
    if from_base &lt; 2 {
        return Err(Error::InvalidInputBase);
    }

    if to_base &lt;2  {
        return Err(Error::InvalidOutputBase);
    }

    if !number.iter().filter(|&amp;x| *x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; *x &gt;= from_base ).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;().is_empty(){
        return Err(Error::InvalidDigit(from_base));
    }
 
    let  res: u32 = number.iter().rev().enumerate().map(|(index, x)| x*from_base.pow(index as u32)).sum();
    Ok(convert_back(res, to_base))
    
}



fn convert_back(number: u32, base: u32) -&gt; Vec&lt;u32&gt;{
    
    let mut res: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = vec![];
    let mut inter = number as f64;

    loop {
        inter = inter as f64/base as f64;
        res.push((inter.fract()*base as f64).round() as u32);
        if inter as u32 ==0{
             break
             }
        
        inter = inter.trunc();
        }
        
        res.reverse();
        res

}

```
Some tests

```
fn output_base_is_zero() {
    let input_base = 10;
    let input_digits = &amp;[7];
    let output_base = 0;
    assert_eq!(
        convert(input_digits, input_base, output_base),
        Err(Error::InvalidOutputBase)
    );
}
fn input_base_is_one() {
    let input_base = 1;
    let input_digits = &amp;[];
    let output_base = 10;
    assert_eq!(
        convert(input_digits, input_base, output_base),
        Err(Error::InvalidInputBase)
    );
}

fn decimal_to_binary() {
    let input_base = 10;
    let input_digits = &amp;[4, 2];
    let output_base = 2;
    let output_digits = vec![1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0];
    assert_eq!(
        convert(input_digits, input_base, output_base),
        Ok(output_digits)
    );
}

[Tranche](https://crates.io/crates/tranche) is an alternative to slices, representing them as a pair of start/end pointers instead of a start pointer and a length. This is the same representation that `std::slice::Iter` uses. You may ask why I wanted that, and the answer is that I merely wanted a `take_front` method like in [this PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/62282).
