**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

To learn c++, I worked on implementing the research paper Efficient Graph Based Image Segmentation. I have finally finished implementing it and have also written a blog explaining the research paper and my implementation. Please give it a read. 

As the name suggests, Graph based Image Segmentation used graph like data structure and graph algorithms to segment images. 

In the blog above I have tried to add as much intuition about the paper and also intuition behind my implementation. I'm interested in computer vision and wanted to learn cpp too. Hence, I decided to go with this project. Although I'm not new to programming, I'm new to cpp.  Any constructive feedback from good practices of cpp to error-prone blocks of code is highly appreciated :)

I finish my 3rd year in high school in 2 days. I want to be a software engineer in the future (mainly C++/web development/python), knowing that I've spent half of my life on a computer and always wondered how these things work. I also want to get a bit in hardware.   


Having that said, I recently noticed that I'm scared to try out new things. I started programming a bit in the start of 2018 (1st year high school), but never really came back to it since. Last thing i remember learning was classes/objects.  


During quarantine I decided to start doing something valuable for once in my lazy life. So i did, i guess. I started learning from Bjarne Stroustrup's ***Programming: Principles and Practice using C++***. It's fun, challenging and really makes you think outside the ordinary. I really like that it has real world programs that you can immediately start writing. I was amazed of how fast you can create simple programs with such little knowledge. Although practical, the exercises can be a hassle sometimes.  


I finished reading chapter 4, tried solving the exercises and I was greatly discouraged of my lack of knowledge. So I took a pause (to game with my friends) for about a month and a half and started reading the book all over again.  


I don't know if it's cheating to look at other people's solutions to the programs, but I was having such a hard time that I had to. I still do sometimes, but have a MUCH easier time figuring out how I wanna lay down my thoughts. After reading the chapter again, I was finally encouraged to start thinking differently - I even started debunking how a program's flow should be, writing it on a peace of paper. I try as much as possible to translate real world common sense into a computer that's as dumb as a rock.  


I started documenting my answers, going as far as making a neat little OneNote document that you can check out here: [https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ap705yZCur1zhOdpXcSUJRVegFtTUg](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ap705yZCur1zhOdpXcSUJRVegFtTUg)  


Finally, I wanted to get advice from more experienced people than me for **exercises** 11-14 from chapter 4, surrounding the prime numbers. In addition, when comparing my answers to the answers from these 2 sources: 

* [https://programming-principles-and-pratice-using-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch4-computation.html#exercise-11](https://programming-principles-and-pratice-using-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch4-computation.html#exercise-11) 
*  [http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/Ch4.html](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/Ch4.html) 

i feel like my answers are so short that it makes the programs less effective - rather, I'm not really "leaning" or creating programs that mean "good programming",but instead "fast programming". Will this kind of tackling problems cause any problems in my learning experience and in my programming in the future? The books states that I should be precise, effective and fast, but I just don't feel like I'm achieving any of that by creating such short programs.   


Thank you for reading this and making time in order to help me. It really means a lot to me.

I'm looking to practice embedded system programming and looking for recommendations on a beginners kit.  I see many kits available online but looking for recommendations.  Something like the link below, or a Raspberry Pi maybe?  Curious what others have used in the past.  Thanks!

Just created a route planner project using the io2D library ([https://github.com/iparikshitdubey/Route\_Planner\_using\_io2D/tree/master/CppND-Route-Planning-Project](https://github.com/iparikshitdubey/Route_Planner_using_io2D/tree/master/CppND-Route-Planning-Project)) as a part of my Udacity Nanodegree program. Although I understood most of the code the implementation and rendering of the io2D library are still beyond my understanding.
