I have been reading up on enums and their application in android development. specifically kotlin android development.

I have seen thoughts and counter thoughts. But the issue is that most of the arguments i have seen are as far back as 2- 5 years ago. 

I would love to hear up to date thoughts on whether to use it. as well as links if possible.

Thank you all in advance

I'm an ML engineer that works with sensor data and I want to make a demo of my company's software in an android app. We export our models to header files in c/c++, where we run feature-extraction + prediction.

I'm envisioning a pretty simple GUI with the sensor data plotted in one frame and its classification in another. Usually I write these apps in matlab for a laptop/tablet and latency is sometimes an issue due to trying to plot a lot of data points (high sample rate) as well as matlab having a lot of overhead -- but the "SensorsLab" android app plots real-time data from 8 physical sensors so I think what I'm attempting is do-able on a phone.

My entire experience with android/java is one personal project where I passed each camera frame to a c++ function for image processing in opencv via JNI, so I have a few questions:

* For a data stream coming from either microphone/accelerometer/gyrometer, would the same principle hold? (Passing one frame of data via JNN to a c++ function)
* What library is preferable for plotting time-series/signal data? 
* I saw CNLohr build an app entirely in C. I think I'd rather use Android Studio, but I wanted to hear everyone's thoughts on that as well

Any feedback is much appreciated - thanks!

Ever thought what prevents us from tricking the system into hiding the [soft input keyword](https://developer.android.com/training/keyboard-input/visibility#ShowOnDemand) which is being used by some other application, or releasing a wake lock acquired by another application. This blog tries to cover some of Android's security internals.

## [8][Detect s-pen input on samsung tablet in order to make straight lines?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j5j0l8/detect_spen_input_on_samsung_tablet_in_order_to/)

So I hate the fact that Onenote on android is really limited. I have this Samsung tablet on which I take notes in class with the s-pen.

I would like to programm an app that at the end will be a circle over the interface like others apps already do. Simply you press the circle and till is pressed you can draw straight line.

I already looked for a solution but I didn't find any.

So I was thinking that I need to detect the input of the pen and write some code where I define x and y that is the position of the start, etc.(I didn't think about this yet but it's okay It will be the funny part anyway, right?lol). I have experience in coding and I would like to put this project on the cv..

What do you suggest? It is possible or I am understimate everything?

I saw Ionic as a framework that can be a good option but still I don't know how to somehow detect the s-pen input.

Thank you

## [10][Managing Many Android Phones for Development](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j51o4k/managing_many_android_phones_for_development/)

Hi there,

We are working on an app and so far we have 4 different Android phones for development. I guess the number will grow to 10-20 handsets within the next 6-9 months.

My question is how do you or other companies manage all these Android phones from the very beginning once you get a new phone (and you need to sign in with a GMail account), do you do one GMail account per phone or do you use one GMail account for all development phones?

I came across Google's cloud identity and Microsoft's Intune for "Endpoint Protection" so you can manage all these devices and you pay per device but I don't know if that's a good option. Here is what I want to do exactly:

1. Sign in with one email account
2. Deploy the same apps on all phones remotely instead of doing it manually on each phone.
3. Locate all phones (through a dashboard for example) to see which is on/off, where is it each phone located, which network is it connected to, ...
4. In case one phone is lost or stolen, lock it and then wipe it if I can't have it back.
5. Other features like disabling the installation of more apps won't be necessary at this stage, but it would be good to have.

I guess the main thing that I'm after would be not creating an account for every phone and having a dashboard to remotely control all the phones.

By the way, we are using Office365

Thanks!

I have bought a development board that runs Android 4.4.2. 
But it have only supports Wi-Fi and no  Ethernet .Now I   want to use it as Miracast Receiver,use WLAN is a bit slow and unstable.
So I bought a USB to Ethernet module.I can use it on my Windows 10 computer and Android 7.0 tablet without any drivers.
But when I plug it into the development board,it cannot recognized the module.
So how can I let the development board connected to Internet  via USB Ethernet module?Do I need some drivers , thank you.
