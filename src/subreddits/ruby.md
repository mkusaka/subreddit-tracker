Hello guys :) 

Is it possible to scrape an element by value of it's attribute? 

So I got **n** &lt;a&gt; elements and i need to scrape src attribute of an &lt;a&gt; element who's title value is, let's say, 'blue'.  The problem is that I don't know how to get the right one because it doesn't have class or id. 

I've also thought about going trough each a in that specific block and compare the attribute of &lt;a&gt;element with wanted result.

can you give me any advice :) 

(im newbie in web scrapping abd ruby btw. )
