I want to create a MERN social media app where I implement infinite scrolling to fetch posts as the user scrolls down, at the same time caching them in the redux store. However, I was wondering whether the  store can run out of storage or get full if the user scrolls too far down and I fetch too many posts. Does redux have a limited storage? Is there a better implementation (not storing posts in the store but fetching them on every re-render)? Can React Context api also get jam packed?

To keep myself entertained during quarantine, I've been creating silly projects. 

Over this weekend, I created a service that randomly matches users in a one-on-one phone conversion, where they can chat anonymously for 5 minutes.

I created this using Create-React-App (Front-end), Firebase (Back-end) &amp; Twilio (Calling).

Try It: [https://start-a-conversation.firebaseapp.com/](https://start-a-conversation.firebaseapp.com/)  
Github: [https://github.com/NickMandylas/start-a-conversation](https://github.com/NickMandylas/start-a-conversation)

\--

**How does it work?**  
Sign in using your mobile (SMS verification). Join the queue, we'll match you with a stranger, and you'll receive a call from our bot. \*Queuing can take a while, so you can close the window &amp; it'll keep you in the queue.

**How does it keep me anonymous?**  
It calls you! The bot sets up a conference call between you and your stranger. We call you via a landline and merges you in once you accept. No data/phone number is shared between you and your matched caller. Think about how Uber handles calls between you and your driver.

**How do you handle matchmaking?**

1. Using Firebase Realtime Database, all users who enter the queue, they have a user entry is created in a "matchmaking" table with the status "in-queue". 
2. When a user entry is created, a firebase function is run that finds another player with a status "in-queue". 
3. If a match is found, a match entry is created in the "matches" table, with the "matchId" &amp; "userIds". 
4. When a match entry is created, a firebase function is run that calls both user's mobile phones &amp; setups a conference call for the two users. The call time length is set to 5 minutes.

Hello, everyone! I'm new in reactjs and I'd like to know what's better? To use redux or hooks? React-bootstrap or something else? Create a million components with their containers and the right structure, or write in a common component creating separately only those components that I will use more than once. Is there something right? Or is everything at your discretion?

Auth, subdomains and payments would be great  
Prefer NodeJS, Docker, Redis/PostgreSQL for backend stuff  
No need for fancy design, functionality first

What did you use last time you built SaaS?

I just discovered [framer-motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) and it's actually ridiculous how easy it is to create complex animations and what it does to improve the look and feel of a website.

Anything else life-changing out there? Can be funny, can be useful, can be just plain genius! Would love to hear about your discoveries. No links to generic lists please, tell me about your own personal experience and why you like it.
## [12][onscroll scroll one entire section at a time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j91exq/onscroll_scroll_one_entire_section_at_a_time/)

Hello.

I am making a website where the idea is when you scroll down you will scroll all the way down into the next section and if you scroll up you will scroll up to the previous section for all the sections. Does anybody have a good idea how to do this in react or a library that does it? 

&amp;#x200B;

I could patch together a solution that would work but I would like to know the best way to achieve it.
