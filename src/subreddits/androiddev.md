This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

## [7][Is it possible to change password after encrypting database content with Password-Based encryption??](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jpn96f/is_it_possible_to_change_password_after/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jpn96f/is_it_possible_to_change_password_after/
---
I am creating an android app where the app would encrypt some user data with AES Password based encryption. The password would be the password which the user used to create an account in the app. I am using Password based encryption because I think it is more secure than storing the Encryption keys somewhere inside the application.

The problem is that user won't be able to decrypt the data if he changes the password.

So is there any way to solve this problem??

Or do I have to use other kind of encryption?

Hi guys,

My app recently has started get organic downloads - 400/500 a day!

However my conversion rate is low, around 30%.

How can that be improved?

Also can you guys give me some feedback about the UI/UX? Is my app easy to understand? :)

Right now I am fixing the core of the app, to allow users to type in any sentence rather than pre-selected sentences!

I've developed some apps that work along with the Wear application. I've gotten away with not including the smartwatch screenshots. But I'd like for new users to see the Wear app in the Play Store and want to create screenshots for a picture that includes both the phone and the smartwatch in one picture or separate, if possible. There's plenty of sites that are free but are limited when it comes to smartwatch screenshots. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!
