**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft?

## [3][How does GCC implement vector containers in C++? A blog series on diving deeper into the source code of vectors!](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gi2m0i/how_does_gcc_implement_vector_containers_in_c_a/)

Hi everyone!

I've always loved reading source codes of the libraries I would use, and just recently - I started taking a look at how GCC implements some of the core methods for vector containers in C++. I'm happy to share the series of blogs (total 3 blog posts) which explain:

1. The base struct (\_Vector\_base and \_Vector\_impl) and it's methods.
2. Memory allocation and deallocation of vectors.
3. What happens when a vector constructor is called?
4. How are method functions like \`push\_back\`, \`pull\_back\` etc. implemented under the good?

and more!

Here are the links to the blog posts:

1. [Understanding how Vectors work in C++ (Part-1): How does push\_back work?](https://krshrimali.github.io/How-Vectors-Work-in-C++-Part-1/)
2. [Understanding how Vectors work in C++ (Part-2): What happens when you initialize a vector?](https://krshrimali.github.io/How-Vectors-Work-in-C++-Part-2/)
3. [Understanding how Vectors work in C++ (Part-3): Diving deep into mostly used methods of Vectors](https://krshrimali.github.io/How-Vectors-Work-in-C++-Part-3/)

I must confess that I'm still learning, and I am looking *actively* for any constructive feedback on my blogs. It has been a great learning for me, to be able to understand and share the design pattners used in the source code.

I have started trying to understand C++20 coroutines,  and the subject seems rather complicated. I've never used coroutines in any language, but have implemented a great many finite state machines, and I get the impression that's all coroutines really are, but with some details hidden by compiler support.

I guess FSMs have to explicitly switch on their previous state to continue execution, which might be considered ugly, but this seems a lot clearer than a whole bunch of automagically maintained state, new keywords and auto generated code to return a promise or whatever. Plus the business of implementing the promise or resumable or whatsit. Tutorial sites appear to be of the form "Hello, Coroutines. Don't panic!", followed by a long panic inducing text. This is not encouraging.

Couldn't I implement a generator as a simple stateful class with a get_next() method? I could even throw in operator overloading to make it callable. I'm sure I'm missing something here...

So I guess my question is: are coroutines and FSMs formally equivalent?

Arthur Oâ€™Dwyer has one short [post](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/01/07/namespaces-are-for-preventing-name-collisions/) about his opinions on the use of namespaces in C++. However, I find it hard to completely agree with his opinion. While namespaces can be abused, it is still perfectly reasonable to use them to create taxonomies.

I will turn to the standard library for example. The well-known `std::vector` class, are not vectors in the math notion. It has never been an issue so far since the standard library doesn't have a class for vectors in linear algebra. However, there are proposals to add some basic linear algebra abilities to the standard library, their solution is to add it under `namespace std::math` (or something similar). Yet to avoid name collision, we have created taxonomies. If all current containers are in `namespace std::cont`, both can be called vector with a clear distinction. As the standard library becomes ever and ever larger, not all things can go into `std` directly, for instance, the new ranges algorithms and `std::chrono`.

It is true that namespaces are there to avoid name collisions but in the process of trying to prevent it, the namespaces we create are usually taxonomies. The approach of splitting things early, for example, use `std::cont` even if a math vector does not exist allows the ability to add new things while maintaining a consistent style and avoid name collisions.

I have ran into the issue of whether one should use emplace\_back to push data into a vector several times down. I documented my current views here [https://gumeo.github.io/post/emplace-back/](https://gumeo.github.io/post/emplace-back/)

Do you guys have any other views on this? Do you generally use emplace\_back and the how and why?
