We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [3][How do I write meaningful tests using React Testing Library?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ih6rl8/how_do_i_write_meaningful_tests_using_react/)

I've been starting to write tests using React Testing Library for my application. But I don't know if my tests make sense. I know React Testing Library says to write tests for your application from the users perspective. For example, if a user clicks a button then the button should trigger some type of action which you should be writing a test for.

But what about user authentication, user sign out, forms, making api calls etc.. It seems like if I were test every piece of functionality in my app, I would be writing endless tests.

**If you were to write tests for instagram, what tests would you write using React Testing Library that would actually make sense.**

Thanks

Hi everyone! I made a free React website to practice interview questions in Python. It includes written solutions. It would help me a lot to hear what you think! :) Also, I'm planning to make the whole project open source (frontend and backend), so let me know if you want to contribute!

## [7][react-microanimations colors: how to change it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ihktgf/reactmicroanimations_colors_how_to_change_it/)

There is this library of animated icons called [useAnimations](https://useanimations.com/) which is easily implemented by [react-microanimations](https://github.com/useAnimations/react-useanimations) package. The thing is, the SVG comes with the fill colors and stroke set and it seems I can't override it with CSS.

Does anyone here ever used it and got it custom colored or know how to do so? Thanks!

I am trying to create a chrome extension with react.

 I want to inject my react app into the page dom. However i am not able to understand how the content scripts and background scripts work.

 I was able to put my react app as a popup but the state was not maintained everytime I click the extension icon the state resets.
