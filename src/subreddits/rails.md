I have been looking around for this kind of platforms, and stumbled upon Gumroad, BuyMeACoffee, and etc as possible solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

Any of you have experiences with these platforms or something similar to that? Or is it better to just make our own solution?

Hey Ruby People, 

I am thinking of switching from MacOS to Linux for my development machine. Have you made the switch, or do you dev on a linux machine? 

I'd love to know what peoples opinions are. :)

    cache “1” do
      cache “2” do 
         cache “3” do


If I change temple or code that produced cache 3, how can I invalidate 2, which then invalidates 1 aswell?

The idea was to have a cache based on filehash + templatehash. 

Children are called within the template , so I don’t know yet what children will be called 

Having an additional VERSION inside the classes is ok but then I need to change version +1 for 1 and 2, just if I change 3


General programming question I guess
## [6][Amazing course for on RAILS preferably PAID](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jr26sa/amazing_course_for_on_rails_preferably_paid/)

I can take courses at work, and I'm thinking of taking a rails course to up my skills. The course can be paid one. What I'm really looking for in the course.  

1. Internals of rails app, lesser-known features, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimizing code with design patterns and good testing techniques. 
2. Using APM's like new relic to monitor the health of the app
3. The devops side of deploying, CI, CD etc of a rails app. 

I do not want a beginner's course on creating a simple CRUD app. I want it to be something a little advanced than that. 

Could someone please suggest a good, paid course on this, or even multiple courses that cover this? 

Thanks.
## [7][For an Index page, should I calculate this info on the fly, or store it in the database?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jrbgnm/for_an_index_page_should_i_calculate_this_info_on/)

Hey there, I am working on a simple invoicing app and for my Clients index view, which will probably show 12-15 records at a time, I want each Client's table line to include some data like:

* How many outstanding invoices that client has (ie, 23 invoices)
* How many Paid invoices they have
* The dollar amount of all their invoices (ie, $18,453.52 total)
* The dollar amount of outstanding invoices

This seems like it might be a burden to have Rails calculate all this for 12-15 clients per index page, yes? This is my first project, so I'm just not sure, but it seems like it involves a lot of database work every time a user simply looks at their Client index page. So I was going to create a couple of Count values and Totals values columns the Client table, and just change them anytime a new invoice is created/deleted/paid.

Does this seem reasonable?

Thanks much!

I am working on a project with other people who are not too familiar with where files for different parts of my app are to be found. I'd like to add links that "open source file for this component on github".

Does anyone know if there is already such a gem available? If not, would anyone like to work with me on creating one. I imagine it could be very useful.

First post here, Rails was the first framework that got me started in web development back in a bootcamp 2 years ago. After that I found a job as a backend developer and had to use Codeigniter for most of the projects there.

After 2 years of working, I've slowly started using Rails for my side projects. But one thing that has been bugging me is the fact that I have to explicitly create routes to route each requests to a method.

How can I setup Rails to detect site\_url/{controller\_name}/{controller\_method} and automatically route it to the said method like how Codeigniter does it?

Hi All - was admiring how nice the collapsable navbar is for squarespace sites (especially on mobile) and was wondering if there was any documentation to mimic that activity with CSS/JS that you've come across.
## [11][How to solve simultaneous database r/w race condition with postgres/sidekiq?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jr1l6h/how_to_solve_simultaneous_database_rw_race/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jr1l6h/how_to_solve_simultaneous_database_rw_race/

I am running a service that creates 300 jobs at once (sidekiq and postgres). I have a workers pool of 20 and every job takes 4 seconds to complete.

I am also polling with plain Ajax/Jquery and displaying a percentage completion on a page.

I have an array type column on a table where I save the ids of the objects.

The problem is that 20 jobs are accessing the database together and overwrite the array storing faulty results.

I tried to solve this by using a pessimistic lock on the object but it failed. I tried also to add the action in a transaction and reload the object prior to writing.

    @poller.with_lock do 
      @poller.reload
      @poller.clients_replied &lt;&lt; client.id.to_s 
      @poller.save!
    end

So calling `poller.clients_replied` changes from `[1,2,3]` to `[4,5,8]` for example on two different concurrent writes.

I am sure you have solved cases like this so If you have to suggest anything please advice.

I don't want to use counter cache because I need the ids of the objects.

I've used Bootstrap for front-end elements with my Bootstrap applications in the past, but wondering if using something like Vue is more advantageous. Any thoughts on this?
