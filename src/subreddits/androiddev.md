This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [5][Activity onCreate not called until screen is unlocked?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ez8n2n/activity_oncreate_not_called_until_screen_is/)

I have a Service running in my app that starts an activity whenever a condition is met, however if this condition is met when the screen is locked, the onCreate callback doesn't fire until I unlock the device.

I have added the following to the activity in my manifest

*android:showOnLockScreen*="true"  
*android:turnScreenOn*="true"

I've also tried adding the relevant flags to the Window of the activity in onCreate, however since onCreate never fires while the device is locked this doesn't make a difference.

How can I get the activity's onCreate to fire when the screen is locked and in turn, turn the screen on and show over the lock screen of my phone?

&gt;Hiroshi Lockheimer, SVP at Google, has confirmed on Twitter that to date,  developers have earned over $80 billion in total from the Google Play  Store globally, excluding the Chinese market  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.xda-developers.com/developers-earned-over-80-billion-total-play-store/](https://www.xda-developers.com/developers-earned-over-80-billion-total-play-store/)

&amp;#x200B;

This means that Google made $34 billion in the same period. Considering that the earnings are proportional in these 12 years, Google has earned almost 2.9 billion dollars every year from developers' applications.

This proves that they have the operating margin to have a sufficient number of people, with experience and good skills, to manage account bans. They have no excuse when they leave most of the ban management to bots and only intervene when a case becomes of public interest.

Today I got my app removed because it contains a copyrighted word in the name. The email explains that I should rename it to something like [app name] for [copyrighted word] and that's what I'm going to do. However, I have some concerns about the package name. It looks like this: com.[my name].[copyrightedword][app name]. Is it safe to keep it the same or should I change it as well just in case and submit a new app?

My concern is regarding the storage issue.
As far as I know, even apps targeting older API level and using File based methods for storing data on internal storage will also not work.

So, seeing the total number of applications that still use this technique to store data, does in mean that Android 11 will render many apps useless? Will there be any backlash from the users?
