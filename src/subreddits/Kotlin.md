How can one configure Kotlin so that it can transpile to NodeJS source code, but also use modules such as electron?

When I use the project creation dialog with Kotlin JS|IDEA, I cannot see how to use NPM modules. When I use the project creation dialog with Gradle and Kotlin JS, I get the error message

    Plugin [id: 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.js', version: '1.3.61'] was not found in any of the following sources:

I'm studying using "Kotlin Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" (2018 edition) and on Java Interoperability chapter, the example is to use Java private fields as an ordinary property when calling inside Kotlin. No need to call getter/setter method for this Java private field. Here is the sample code:

`Jhava.java`

    public class Jhava {
      private String greeting = "BLARGH";
      public void setGreeting(String greeting) {
        this.greeting = greeting;
      }
    }

`Khotlin.kt`

    fun main() {
      val jhava = Jhava()
      jhava.greeting = "Hello"
    }

But `jhava.greeting = "Hello"` IntelliJ gives me an error `Cannot access 'greeting': it is private in 'Jhava'`. I'm not sure if the book is outdated or I'm doing something wrong here.

I can refer to variabeles and methods in the same class using this.method() or this.variabele . But the code also works when I don't use this. what's the differrence, and why should(n't) I use this.  ? thanks.

`fun compose(g: (Int) -&gt; Int, h: (Int) -&gt; Int): (Int) -&gt; Int {`

`}`

I'm supposed to return a function g(h(x)) but am having trouble putting it to code.  I've been returning single functions with the double colon notation, but that doesn't seem right in this case. Actually just having trouble wrapping my head around higher order functions in general but I guess that's why I'm here! Any help appreciated.
