Hey fellow android devs!

Since google has shutdown its multiplayer APIs, I'm looking for a (free) alternative. Currently looking at  [https://playerio.com/](https://playerio.com/) . Does anyone have some experience or other suggestions?

Just some context: In my game players have a "preparation" phase where they make some strategic decisions and then a "fighting" phase where they cannot interact but just watch how the fight plays out. Some gameplay can be found here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s05HF9LPITA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s05HF9LPITA) 

So I guess it would be enough if i send the result of the "preparation" phase and then wait for the other player to respond.

Any suggestions/feedback is very much appreciated.

Hey guys!

So as the topic says I can't get my PC to recognize my phone..

I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Snapdragon) with MIUI 11 Android 7.0 

The problem is that I connect my phone to the PC and nothing happens, doesn't even give me a connect sound and the phone just charges, not giving me any actions to choose from (mtp, ptp, etc). I have USB debugging turned On and still nothing, USB tethering is also grayed out for me. 
I would love to unlock my bootloader but can't due to this, it doesn't even show up in the device manager at all. I have also never connected my phone to the PC before.

I have tried:
- A billion different drivers, installing, reinstalling, and so. Sometimes I get a code error 10 (donno if it means anything at all)
- Restarting my PC and phone a zillion times
- I tried manually installing "wpdmtp.inf" (C:\Windows\inf)
- Different USB Cables and Ports (USB 2.0 and 3.0) (although all of them work for my brother's Sony phone except for mine) 
- Disabled Driver Signature Enforcement (I got a warning sign when installing drivers but it seems it did nothing)
- Tried multiple PCs (my PC (Win 10) and my dad's PC (Win 7)) 
- Installed MI suite, MiFlash and such but not even those recognize the phone, it just charged when I connect it to a USB.
- I enter Fastboot mode and the phone just automatically restarts itself after like 7-10 seconds
- Recovery mode is stable, doesn't restart but I don't have much options to choose (restart into phone, wipe data, connect to MIassistant)

I am completely lost and trying to figure out WHY it doesn't recognize my phone and only charges. 
I would appreciate any help and would be grateful for it.
Thanks in advanced!
## [11][Question about fragments and activities](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g8d8o0/question_about_fragments_and_activities/)

Hi, I'm in the process of making an Android app for my final year coursework at uni and I've been having trouble using fragments. 

I wanted a navigation drawer and was unsure of how to make one work without using fragments so I've been forced to make every screen of my app a fragment and this has been making my life rather difficult... 

Every tutorial I look at online creates its examples in an Activity rather than a fragment and then when I try to translate the logic over to a fragment things end up not working. Currently I'm trying to get SQLite working within a fragment. I have managed to get it working within an Activity but cannot for the life of me work out how to get it working in a Fragment. I've found having to use fragments a real boundary to me making any progress with many aspects of my app and I don't really know how to get around it. Is there any kind of set of rules for translating code written in an activity to a fragment? 

Also if anyone has any resources specifically about working SQLite inside a fragment it'd be much appreciated because I can't find anything useful online. Thank you for reading.
