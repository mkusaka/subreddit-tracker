We live in this scary time where most people have locked them up behind the walls of their homes, leaving several businesses inoperable. Considering the current situation, we are humbled by most developers, who are working tirelessly to build amazing apps for Android. However, regardless of whether you’re working from your home office or your living room on a laptop, you need tools to stay ahead from your competitors by building exceptional mobile apps. Android Studio 4.0 is all you need.

Recently launched by Google, Android Studio 4.0 brings new and advanced features for developers to code smarter and to build mobile apps faster with attractive designs. Being one of the best [Android app development companies](https://www.softprodigy.com/hire-android-mobile-developer/), we will highlight some of the exciting features of this new update.

**Here’s why Google’s Android Studio 4.0 is a major upgrade**

The most attractive highlight of the upgrade is an exceptional Motion Editor. It is a simple Android interface for creating, editing, and previewing MotionLayout animations in apps. Due to the lack of this feature in the previous Android Studio versions, the developers were required to create and modify complex XML files manually for animation designing. Thanks to the new Motion Editor, it automatically generates the XML files, while allowing developers to design complex animations with the help of the click-and-drag interface. 

Apart from this, Android Studio 4.0 also comes with an upgraded layout inspector and layout validation. The former offers a real-time and more intuitive experience when debugging your UI. On the other hand, a new layout validation allows developers to view UI across multiple screen dimensions. 

Another eye-catching highlight of the upgrade includes a Build Analyzer, which helps developers to understand and address bottlenecks in the build, a Java 8 language APIs, and redesigned CPU Profiler.

**Summary -** Google’s Android Studio 4.0 brings you new and advanced tools for building apps faster on every type of device. Learn what it has in store for the developers.

## [11][SurfaceView vs GlSurfaceView for live wallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/h0vjpg/surfaceview_vs_glsurfaceview_for_live_wallpaper/)

I've been creating a live wallpaper lately. Its principle is simple: open a GIF (animated or not) and you can display it as your wallpaper. [https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper](https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper)

To implement that, I've used a regular WallpaperService, that draw everything in a SurfaceView. It seems to work pretty well and is quite efficient. ([https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/redwarp/gifwallpaper/GifWallpaperService.kt](https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/redwarp/gifwallpaper/GifWallpaperService.kt))

But when you look at the really popular Muzei Live Wallpaper code source, they went for a GlSurfaceView instead. Their renderer doing magic here: [https://github.com/romannurik/muzei/blob/master/main/src/main/java/com/google/android/apps/muzei/render/MuzeiBlurRenderer.kt](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei/blob/master/main/src/main/java/com/google/android/apps/muzei/render/MuzeiBlurRenderer.kt)

So I'm trying to guess if there is a reason behind it appart from legacy, and if I should also take the plunge and go for it and use a GlSurfaceView instead.

Since Android 26, on a regular SurfaceView, the SurfaceHolder allows use to lock on a hardware canvas: [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceHolder#lockHardwareCanvas()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceHolder#lockHardwareCanvas()) which means that drawing get offloaded to GPU (my min app version is 24) so I wonder if there is still an advantage with going with OpenGl.

It's probably an old question, I find several stackoverflow topic about SurfaceView vs GlSurfaceView, but none applied to a live wallpaper.
## [12]["Teacher approved" or "teacher rejected" in Google Play?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/h0yds2/teacher_approved_or_teacher_rejected_in_google/)

Does anyone know what happens to apps that are selected for the "teacher approved" review but don't get approved? I have several apps for children, but none of them has the "teacher approved" badge yet. So I wonder if they are still in the review queue, or already have been "rejected by teacher".
