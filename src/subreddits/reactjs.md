I am making a frame by frame animation component. Basically it is like an animated gif only you can interact with it. So far, so good, it works, but the project is about learning and trying to get the best performance possible, so I am wondering about canvas vs. img tag.

The heart of it is this, (apologies for the extra brackets at the bottom, I removed extraneous code):

&amp;#x200B;

animator:

`{entity.actions.map((item,¬†index)¬†=&gt;`¬†

`{return Array.from({¬†length: item.length¬†},¬†(x,¬†i)¬†=&gt; i¬†+¬†1).map(x =&gt;`¬†

`{return &lt;img`

`style={{position: 'absolute',`¬†

`opacity: internalCount¬†===¬†x¬†&amp;&amp;¬†entity.name¬†===` [`animation.name`](https://animation.name)¬†`?¬†1¬†:¬†0,`

`height: size,`

`width: 'auto'¬†}}`

`src={\${entity.path}${entity.name}/${x}.png\`} /&gt;\`¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

`})¬†¬†}}`

So a counter fires and that increments a count in the animator called internalCount. All the images are preloaded and by looking at internalCount and animation.name we decide which image should have an opacity of 1. That's it, that's the whole thing, very simple, very straightforward and works okay.

The question is, would there be any performance improvements, or any differences at all, if instead of using an img element, I put a canvas there and swapped the images passed to the canvas. So it wouldn't be one canvas with lots of entites/sprites, it would be lots of components with their own canvases.

Would love some feedback on my current approach and if canvas would help.

Thank you!
## [7][How to reset initial state with useState Hook](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h99ctz/how_to_reset_initial_state_with_usestate_hook/)

Hey React friends. Ive been trying to learn React Hooks and I'm running into an issue when trying to reset my state back to its initial state of an empty array. I have a SignIn component where the user puts in their email and password with server side validation. The error state works just fine, but if the user tries to submit a non-valid field again then the errors continue to append to the page. My thinking is that I could have some logic in the onSubmit handler that would check to see if errors exist in state and then reset it to its initial state if they do exist. I've done that in the past using the class components with setState but for some reason I cant figure out how to do it with hooks.  


Thanks

`function LogIn({context}) {`  
 `const [formData, setFormData] = useState({`  
`email: '',`  
`password: '',`  
  `});`  
 `const [errors, setErrors] = useState([]);`  
 `const {email, password} = formData;`  
 `const onChange = (e) =&gt;`  
 `setFormData({...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value});`  
 `const onSubmit = async (e) =&gt; {`  
`e.preventDefault();`  
 `//resets error state to empty if previously rendered validation errors`  
 `if (errors.length) {`  
 `console.log('I work');`  
 `setErrors([]);`  
`}`  
 `//fires login action`  
 `//if errors are returned it takes error object values and adds them to error array`  
 `const res = await context.actions.signIn(email, password);`  
 `console.log(res.errors);`  
 `setErrors([...errors, ...res.errors]);`  
  `};`

  
`//rest of the component......`

I‚Äôm thinking start a start-up and will be remote. I‚Äôve done due diligence. I‚Äôm thinking, can coding my project within 8m or 1 year with waterfall project management. I guess many remote jobs are using SCRUM and Agile. I haven‚Äôt been other project management systems. As a solo-entrepreneur, I want to create a team and manage it. How should I do this and which project management system?

Dear kind people of this Forum, 

Is there a code-along illustrating React's UI functionality?a code along or tutorial or resource similar to this one \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h7invl/react_js_building_a_chat_ui_in_2020_session_1/)\]?  
I am specifically interested in a code-along illustrating how react can be used to create rich UI (for example an interactive online game etc. just because such apps seem to be the benchmark in UI capabilities).
