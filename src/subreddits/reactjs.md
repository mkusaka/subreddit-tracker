We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I see a lot of questions on how to store variables, when to use useMemo or useState, etc..., so here is my simplified view on their use case.

1: useState

Expect Change: YES

Change Type: Proactive

Trigger hooks/renders on change: YES

&amp;#x200B;

2: useMemo (storing a variable) / useCallback (storing a function)

Expect Potential Change: YES

Change Type: Reactive

Trigger hooks/renders on change: YES

Computing cost: Heavy (thus use dependencies for reevaluation)

&amp;#x200B;

3: variable declaration inside a react component without any hook

Expect Potential Change: YES

Change Type: Reactive

Trigger hooks/renders on change: YES

Computing cost: low (thus it's better to reevaluate at each rerender)

&amp;#x200B;

4: useRef

Expect Change: YES/NO

Change Type: Proactive

Trigger Hooks/renders on change: NO

Specific to component: YES

&amp;#x200B;

5: variable declaration in outer scope.

Expect Change: IRRELEVANT

Trigger Hooks/renders on change: NO

Specific to component: NO

Like the title says, I published my first React hook a couple of days ago. I built the same sticky header twice in a couple of weeks so I decided I should build something I could reuse. 

Im mainly looking for what I could have done better here, or any way to improve the package.

## [12][Using anchors with React: use ref or use querySelector?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g764hy/using_anchors_with_react_use_ref_or_use/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g764hy/using_anchors_with_react_use_ref_or_use/
---
Hey all!

I want anchor links in a React page and see two solutions but I hesitate between both:

1. Using classic anchors with the id attribute and, in a useEffect hook, get the target from the URL with document.querySelector
2. Using refs, placing the ref on the target div and then, in a useEffect hook, scroll to the ref

Both violate the DOM encapsulation at some point so I wonder why not use the simplest solution (the first)? I consider it simpler because using a ref means conditionally setting that ref to the target div while the first solution only requires to use static ids on each div.
