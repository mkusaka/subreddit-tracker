Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

subj. Last year there was a proposition to make it ( http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1688r0.html ). Can't find anything about it now. What's the status? Are there any public drafts?

I'm doing some self-teaching and I was recommended these two books. Does anyone have any experience with either?

Hello,

as you know many IDE's/Editors feature a "Go to definition" command that finds the definition of whatever the cursor is currently on. If you have a large and complex program, these tools will/can only work if they know the build process.

What tool can you recommend my for "Go to definition". I need one that not only works in most cases, but in all cases(so it needs to know the build process). The build process is a fork of gnu make, but I have a [json compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) that I generated using [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear).

&amp;#x200B;

I basically need the rust language server, but for c++ instead of rust.

So, basically, I've been learning C++ for a while, and it makes sense, and I understand the concepts up until C++11. That's where I feel that the commitee had added things that are just useless, and I can't find any use for them, and I'm probably wrong because I'm overwhelmed by the amount of new things, so can someone give me resources to learn those new things? Every tutorial that I saw about the topic was showing things like std::move, and move semantics, smart pointers, etc, all of which are prior to or was added in C++11. Any help is appreciated!

I have a NN that I've converted to a header using tensorflow-lite -- now I want to build an app that pulls in audio from my laptop's mic so I can predict on it using my model.

Is juce the best API to use for this? 

I'd also like to plot the audio in real-time (or close to it). What library do you recommend for this?

I'm new to cpp but have plenty of experience with matlab/python. Any suggestions are apprecfiated - thanks!
