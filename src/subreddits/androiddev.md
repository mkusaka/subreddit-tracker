This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I saw it when checking news. Facebook takedown many Instagram private API projects on GitHub 

[https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/01/2020-01-22-facebook.md](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/01/2020-01-22-facebook.md)

I think Play store should do the same, they need to takedown apps like Downloader/Saver for Instagram, Facebook or Twitter... to protect user's copyright. But revenue from apps can't make Play store doesn't do this.

I have implemented stripe, video, gesture finger movements, JSON api calls in my iOS app. 
Where do I start? What is the best environment that will help achieve my android app

I consider contracting someone if I cannot succeed
 (may be the best route but I consider a frugal budget – therefore at this moment there is no much income)

Thanks
## [7][Where I can find in-depth tutorial about Lottie Animations](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/exnceb/where_i_can_find_indepth_tutorial_about_lottie/)

I've been using Lottie this couple weeks and it works great for project I've been working so far. But as a hobby-ist, I'm insecure about things I've done and improvement that could be made.

I've been searching for lottie tutorial but can't seem to find things that I want to do. I can do it myself but I think there's another way it could be done, better.

Things that I want to achieve:

- Use 1 animation/json file for multiple animation state. Ex: Play 1-15 frames at start of activity, play frame 16-30 as loops while the activity is in play. and play the next 31-45 frame when a method is being executed.
- fluidly tie animation to button state.
- better workflow to create animation that can be modified programatically

Is there any tutorial out there that can teach "best-practices" for these? I've been self taught so far and often felt like my way of coding is not the best.

I've built a game from a YouTube tutorial. Now I'd like to make a copy of my project and start tinkering with it. I've found instructions online  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMK-RBVLeIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMK-RBVLeIY)  . However, I notice that within Gradle Scripts, build.gradle(Project:ORIGINALNAME) appears rather than build.gradle(Project:NEWNAME). Is there a way to change this, or is the project name permanently stamped on the gradle scripts? Thanks in advance!

## [9][Do custom ROMs also update underlying android kernel version?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/exlunb/do_custom_roms_also_update_underlying_android/)

Stock ROMs forever stuck with the Linux kernel version which the device was initially shipped with. Most of the time OEMs keep the same kernel version even when updating android to next version to maintain stability and decrease extra effort to update stock kernel to upstream android kernel version.

Lot of devices get custom ROM support with latest android version. Do these ROM also update stock kernel to the upstream android kernel or do they run with stock kernel in boot.img device already have?

Android job interview became truly ridiculous there days!

Android SDK is so huge and is getting bigger, add old school Java (one day I stepped upon a vipers nest "job opportunity" - the very 1st question was "what are all methods of java.lang.Object.java" and I immediately run away from those freaks), new school Kotlin maddness, add Android BLE quirks, backward compatibility here, forward compatiblity there and you get insane.

Next time I get the feeling that the person I'm talking with is trying to be a smart-ass I want to tell him "listen, Android SDK is X milions of lines of code and you're trying to ask me about one of it, are you feeling ok?"

Can you people tell me what is X?
