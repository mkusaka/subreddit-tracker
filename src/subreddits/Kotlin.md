Kotlin is one of the best coding languages that developers use to build Android apps. Initially, we had Java, as the only programming language used by Android app development companies**.** After the launch of Kotlin, Java’s monopoly has come to an end. However, due to various advantages, this coding language gained a lot of popularity in no time. 

Let’s dig deeper to know why Kotlin is getting the most attention from the Android developers. 

**The most exciting features of Kotlin** 

Kotlin is a programming language, which has been created to make code writing for Android apps much simpler and productive. It comes with a wide range of striking features that also support Java, which significantly improves the efficiency of Android developers. 

Another attractive ability of this feature-rich coding language is its usage with Java. Below we have listed some of the most impressive features of Kotlin.   


* **Compatibility with Java codes** 

Since it has a feature that can convert Java codes to Kotlin, developers working on existing Android apps find it extremely useful.   


* **Works in unison with Java** 

As mentioned already, Kotlin is created to improve the expertise and productivity of Android app developers. Thus, its feature interoperability of codes allows developers to write modules that will work in unison with Java codes.   


* **Concise code structure** 

Kotlin comes with a concise and refined code structure, which helps developers to skip lengthy codes and improve coding efficiency. 

Apart from this, other features of Kotlin include:

* In-built safety measures to prevent any errors.
* Using Kotlin, developers can synchronize with multiple threads, while making modifications in the data. 

Given the numerous benefits and increasing adoption of Kotlin among Android app developers, the future of this coding language seems promising. However, depending on your project’s needs and your budget, you can either choose Kotlin or Java for your next project.

I've been looking into the threading model of Java's upcoming Project Loom and looks really simple and nice to use. I'm just coming into Kotlin but do think that this will be the future of threading (funnily enough we've came full circle with green threads).

So long story short i ran into a slight problem and I'm currently stuck .

Create a function using fun that receives two positive integers and an anonymous function. The function received as a parameter receives one integer and returns an integer. The function created using fun uses the two integers received as a the high and low of a range of integers. The function received as a parameter is then called once for each integer in the range, i. e. each integer in the range is used as the actual parameter. The sum of all the returns from the function passed as a parameter is then returned from the function created using fun. Make two calls to the function created using fun. One call passing the function from (d) and one call passing the function from (e).

Below Ill post my other two sets of code For "d" &amp; "e".

D:

val pow: (Double) -&gt; Double = **{it**.*pow*(**it**)**}**

E:

val  Prime: (Int) -&gt; Int = **{**// Store the result in a mutable variablevar result = **it**for (i in 2..**it**/2) {if (**it** % i == 0) {result = 0break}}result**}**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be greatly appreciated even if it's just hints or maybe ways i can go about do this . Me and my buddy have been stuck on this for a while

I have an app where I need to transfer data from a controller to my flow function, but I haven't seen any flow functions with parameters.

So I want to receive data in the controller, send data to my producer function (flow function), and then consume it from my consumer function.

Something like this - [https://pl.kotl.in/KAc-WTwAk](https://pl.kotl.in/KAc-WTwAk)

&amp;#x200B;

I am probably using flows wrong but, maybe someone knows how to get the solution with flow instead of channel

I have used [jsonschema2pojo](http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/) for generating Java objects from JSON. Unfortunately, the converter doesn't offer to generate Kotlin objects. Does anyone know a good converter that creates Kotlin objects from JSON?
