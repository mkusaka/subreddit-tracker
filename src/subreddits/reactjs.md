We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

TLDR; i studied MERN full stack from The Odin Project for 6 months and made my first app, link for repo and demo at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before i start doing anything i was so confused, what to start, where to start, etc..., i wasted enough time comparing and reading "the difference between "bla" and "bla bla bla".

I never had interest in web dev, but after trying android dev for one months i didn't like, then i came by [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ef6ers/top_best_plans_to_learn_fullstack_web_development/) which was a treasure for me and i read the comments and asked some people in the field then i started with "The Odin Project" which i think it's really amazing and got me through a lot.

and i finished it (MERN full stack) in like 6 months (not really committed)

&amp;#x200B;

what i learned through all this time:

\- Don't waste time comparing between languages or technologies, just start away

\- You will learn more by doing not only reading or watching videos

\- stackoverflow or (google) is your best friend

\- you will never stop learning, cause that field (CS) is really huge like omg

\- i always used existing libraries cause i don't wanna reinvent the wheel

\- literally i found library for everything i wanted

\- I really know nothing lol

&amp;#x200B;

I made this app which I'm really happy about as a newbie started from 0

i will be glad if you take a look and evaluate my work (just ignore the ugly design lol)

and give me a review about my code.

\*\*Should i start looking for a job now or just wait and finish other big projects? 

&amp;#x200B;

and This is the [Github Repo](https://github.com/hamohuh/inventory-application) and this is the [LIVE demo](https://afternoon-atoll-93127.herokuapp.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much

Hi guys, in the past couple of days I created a dice roll simulator for DnD.

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/mhogeveen/dnd_dice_roller/?)

and the deployed version [here](https://mhogeveen.github.io/dnd_dice_roller/)

I would love some feedback on the code I wrote. I'm still very new to React (and Redux) and could use all the help I can get.

I'm working up to finding a job as front-end developer and will use this as a portfolio piece. So I would like make it as good as possible!

Thanks in advance:)

I made an Ethereum portfolio tracker over the weekend, by default it just tracks my portfolio but you can enter any ETH address and get all tokens from that wallet, let me know what you guys think and how I can improve it :)

Hi guys. Been using Reactjs for a while now fourth Firebase DB and not want to learn something else. Where should I go next? Mongodb?
And is there any good article or video guide to help choose the right db for the different project?
Appreciate any help. Thanks.

Hey,

Im building a react redux ecommerce.
Ive an api for a contact form which sends requests by email to buy products in the store. 

Ive set up required fields(email and click products) on the form but if i get the POST request from network tab in Chrome and testing this in POSTMAN application i can send this over and over without required.


Any suggestions on how to prevent Spamming the api?
## [12][readline error out of nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htypo1/readline_error_out_of_nowhere/)

A project I've been working on (create-react-app) was working fine, but out of the blue stopped working and gives this error:

    ./node_modules/sass/sass.dart.js
Module not found: Can't resolve 'readline'

Have tried updating/reinstalling all modules and undoing all changes before the error, but no luck. Any idea what happened?
