## [2][How to handle large data imports with validations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/etptuq/how_to_handle_large_data_imports_with_validations/)

I have a database that has around a million records and growing. We have started importing records from an external system for reporting purposes and we are adding anywhere from 5k to 100k records per table. 

The tables with 100k records being imported takes hours to finish uploading. We are trying to speed up the process because during the upload window the system cannot be used, since the reports might be wrong with incomplete data.

We tried pgcopy and it is really fast and finishes in seconds, so one option is to go down that route, but it is just a data dump and we do it manually which is painful. The other problem is we have validations on the system and checks across tables that we do in rails. We also update records in case a duplicate is found. Which is again done in rails, using a first_or_initialize.

So I was wondering if anyone knew a faster way to import large data while keeping the rails validations and duplicate updates in rails. Or is the only option to go with a raw SQL to import the data?

Hi guys

Recently added a video to the "reality tv" type of series I'm vlogging in youtube. It's not really a tutorial but rather a commentary / recording of how one would go about learning and building an application from scratch; in this case, an accounting system. It includes all mistakes / researching work / opinions etc. 

Warning: It may be a bit boring since I don't cut out anything to capture literally everything. 

Looking for suggestions or corrections or comments as to how I might go about a certain topic or even the video format itself.

Thanks.

I've cloned the repo of a Rails 5.2 app that I will be working on and I am trying to get it working in development but having some issues. When I run  `rails s` it seems to start fine but when I go to localhost:3000 I just hangs/freezes and won't load the page. The server logs show this:

    =&gt; Booting Thin
    =&gt; Rails 5.2.2.1 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
    =&gt; Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
    Both Evidence and its :state machine have defined a different default for "state". Use only one or the other for defining defaults to avoid unexpected behaviors.

      Rendered users/sessions/new.html.haml within layouts/sessions (50.5ms)

I also ran  `rails assets:precompile --trace` to try and see what's happening and it hangs/freezes at the point where it gets to  `** Execute assets:precompile` . Here's the full output:  


    ** Invoke assets:precompile (first_time) 
    ** Invoke assets:environment (first_time) 
    ** Execute assets:environment 
    ** Invoke environment (first_time) 
    ** Execute environment 
    ** Invoke bower:before_precompile (first_time) 
    ** Execute bower:before_precompile 
    ** Invoke yarn:install (first_time) 
    ** Execute yarn:install 
    ** Execute assets:precompile

What could be causing this and how might  it be fixed?  I'm using Ubuntu 18.04, Rails 5.2 and Ruby 2.5.3.  Are there any other logs/files/settings that I could post here to give a better idea? Thanks in advance for any help or tips!

Hi. I want to create an app that is automatically sending an email/sms to a user after a payment is made. The email sent contains a username and password that are stored in a database. The payers are not required to generate login information in order to make a payment. The website looks more simple than craigslist. My question is how do I do this? :) What are the marks/checkpoints I have to code my way to? Are there specific gems that might help speed up the building of the app? I am a complete n00b :) 10x

Hello! Well, I had a problem while I were doing the installation of pageflow [https://github.com/codevise/pageflow](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow)

But, in the moment that I execute the foreman start, I receive a  warning and I cannot connect to the localhost. This is the warning:

And I don't know why this is happening, I tried to look for a  question or solve this problem, but nothing. Now I'm stucked in this  point and I don't know how to go forward or what to do. Any help would be appreciated!

Hey guys!

I've come from IDE RubyMine, but I really want to simplify my experience and start using VS Code.

Everything is more or less okay, or at least you can used to VS Code experience except '.erb' files. It can either thread them as 'html' which completely kill Ruby experience either like Ruby files, but it's even more mess.

How do you usually work with '.erb' files?

I used this tutorial to add ReCaptcha to my project :

[https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Use-Recaptcha-with-Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Use-Recaptcha-with-Devise)

and I did everything it says for "registration" controller, and when I want to sign up a new user, the error "uninitialized constant RegistrationsController " appears on the screen.

Does it have something to do with file location? or views?

UPDATE : It has been fixed by changing registrations to users/registrations to routes.rb. But, it doesn't check CAPTCHA. What should I do now?

It's very strange not to find any discussion anywhere regarding the move of the Devise repo. Am I missing it?

Different Google/Reddit/DDG searches turn up nothing--I've never seen that before for something so widely used. No blog posts or issues discussions threads or other announcements that I can find, and kind of a random and empty new home for the repo.

Commentary on the state of the Rails community? (Were it a Node module I'd think there'd be an explosion of posts.)
