This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hey folks, I'm sharing my personal library that I use in every project of mine, it has things found working from StackOverflow to things I've written personally to take shortcuts, copied some from Github and modified them to work as intended just to make the Android development easier.

[Github Link](https://github.com/CraZyLegenD/Set-Of-Useful-Kotlin-Extensions-and-Helpers)

It lacks documentation, feel free to contribute or to use it in your projects, pull requests are welcomed as well as if something doesn't work feel free to open an issue or if you find your code add headers/credits that's yours and make a pull request.

I work on a  app which collects user data with his permission (we give justification and only collect if user accepts it).  

Location is the most important part of the data i am collecting. It is collected every 2 hrs, only when permission is given and GPS is turned on. Currently, app target SDK is 28, So i have not added BACKGROUND permission yet.

I read the developer blog and understood things. What i am not able to understand is how google play policy changes and increasing target SDK version to 29 , 30 impact my app separately.

Will i have to show permission dialog every 2hrs?

Any other way to get location with reduced accuracy and not going through all this pain of changed policies?

i read a lot of projects about indoor navigation but all of them require to set the start location and every time the user need initially to be in this location, in some cases it is not beneficial such as for blind users, is there a way to detect the position automatically using the available SDK such as ARCore and ARKit or this technology still doesn't exist?!!
## [8][What should I use to make animations and transitions in android?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fkocu3/what_should_i_use_to_make_animations_and/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fkocu3/what_should_i_use_to_make_animations_and/

I looked to the docs and I've found so many long docs talking about making animations from xml resources (sets, translate ... object animator, value animator) to programmatic code (Scenes, Transition's custom animations, ViewAnimationUtils), and there's also MotionLayout which is in beta 4 at the current time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda lost with all of these, is Motion layout the go to from now on for all animations?

You guys seen java keeping a firm market-share in android development ?
## [10][How do you decide on which devices to support when developing an Android app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fkk7y0/how_do_you_decide_on_which_devices_to_support/)

I want to ask a question about how you decide which devices to support when developing an app.

We are developing Unity apps that use sensors like compass, gyroscope, and accelerometer. There are so many cheap Android devices out there that have these sensors but aren't accurate enough. We need to figure out a list of devices that we can support, and it's YMMV for the rest of the devices. We cannot practically buy every device that exists out there and support each and every one of them.

We think that market share stats by the device (not the manufacturer) will give us a good starting point to limit the number of devices we want to officially support. Since there is no such data available officially from Google or Apple, can anyone recommend a good source for this info? I suppose there are companies built around this kind of thing?

Or is there a better way of doing this?

I appreciate your input.

A few weeks ago I shared a video about using Firebase to create multiplayer game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj-trslVFPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj-trslVFPc)

Now I want to share simple logic to connect devices that can be implemented in your own server: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pg5s6VJOqI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pg5s6VJOqI)

Both of these can help you migrate to new multiplayer system by the end of March.

New to android development, was playing around with some code and came across a problem thats been driving me insane over the past couple days so I thought why not see if anyone else can make any sense of it.

There's part of the code that's meant to send the users contact list to firebase when they open the app, and it creates a new child under their user in the real-time db with the list, but for some reason it only updates the list when I use the test accounts in my emulator and when I run the apk on my phone with normal accounts, everything else works, but it just doesn't make the new child with the list in firebase. I've checked the permissions, and they're all set to allow, but it just doesn't want to update the list.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this may be happening? I just don't understand why it sends my emulator contact lists, but not my phone's. 
All help is appreciated, tia
