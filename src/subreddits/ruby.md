I'd like to know if there is a method/gem/script that allows automating the validate the compatibility of gems when upgrading **ruby from v2.0.0-p247 to v2.4.6**. I have run the **bundle install** which made me update a few of them and also, I ran my tests with rake and all are OK, but I'm not so sure if I can get further issues down the road.  


Any help will be appreciated.

I can't get `rails new blog` to work. I have all the permissions. Removing --pretend flag isn't working as expected.

I was talking to a friend recently and I told them I'm learning Ruby, to which they responded by saying Ruby has no actual market value today aside from Rails. Is that true? And Ruby Devs in the field today, what is your take on Ruby's relevance?
