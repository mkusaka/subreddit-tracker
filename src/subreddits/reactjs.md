We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I quite understand the importance and the idea of the "key" attribute when rendering lists in React. Today, however, I was trying to observe the behavior of reconciliation when not passing keys to list items. It seems to me that React hooks the state from the item with the same index in the old list in the item with the same index in the new list. So I'm concluding that React falls back to indexes when not providing keys? Am I right?

## [6][How to avoid name conflicts between smart and dumb Redux components?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iwcwep/how_to_avoid_name_conflicts_between_smart_and/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iwcwep/how_to_avoid_name_conflicts_between_smart_and/
---
First of all, I love the idea of splitting components into smart/containers (which retrieve data from the store) and dumb/presentational ones (which simply render things). Makes them much easier to work with.

My problem is that their names are often duplicated. For example: 

    // Presentational component

    export function PurchaseButton(props) {
        return (
            &lt;button&gt;Purchase {props.count} items&lt;/button&gt;
        );
    }
    
    // Container component
    import {PurchaseButton as PurchaseButtonPresentation} from '../presentation/purchase-button';

    export function PurchaseButton() {
        const orderItems = useSelector(state =&gt; getOrderItems(state));
        return &lt;PurchaseButtonPresentation count={orderItems.length} /&gt;;
    }

As you can see, I had to rename the import to be able to use it in my container component, which has the same name.

But an even bigger issue are automatic imports in IDEs. When I start typing `PurchaseB...`, the IDE suggests to import `PurchaseButton` automatically. But there are multiple components with this name in the project. So before agreeing to import the button, I need to  look at the suggested options very carefully and make sure that I am importing what I want (e.g. the presentational component, not the container). And the first auto-import suggestion is often wrong.

Here are some suggested solutions I've heard:

- Using default exports. I don't know why this was even suggested - not only they don't solve the problems of auto-imports, but bring a few new ones, being a bad practice in general.
- Renaming things on import to avoid name conflicts. This is what I'm doing right now in my example, but, as I said before, there are still issues with automatic import suggestions.
- Using prefixes or suffixes for component names (e.g. `PurchaseButtonContainer` and `PurchaseButtonPresentation`). This seems sensible, but I've never ever seen this. Every code base I've worked with had `&lt;Panel&gt;&lt;PurchaseButton /&gt;&lt;/Panel&gt;`, not something like `&lt;PanelPresentation&gt;&lt;PurchaseButtonContainer /&gt;&lt;/PanelPresentation&gt;`. The lack of a common approach to this is the only thing stopping me from using these.

Is there a commonly accepted solution for this naming problem?

Thanks!

Hi everyone !

I want to share with you an interesting project I have been working on recently.

Spotify have an amazing API that anyone can use to get info about music from their repository.

 A very interesting feature that I was exposed to is called Audio Features, which contains metrics about the nature of the song. 

Like: denceability, how suitable a song is for dancing

 energy, how fast and noisy the song is.

An interesting idea that came to my mind is to use these parameters to compare the nature of the music of different artists according to their most famous song metrics.

I built a website that allows you to make the comparison and see the results on a graph.

 Link to website: [https://music-analyze.herokuapp.com/](https://music-analyze.herokuapp.com/)

 The project has been uploaded to GitHub, feel free to use it as you wish: [https://github.com/stavelmashally/music-analyzer](https://github.com/stavelmashally/music-analyzer) 

The project was built using React &amp; Node.js. 

I would love to receive suggestions for improvement or addition of additional features.
## [9][Component/library for creating desktop-like windows?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iw8y6y/componentlibrary_for_creating_desktoplike_windows/)

Hi,

I'm working on a project using React where I need to create something akin to a Windows desktop in the browser. I've been looking for a component or library that can provide windowing capabilities like you'd see in a typical Windows desktop, but I've come up empty.

Does anyone know of any you can point me at before I go through the effort of making one myself?

Thanks!
## [10][Is it a good idea to replace redux with apollo and GraphQL when using Django with React](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iwbir9/is_it_a_good_idea_to_replace_redux_with_apollo/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iwbir9/is_it_a_good_idea_to_replace_redux_with_apollo/
---
 I am starting a new project from scratch and I decided to use Django with React. But when I say react there are many developers who use redux as an essential library for state management but I think redux adds a lot of complexity in code. So I searched an alternative for this and I found some developers are not using redux at all instead they are using GraphQL + Apollo as an alternative. And I found this beautiful repository as well on Github that uses the Django with React but this is not using redux at all.

*Link to a package.json file of that GitHub repository* \- [https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-dashboard/blob/0d9f8662299a98de4c89bbdf5b8142a0e1790bc7/package.json](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-dashboard/blob/0d9f8662299a98de4c89bbdf5b8142a0e1790bc7/package.json)

**So, Is this a good idea of using Apollo + GraphQL instead of redux?**
