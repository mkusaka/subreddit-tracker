A few years ago (2015) I learned to develop full-stack web applications by following an online bootcamp. The bootcamp used Ruby on Rails as a framework. After the bootcamp I was able to develop my own web applications by using RoR.

Since 2017 I had hardly the time to develop since I had other career opportunities. However, now I would like to start building a new small application as a hobby project.

The app will mostly consist of CRUD operations and a real-time chat functionality. Nothing groundbreaking though. However I would like to experiment with providing the content in a true mobile app as well for iOS &amp; Android.

Before starting out though I have 2 questions where I hope you guys can help me with.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rails refresher**  
Before starting out I would like to refresh and recap my RoR skills. I was looking at the following two possibilities:

* Udemy course:  [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)
* Book: [Agile Web Development with Rails 6](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails6/)

Which one would you guys recommend? Any other recommendations?

&amp;#x200B;

**Feedback on application structure**  
My first idea was to follow the JS hype and build an API in Express and use VUE for the frontend. However after following some courses, I had the feeling that this setup was way too complex for a one-man hobby project. Furthermore my content should be optimised for SEO as well. In the JS world that would mean that I should use a Framework like Nuxt for example to serve SSR-content.

That's why I would chose for a "classic" RoR application. I could use Stimulus for the limited "interactive" functionalities and developing a native mobile app could be fairly easy [by wrapping web views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA).

Is this a good idea or should I follow the trend by using Rails as the API and develop a separate VUE front-end app?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot for the feedback!

Has anyone had experience using the [**omniauth-google-oauth2**](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2) gem for an app with a fairly large user base? 

I am trying to figure out which [Google Identity Platform pricing tier](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/pricing) it falls under, Tier 1 or Tier 2.

Anyone know?

I'm building a simple JSON API and id like to document some basic usage info about it -

- what the routes are
- what the params are (required, options, etc...)
- what the response looks like. 

I'm new to both ruby and rails. 

I'd love to just keep it simple with a comment on the controller action (is that the right place?) It would be icing on the cake to also auto-generate documentation, but it's not strictly needed. 

1. What's the best approach to document this info? Is there a comment standard or an open source tool that helps generate this in a certain format?

2. Are there any publicly viewable projects that I can use as an example guide?


Thanks so much!
## [8][HTML Query](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hjlpw8/html_query/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hjlpw8/html_query/
---
So I'm trying to query an HTML link, already have that much covered to gather the information I need. But I'm having some syntax problems on the Rails end of things to display it. I'm trying to do this on the controller level in order to make the request AJAX. As I said, I'm having a problem with syntax here and can't seem to find any explicit answers via google - so here's what's up:  


**API Query (from controller)** 

https://www.database.com/params 

**Expected return:** 

\["data1", "data2", "data3", "etc"\] 

I'd like to take this information and separate them into different arrays. So.. data1 could be a name and I want to pair it with names, data2 could be a location and I'd like to separate it into different locations, really just manipulate this data in general since I'm not sure how I want it to display on chartkick just yet. 

That's the general idea of it, here's the code I'm having a hard time with:

&amp;#x200B;

`class Charts_Controller &lt; ApplicationController`

`def query` 

`Above_Query`

`Transfer query results into different arrays (can probably figure this out myself once I know how to take in the results)`

`Result_Of_Query do render json: NewData.ChartkickParams` 

`end` 

`end`

I may be way off on the whole thing. If you have a better way of doing this, that's fine by me. It's just a rather large database that may contain a lot of information, so it'd be nice to do this via AJAX, but it is a personal project so I can cut a few corners for now.
## [9][Rails 6 - problem with method Stale? not working properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hjl335/rails_6_problem_with_method_stale_not_working/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hjl335/rails_6_problem_with_method_stale_not_working/
---
Hi guys. I'm using Rails 6 and I'm facing a problem while using the method stale? on AR relations - collections. The method stale? isn't recognizing changes on the collection, e.g updating the attribute 'updated\_at' of one record, therefore returning the 304 http code - page not modified. As result, the browser use the cached page instead of refreshing with a new one.

I found the same problem here [https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/37310](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/37310)

I copy the example from the above link to clarify what I explained above:

    # Controller 
    def index   
      @articles = Article.all
      if stale?(@articles)
        respond_to do |format|
          # all the supported formats
        end
      end 
    end  
    
    # Test 
    it "updates cache when one of articles is updated" do
      all_articles = create_list(:article, 10)
      response = get '/articles'
      etag = response.headers['ETag']
      expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      get '/articles', headers: { 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH' =&gt; etag } 
      expect(response.status).to eq(304)
    
      all_articles.sample.touch   
      get '/articles', headers: { 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH' =&gt; etag }   
      # HERE on next line assert will fail because server will respond with 304,    
      # because cache key for ActiveRecord::Relation will stay the same 
      expect(response.status).to eq(200) # =&gt; 304 
    end  

From my research, from Rails 6 and above, rails uses the following logic for creating key caches

    # collection_cache_versioning
    
    ### cache_key holds the stable information - generate from the SQL query
    Product.where("name like ?", "%Cosmic Encounter%").cache_key 
    # =&gt; "products/query-1850ab3d302391b85b8693e941286659"
    
    ### cache_version holds the volatile information - generate from updated_at and count
    Product.where("name like ?", "%Cosmic Encounter%").cache_version
    # =&gt; "3-20190522172326885804" 

From what I see and hopes, when cache\_version is updated (e.g updating updated\_at or count) the method stale? should stale the collection and create a new query and view, but for me that is not happening. One solution that I found is deactivate the collection\_cache\_versioning system to use the old system - the old system would create only one key, without versions.

I did test on my system using rails console and saw that cache\_version was changing when touching one record.

Does anyone faced the same problem? I didn't find another solution.

Hi, 

I'm trying to build a dashboard that includes a navbar and the container below it. So far I have the navbar and it includes a link\_to edit user profile, though I'm trying to rather than open it in a new page, render it in the container. 

I thought of adding it as a partial but I don't think that's the right solution as it will always be there (currently with devise's alerts are also always present too). What do you suggest would be the best way to do it? 

Basically I want to be able to show different components in the dashboard's container depending on what the user clicks. 

Thanks!
## [12][Gem for passwordless Auth in Rails API](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hj8zf6/gem_for_passwordless_auth_in_rails_api/)

I am on the lookout for a gem that enables passwordless auth (ie you only have to enter an email to be sent a magic link to login) in a rails API. Having looked this morning I’ve found examples that work when using rails for views but not any that are setup to work with only rails APIs. Just wondered if anyone knew of any?
