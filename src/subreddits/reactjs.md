I was so tired to find an open API that is (actually) useful.

 I wish there was a list of all the open APIs I can use. 

So, I googled and found a useful repository at github. ([Link](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis))

But it seems that repo isn't managed anymore. (Look at the issues and pr requests waiting there)

So I forked that and make new one.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone whose interested can check or contribute. ([Link](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists))

Thanks.
## [4][Redux pubsub?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ektu3d/redux_pubsub/)

Maybe I don't yet have the right mental model of Redux as I've now seen it used in different ways in a couple of, admittedly, messy projects. But can I use Redux with Thunk as a traditional pubsub type system?

If so, how do I connect events (i.e. actions) to other calls that have side effects, without having to explicitly design out a chain of dispatch calls? I'm assuming the right way to do it is to have the listeners watch for actions and know what to do.

The *listeners* get called in the reducers, but I can't take the payload and call another service to update the backend -  I can, of course, update the front end state, but it's now out of sync on the backend. Where do I attach the API call if the reducer can't make it.

For example:

* Click button
* Callback makes post to update service A, and returns payload of state.A, dispatching action.A
* Reducer B listens for Action.A and sees payload. It needs to take payload.A and update state.B, but should actually do it by calling service B and updating it's state when action.B is dispatched.

How do I trigger A and B without having to explicitly call dispatchA().then(payload.A, dispatchB(payload.A))?

I am lerning React.js on Udemy and the lecturer says that every React project he has worked on used Redux and everyone who is working with React should know Redux.

At the same time, I find Redux quite complex. At lest it introduces a new level of complexity which seems unneeded (for me as a learner). 

**Questions:** Do you use Redux in your projects? Why? Does a developer really need to know Redux if he or she wants to work with React?

I have worked in really challenging roles and did get good recommendations from previous employers. For some reason, I can't even get an interview chance.

What is wrong with my Resume??

I‚Äôm looking for an open source project that uses hooks and redux, with plenty of tests, especially complex integration tests. 
I want to learn about the architecture and testing of a non-trivial app. 

I already checked video courses (I prefer real code), github and top posts in this /r. Not satisfied with my findings so far (I‚Äòm fairly new to react, is not easy to find repos for three specific topics combined).

Do you have a favorite project in mind that cover all the bases?

Thanks.
