Hi, Rubyists. I have made a tool for previewing emails called *Postmortem*. It provides seamless integration (zero config) with ActionMailer and Pony and hopes to make email development a little less painful.

You can see the source and usage instructions on GitHub here:

[https://github.com/bobf/postmortem](https://github.com/bobf/postmortem)

Every time your application sends an email, *Postmortem* writes a colorful log entry with a path to an HTML file. You can open this file in your browser to see a preview of your email. The provided interface has a few tools for viewing HTML, plaintext, and syntax-highlighted HTML source as well as the usual header information (recipients, subject, etc.).

There is also a live demo linked in the README. I tried to include that link here before but the post got eaten by Reddit's spam bots.

All feedback is welcome. Have a nice weeekend and I hope some of you find this useful.

To me, a dsl and a function call look very similar so why the pushback when one leaves parentheses out on a function call? I think it looks more readable but the style guide does not recommend it.
## [9][Micro::Attributes - Create "immutable" objects. No setters, just getters!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ie69i7/microattributes_create_immutable_objects_no/)

Hello everybody, I would like to share one of my projects with you!

This gem allows you to define "immutable" objects, and your objects will have only getters and no setters. So, if you change \[[1](https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes#with_attribute)\] \[[2](https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes#with_attributes)\] some object attribute, you will have a new object instance. That is, you transform the object instead of modifying it. 

Check out it [https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes](https://github.com/serradura/u-attributes).
