**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

What are the advantages of each? Are either missing anything major? Do you have any stories using either?

I am not trying to start an argument. I am just curious in how others feel because I don't have much experience with either.

I am a student looking to learn more of c++ but mostly I find things related to c++11 but I assume there should be more updates to c++ later than that. Where could I find resources to learn more modern c++ techniques?

If someone is not familiar with magic\_get (because i wasn't): [https://github.com/apolukhin/magic\_get](https://github.com/apolukhin/magic_get) 

CppCon 2016 video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abdeAew3gmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abdeAew3gmQ)

tl;dr: it can convert struct to tuple and tuple to struct (and do some other things) in C++14

If we can can convert structs to tuples and vice versa, perhaps we can also pack and unpack tuples into compatible tuples and create sort of named tuples by using the structs like this:

    auto f1() {
    	struct {
    		int x = 5;
    		std::string s = "hello world";
    	} ret;
    	return ret;
    }

I believe this is a standard C++14 without any hacks. To unpack (repack) such return value into another "named tuple":

    template &lt;typename To, typename From&gt;
    constexpr To unpack(const From &amp;from) {
    	remove_cvref&lt;To&gt; to = {};
    	boost::pfr::structure_tie(to) =
    		boost::pfr::structure_to_tuple(from);
    	return to;
    }

Return value of `f1()` can also be accessed a lot like a named tuple like so:

    auto f2() {
    	auto s1 = f1();
    	return std::make_tuple(s1.x + 2, "hello tuple"); // mind the const char*
    }

This is also standard C++14 without hacks, it returns \`std::tuple&lt;int, const char \*&gt;\`.

Usage of `unpack()`:

    const struct {
    	int y;
    	std::string str;
    } s1 = unpack&lt;decltype(s1)&gt;(f1());

And we can ignore some values using "idiomatic underscore" and `std::ignore` too:

    const struct {
    	//float f;
    	decltype(std::ignore) _;
    	std::string s;
    } s2 = unpack&lt;decltype(s2)&gt;(f2());

To complete this, "unrolling" a tuple into list of function arguments is `std::apply()`, even though `std::apply` (obviously) can't apply a struct, but `apply()` based on magic\_get can do that and if struct can be converted to tuple, then perhaps `std::apply()` should be able to do that too, right?

Potentially it could be possible to call a function similarly to this (pseudocode++20):

    void g(int x, const std::string &amp;y); // forward declaration
    
    g({ .x = 17, .y = "hello world" });

If `{}` expression can be converted into type-deduced anonymous struct that then can be converted into a tuple (not necessarily named) that in turn can be "unrolled" into compatible function arguments.

I pasted working example (without magic\_get based `apply()`) here: [https://godbolt.org/z/jeatU5](https://godbolt.org/z/jeatU5)

Godbolt can't compile it because of missing includes, but GCC 5/6/7/8/9 can if magic\_get is cloned locally. Note that clang 8 crashes, i didn't check with clang 9/10, but at least clang 7 works too.

To sum this up:

1. This works similarly to structured bindings except it's explicitly typed and compiler do check types during conversions instead of deducing types with `auto`
2. This works in C++14, although it depends on underlying tricks that are not very pretty, readable or maintainable. But it technically works.
3. There are some limitations listed on magic\_get's Github page
4. It's not very pretty overall, namely `decltype()` is all over the place, there are a lot of brackets and so on
5. Nonetheless i think conformant C++14 compiler can already do multiple return values and so to speak "named tuples" (represented as anonymous structs) if some inconveniences and redundancy is ignored
6. It actually synergizes with type deducing and structured bindings

I assume this wheel was already invented elsewhere

1. Are there any related proposals ongoing?
2. Does anyone know what is the status of [P0222R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0222r0.html)?
3. Any chance of getting multiple return values and named tuples into C++, preferably without templates hacks or other kinds of hacks any time soon?

Any ideas?
