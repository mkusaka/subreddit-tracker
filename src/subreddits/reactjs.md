We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

how can i change code so that new state data is returned on one click?

    class Button extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    
        //state
        this.state = {
          variant: "",
          class_name: "",
          mode_class: "",
        };
      }
    
    //this is supposed to call when clicking button from another component
    componentWillReceiveProps() {
        const { className, mode } = this.props;
        this.setState({ class_name: className || "" });
        switch (mode) {
          case "active":
            this.setState({
              mode_class: "atoms-Button-active",
              variant: "primary"
            });
            break;
          case "success":
            this.setState({
              mode_class: "atoms-Button-edit",
              variant: "success"
            });
            break;
          default:
            break;
        }
      }
    
      render() {
        const { variant, class_name, mode_class } = this.state;
        console.log("variant", variant);
        return (
          &lt;ButtonBB
            variant={variant}
            onClick={this.props.onClick}
            disabled={this.props.disabled}
            className={"shadow-none atoms-button" + class_name + " " + mode_class}
          &gt;
            {this.props.children }

Hi,

I am new to front-end and need help designing a table of contents pane which is placed on the right side of a page to easily navigate through it. Something similar to the pane on the right side of this [page](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navs/). Any links to material design/tutorials would be appreciated. If there is an existing react component which I can use directly that would be amazing.
