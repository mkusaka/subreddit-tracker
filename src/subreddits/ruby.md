So ima semi noob in the ruby/rails world, like many before me I rushed to simply skim the basics and start building, but I hit many walls and spent even more time reading than building, that's when it hit me I should just put in the time to simply learn everything right and stop this self-imposed rush I'm in.

Just learned about Procs and Lambdas and I am stuck in the concept of Lambdas and Procs, I understand the syntax and how to build one, but can't for the life of me find practical or real-world applications for when to use these over simply defining a method.

Can someone please elaborate on this plz! Thank you in advance

Hey everyone ✌️

I just want to present you [PoliteText](https://github.com/OpenGems/polite_text), a Ruby Gem that I've created. 

It allows you to automatically remove the swear words (or any words you want) from your users' input.

While I was building [stanza.dev](https://stanza.dev), I needed a way to automatically remove swear words from users' posts and I could not do this work manually by monitoring every posts. So I have built this gem and I hope that you will like it !

Feel free to contribute or to give me feedbacks,

Cheers ✌️

## [4][Promises in Ruby? Particularly in "ruby-concurrency"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jpmb10/promises_in_ruby_particularly_in_rubyconcurrency/)

Gem [https://github.com/ruby-concurrency](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency)

There're some examples in the documentation, but there're so many methods and functions in **Promise**, that it's confusing how to use it at all, and which functions to use and in what cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there simple real examples of how to use Promises, how to chain them, wait for them to resolve and so on?

Or what gem would you recommend instead? A library that's used by many people, yet simple and decent. I don't need a gem that's abandoned or use by few people.

I recently conducted a survey of Rails developers to ask what their biggest testing questions are.

Out of the 8 questions people voted on, "What are the different kinds of Rails tests and when should I use each?" was solidly the top question.

My answer is that you can meet 98% of your needs with just system specs and model specs. I don't really use request specs, helper specs, view specs, routing specs, mailer specs or jobs specs, for various different reasons.

I explain all my reasoning in this post:

[What are the different kinds of Rails tests and when should I use each?](https://www.codewithjason.com/different-kinds-rails-tests-use/)

I would welcome any feedback anyone has. From experienced testers, I'd especially like to know if you disagree, and if so why. From people newer to testing, I'm curious to what extent this answers your questions and if this leaves you with any questions unanswered.

Hope you find the post useful.

**What is it?**

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (Ruby, Java, Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Python,..).

**Motivation**

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.
