 Hi ! I have a question for deep learning practitioners who are familiar with AWS products.

In my workplace, we are assessing two options : using Amazon SageMaker or having an EC2 instance with GPU.

We mainly need the computing power (GPU) and nothing more. We would like to have full control over which version is each package since our app needs specific versions for some packages and won't work otherwise. We are about to train a complex model with many components and loss functions.

Which is more adapted for our case cost-wise and from an ease-of-use point of view ?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Does adding a cache-control to images on my static website increase the costs of hosting?

Seems like an obvious thing but my Google and Doc searching skills are failing me.

On AWS Connect how many times does it ring an agent before it's considered a missed call? What happens when a call is missed... does it try another agent?

Thanks!
## [8][Ec2 with APU ? Or anything that supports directx](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hylt8q/ec2_with_apu_or_anything_that_supports_directx/)

Hi guys
I need to run some tasks that requires directx11
The tasks dont utilise dx11 much- they simply need to meet the dx11 requirement before they can kick in
At the moment, i can run those tasks  with g3 instances but these instances are really expensive so Im wondering if there is anything out there with APU that Im not aware of. 
(I have tried standard instances with elastic graphic but it looks like elastic graphics doest support directx)
Thanks
## [9][Being charged by RDS master KMS key](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hyp58b/being_charged_by_rds_master_kms_key/)

I was testing RDS last week on my personal account.  The service created a master key in KMS to encrypt RDS data.  This key is tagged in KMS console as "AWS managed" and I cannot delete it, although I cannot find anything in CloudTrail using it.  


I am being charged $0.03 daily for this key.  Although the amount is negligible I don't want to pay for something I don't need nor I use.  How can I delete this key?  I already tried reaching support (basic) but they cannot help with this as it is not account/billing related.

Hoping to find someone that's used Greengrass. So my intention is to use it to do some basic edge processing and emit events via mqtt. Now I want the configuration of what triggers the events to be made on the cloud via the device shadow. I'll have only one device on the field per site, so I think I could just get away with using the Core for all my needs, but turns out that the Core doesn't support shadow subscription for some reason. Which means I can't receive an event that my config has changed. Also, I will have one device per site, all running the same lambda but different shadow config. Any tips on the architecture?
Thanks
