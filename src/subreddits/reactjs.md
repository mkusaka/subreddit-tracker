We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I am not asking about languages or tools, but i am a frontend developer and i don't have an idea of what is going in the other side, the side of backend, so why i am asking, can learning firebase give me what i am missing, so it would be easier in the future to learn backend development languages and tools and how they work, Thanks in advance!

when I googled why should one use next.js over create-react app , most of the articles made the point of server side rendering, how next,js use ssr which make the application fast. Now if we implement server-side rendering in CRA, will it performance be similar to next.js !

Hi all so I was just wondering about a job offer I received. I always hear from developers that it is a good idea to just get your foot in the door for your first job and not worry too much. 

What I am not sure about is the fact that I have been studying the MERN stack(React, Express, Redux, NodeJs) for the past 3 years. I know I am not supposed to get hung up on technology as I am willing to learn whatever is best to get a certain task done. 

Would you developers out there recommend that I take a job with a lot of Wordpress and PHP involved just to get started( I can obviously still work on whatever Technologies I want in my spare time) or keep on studying and wait for another opportunity?
