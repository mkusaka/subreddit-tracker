Hey, everyone!

I've been working on a compile-time safe SQL query builder/ORM for quite some time now. I **finally** have a Playground that allows you to execute both SQL and **TS** code to interact with a database! This Playground is SQLite3 only but it's a huge milestone for my project.

https://anyhowstep.github.io/tsql-sqlite3-browser/test-playground/public/

Sorry if the sample code on the Playground is contrived! But I swear the library already has a tonne of features!

There isn't documentation yet and I still have stuff to work on before publishing, but I figured I'd put up a link to the Playground, anyway, in case anyone here is interested!

And here are links to other parts of the project,

I was bored, so I made this music app with the help of `electron` and `react` in typescript.

It can play music out of any directory you choose and can even download songs into that directory. It stores metadeta about each song and shows you all artists and albums which the songs are from and stores youre last queue so you can pickup where you left off.

The project is far from perfect and any suggestions will be welcome.

PS:

 I use linux so I'm not sure if there will be any bugs in mac or windows

Also you require a Napster API key(for music metadata) and a Google API key(for downloading a video) for proper functionality
