I am having a problem with a nested form setup. I have a products model that has product\_options from that model. What I am trying to do is have a button to add a new product option name/value within the product form. I also want to list within the product the current options and be able to delete them if needed. I do not see any form fields displaying though for the product\_options fields. What am I doing worng?

Product model

    class Product &lt; ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :category
      has_many :product_options
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :product_options, allow_destroy: true
      has_many_attached :images
      has_one_attached :main_image
    end
    

Product\_options model

    class ProductOption &lt; ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :product, optional: true
    end
    

product form (product\_options at bottom)

    &lt;%= form_with(model: [:admin, product], local: true) do |form| %&gt;
    &lt;% if product.errors.any? %&gt;
    &lt;div id="error_explanation"&gt;
       &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= pluralize(product.errors.count, "error") %&gt; prohibited this product from being saved:&lt;/h2&gt;
       &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;% product.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= message %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;% end %&gt;

Currently, I use &lt;%= @ places.each do |place| %&gt; within a table to display all records of places that have been created. they order out one after the other, and I am searching for an easy way to list them out one beneath the other on the page. Any ideas? And thank you in advance.
## [5][Attaching a source to customer for payment method with rails &amp; stripe?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hfm4hf/attaching_a_source_to_customer_for_payment_method/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hfm4hf/attaching_a_source_to_customer_for_payment_method/
---
I have a rails app and in test mode I have no problem accepting payments, but in live mode I get an error like "Stripe::InvalidRequestError (A source must be attached to a customer to be used as a `payment_method`.)". I've attached a token to the customer when it is created (see code below), but not sure where else it needs to be.

    customer = if current_user.stripe_id[connected_acct].present?
        Stripe::Customer.retrieve(current_user.stripe_id[connected_acct], {stripe_account: item.stripe_id})
    else
        Stripe::Customer.create({
                    email: current_user.email, 
                    source: token,
                },
                {
                    stripe_account: item.stripe_id,
                })

Confirming the payment intent looks like this:

    payment_method_card = params[:user][:card_id]
     confirm_payment = Stripe::PaymentIntent.confirm(
                payment_intent.id,
                {payment_method: payment_method_card},
            )

---
I have a rails application that uses stripe to handle payments &amp; fees. In test mode my code works well, but when I attempt to move it over to live mode I run into issues. I'm now using production/live API keys, the issue is around confirming a basic intent. In test mode the confirmation looks something like so (where card_brand = 'visa' or 'mastercard' etc)

    payment_method_card = 'pm_card_' + card_brand
    confirm_payment = Stripe::PaymentIntent.confirm(
                payment_intent.id,
                {payment_method: payment_method_card},
    )

This doesn't fly in production and I'm just wondering what parameter needs to be passed to the payment_method attribute in the confirmation. Any/all help is appreciated.

Hi guys,

I currently have numerous sidekiq workers that interact with ActiveRecord to store/retrieve data that is being pushed to via HTTP POST requests to an API Controller.

When I run a health check on my customers' networks, an agent on their system interacts with my API, which  looks in ActiveRecord for records that my sidekiq workers have created, retrieves the commands to run and then sends it back to the agents via HTTP response. As the agent completes each task, it submits an HTTP POST request back to the API, which then stores the data in ActiveRecord. The sidekiq worker obtains this data and updates other attributes within the application.

Since it is not a best practice to store lots of code in sidekiq workers, or even have them run for a long time, what are some other alternatives?

Ultimately, I just need to push a series of commands and get their responses, regardless if it takes 5 seconds or 15 minutes.

Here's an example of what several workers are doing:

`Task.create(command: "ipconfig")`  
`# waits for task.status == "completed" by running continuous task.status calls every second`  
`if task.output.include? "this"`  
   `do this`  
`else`   
   `do this instead`  
`end`  
`Task.create(command: "next command")`  
`# waits for task.status == "completed" by running continuous task.status calls every second`

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hf0te0/solidus_wont_display_images_out_of_the_box/
---
I'm just starting with Solidus, though I do know my way around Rails. I've created a Solidus project on my Mac, and I installed all the required gems as well as ImageMagick through Homebrew.  Both `identify` and `magick` work as terminal commands as my `/usr/local/bin` directory is in my PATH. I've also specified the path to `identify` in the `application.rb` file (I'm guessing it's supposed to go in side the `Application` class). However, none of the images show up in Solidus, and when I try and manually add an image, I get the following error (it's related to paperclip). 

Any help here would be - Google has not been my friend this time. BTW, the same thing happens on both Mac and Windows running WSL (Debian). The error message is shown below:

I can create posts from  [http://localhost3030/posts/new](http://localhost3030/posts/new) and they save to the database. but I get the above error on the \* line below. Also below is how I called user\_path(resource) within a after\_sign\_in method within my applications controller yesterday and it worked. I figured calling the same in my post controller create method would re\_direct to the same route, but it resolved the above error. Any ideas why? And thank you in advance. 

def create

  @ post = current\_user.posts.create(post\_params)

  if @ post.valid?

\*    redirect\_to user\_path(resource) 

  else

render :new, status: :unprocessable\_entity
