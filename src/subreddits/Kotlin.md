[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source web framework created for the Kotlin language. It allows developers to build modern web applications in Kotlin, without any use of HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

I have released KVision 3.0.0. This is a major upgrade bringing a few incompatibilities and breaking changes. Highlights of this release:

* major improvements to the event handling architecture (including new module with support for event Flows)
* new server-side module with full support for the [Javalin](https://javalin.io) server
* upgrade [Jooby](https://jooby.io) to version 2
* important bugfixes and minor improvements for different components

For more details about this release see the [changelog](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision/releases/tag/3.0.0) and the [migration chapter](https://kvision.gitbook.io/kvision-guide/part-1-fundamentals/migration) in the guide. There are also some new example apps with Javalin server in the [examples repository](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples).

As always any feedback is welcomed :-)

Is there any efficient way to update multiple value in MutableList without using for loop

for example my mutablelist is \[1,2,3,4,5,\] and i want to add value at index 2 to 4 with 10, if i used for loop the process would be 

\[1,2,13,4,5\]

\[1,2,13,14,5\]

\[1,2,13,14,15\]

is there a way to update value at index 2 to 4 at the same time ?

This is my favorite feature in Typescript. Does it exist in Kotlin? Is it called something else?
