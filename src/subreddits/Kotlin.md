I want to make a Kotlin GUI application packed into a standalone JAR (or with a tiny EXE that runs the JAR) that runs on Java 8 (the most installed Java version) in order to make using it as easy as possible.

I heard that there are problems with JavaFX in the modern day that requires users to install JavaFX alongside JRE, and I don't want my users to be bothered with this.

So, which GUI technology should I use in this case?

I can't figure out how to get the default Intellij JVM build tool to work, not much documentation on it. Have used Maven for Java - should I switch to Gradle?

I am having an issue with unreachable statement after my return statement. I am using firebase createUserWithEmailAndPassword method but it is unreachable because the code before returns true or false. They are two boolean methods which check if email and password are correct input and then return true or false.

I'm new to Kotlin and was wondering what people preferred to use. Especially interested in anything that supports fat jar for easy deployment.
