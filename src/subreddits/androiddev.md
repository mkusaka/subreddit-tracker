Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Have a question about the subreddit or otherwise for /r/androiddev mods? [We welcome your mod mail!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fandroiddev)

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

Hey all! 

I'm a junior iOS dev that is starting to learn Android Dev due to my workplace wanting me to expand (amazing opportunity, I know!)

now, with iOS there's Xcode and nothing else really compares / is a viable option. In Android there's obviously Android studio, but I was wondering if some of you are using something else? Maybe VSCode? Intelij? 

Looking forward to your opinions and excited to join this community !
