This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Weâ€™re on the engineering team for Android Jetpack &amp; Jetpack Compose, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, August 27**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), focusing on a new topic every week. Weâ€™re excited to close out our [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid) with a focus on UI, and on Thursday weâ€™ll be hosting an AMA on the Android Jetpack and Jetpack Compose!

[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is our suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We launched several new libraries like Hilt for Dependency Injection, App Startup, and updates to Paging, Navigation, CameraX, and more.  Check out the Jetpack updates we made during #11WeeksOfAndroid [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-jetpack.html).

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI - declarative, composable, and more! We just [launched](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/announcing-jetpack-compose-alpha.html) alpha, together with a bunch of new  training materials! Check out our new videos, or dive into our curated [pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose). We are excited to hear your feedback as you try it!

For this AMA, we want to answer your *technical* questions about Android Jetpack and Compose.  No roadmaps :)

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, August 27 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PDT / 4:20 PM EDT.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

I've recently released an app on the play store, after about 8 years our of app development - I used to have a few iOS apps.

I don't remember any app gaining absolutely no momentum on the iOS app store, and I also had a play store app which had around 3500 reviews.

My most recent app, and the old play store app have gained absolutely no momentum whatsoever. 0 downloads. Has the marketplace become so huge in the last 8 years that there just no chance of someone downloading an app on a whim these days? Do I need to pay for advertising, or am I doing something else wrong?

I have a wallpaper app which recently reached 100K downloads on play store. I haven't made any significant amount of money from it so far. The only money i have made is from in app purchases for PRO, only &lt;1% people are buying PRO meaning i am not really making any money from 99% users. I have interstitial ads on the app with eCPM floor of $1 which only makes me only ~$1 a day. I have about 7000 DAU. Most of my users are from South Asia (about 70%). I added Facebook native ads with eCPM floor of 0.25$ but the fill rate is only 7% so i am planning to remove them. Please suggest me better ways to make money from the app or is banner/native ads the only option i have?

So, the dreaded moment has come when we've needed to release a critical fix for our app urgently.

We got the fix out within 2 hours of getting alerted to the issue, only to see it languish in the Google Play Store review process for 24 hours and counting.

Previous couple of updates went through within a couple of hours, but of course it's completely unpredictable when this one will go through. Rolling the Russian roulette whether it's gonna be a few more hours, or a full week, or more...

Also, just so you know - options like making the app unavailable temporarily in all countries, or rolling back to the previous APK or anything like that, will only restart the review process. So, if you're ever in a situation like this, don't touch anything on the Play Console.

My brain can't comprehend why the 2 reps I spoke to, instead of pasting cookie-cutter responses, could not take those 2 minutes to actually look at the release, accommodate an urgent situation and expedite the review. 

I know as devs we're used to taking a lot of crap and rolling with the punches, but when someone makes me feel like I'm writing/releasing software for some 1960s waterfall model with a PHB on top, what's the workaround?

This shit used to be holding up together, and with all the outages and the basic concept of "break-and-fix-as-needed-it's-fucking-software" BROKEN, are we going back in time?
## [11][Where's the flaw in my thinking? If I can spend $100 on advertising my app and get $120 back, what's stopping me on spending $1.000.000 on it to get $1.200.000 back?

## [12][How to design a good looking UI?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ihek53/how_to_design_a_good_looking_ui/)

I am beginner in android development, i have learned (a little) to code the backend but when it comes down to UI i completely suck at it.

 I can't decide what color scheme/ background should i use, how to arrange text views/edit texts so UI will look good.

Do all these things come with the experience? Or there is a way to learn "how to make better UI" (except material design)
