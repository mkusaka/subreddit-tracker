Hey guys I thought I would be really interesting to share this here too!

I wanted to let you know that I Just finished a javascript [free stock API](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/) you don't need any API keys you can test it and get real time stock price, forex crypto, historical data.

You have also access to 1min 5min. 15min 1hour data from stocks, forex.

You will be able to create portfolio, charts, access market data.

Let me know what you think about it.

I did an example in React:

## [9][What test automation tool should I use for a React / Redux webapp that uses MS Oauth2 &amp; another authorization flow on top of that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fdty8c/what_test_automation_tool_should_i_use_for_a/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fdty8c/what_test_automation_tool_should_i_use_for_a/

Hello,

I have reached ''desperate'' status in terms of automation because I can't get passed through the authorization flow. I tried testcafe and and cypress.

Full disclosure: I have limited TS &amp; programming knowledge.

I will explain the app flow: 

1. Navigate to a link.
2. Click on a login with microsoft button
3. You are redirect to [login.microsoft.com](https://login.microsoft.com) and you need to provide an email and password that are part of our Azure AD, you get a client ID, token, all that MS stuff.
4. Then another redirect happens to our authorization flow, this flow provides the client scopes and checks the token, then generates a cookie.
5. After all of this, you are redirected to the link at step 1 /client

My problems with testcafe are that I receive an error during login: 

    Error in fixture.beforeEach hook -
          A request to "our auth link" has failed.
          Use quarantine mode to perform additional attempts to execute this test.
          You can find troubleshooting information for this issue at
          "https://go.devexpress.com/TestCafe_FAQ_ARequestHasFailed.aspx".
    
          Error details:
          Failed to perform a request to the resource at "our auth link" because of
          an error.
          Error: Parse Error

Cypress doesn't allow navigation from a super domain to another, disabling security does nothing. I tried cy.request as well, using google to check if what I'm doing is correct.

I tried a bunch of options for testcafe as well and none of them worked.

When doing the login manually, everything works fine, including in-private mode or on a fresh browser.

Do I have any other options? Any kind of help is appreciated, thank you, and sorry if this is a stupid question.

I recently joined a new team as a front-end developer and still having a hard time adapting to their system. I mainly work on the UI but the way the local environment is set up right now is that I have to pull the backend code in my local and run the microservices and database in my system. I found this to be odd and overhead for a UI developer since I have to run multiple microservices in my local machine and now I have a code in my system that I have no idea what it's doing. Every time I run into some issue I have to call the backend developers and help me troubleshoot the issue.  I spoke to my team lead and boss about pointing the APIs to the higher environment but they disagreed with my approach and they think the current setup is good practice.  I am learning java in order to be able to debug the backend code but I was also wondering if I could get any advice or example of how people run their backend  while working in the UI?

Hey there, I have been working on a React js for past one year now , and currently looking for an authorized certification for React. I want to be a certified react developer and any certification by Facebook or any such authentic company will be very appreciable. I have gone through many online certification by V skills and Edureka, But I did not find them that authentic. Any leads please.
