Hi everyone, I have recently implemented Google Pay in my app for in-app purchases. The success rate is as low as 0.6%.

It definitely differs across geographies. In the US, it's around 1.5% whereas in India, Philippines it is around 0.1%.

Is it the standard? What is the usual success rate you see across other products.

PS: My app is a utility product.
## [10][Best way to cache an external limited API in my backend](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i8xjuv/best_way_to_cache_an_external_limited_api_in_my/)

Hi all,
I'm currently using a rest API from my android app which is limited to X calls for hours. 

Many of these API endpoints return the same object for some days.
I would like to create a backend to cache the API calls every day in order to consume my backend API and solve the hourly limit.

Which services do you suggest me to realize this backend ?
I've no experience with backend caching but I've worked many times with j2ee, spring boot, AWS ec2, firebase (are there better alternatives to ec2 for mobile backend ?).

Thanks a lot

Hi there.   
For the last year I'm developing an Android applications using Redux architecture.  I'm very happy with this approach and I didn't find anything like it, so, wanna share my work with you.  
Maybe this will be helpful for someone!

## [12][How to share live location updates from one client to other client effectively?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i8wof8/how_to_share_live_location_updates_from_one/)

I am making a WhatsApp clone. For normal chatting and image sharing I am using socket io on my client and on my backend and it works perfectly fine and I am using MongoDB with nodejs on my server side. I have already integrated google maps on client side. I have an option for google maps as well where user can continuously share his live location updates to other user with whom he is chatting just like whatsapp. Doing Put request in mongodb everytime user's location change does not seem right to me as I don't want to save this data and it can increase my database cost as well. What kind of backend and client infrastructure do I need to continuously stream this location update. One of my friend recommended me to look into pusher, amazon kinesis,kafka,mq which I don't have any knowledge of . Is this what should I look into or there is some different way of doing this.
