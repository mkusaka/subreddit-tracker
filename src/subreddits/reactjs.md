Hi all!

You might recognize me as the guy who created [radioactive-state](https://github.com/MananTank/radioactive-state#readme) library, It's been slowly gaining popularity. That library was just for local State Management, a replacement of useState hook.

I wrote another library which is a superset of that library for **Global** State Management 

Here is the Repo's readme: [https://github.com/MananTank/radioactive-store#readme](https://github.com/MananTank/radioactive-store#readme)

My goal is to create the **easiest** global state management library and I want your feedback about the current API. What do you like, what you don't like? I am willing to change the API depending on your feedback and also willing to add features.

I would really appreciate if you can help me out.

Thanks ;)

# Introducing [Rex State](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/rex-state) v1.0 

I initially built rex-state as a state management library, however, since it was using the Context API it wasn't very efficient with handling re-renders. 

But then its another feature became more prominent. It can easily convert any hook into a shared state!

Focusing on this functionality, Today I'm releasing Rex State 1.0. This tool is easy to use and will work with your existing hooks.

## Usage
Add rex-state to your project

```sh
yarn add rex-state

# or

npm i rex-state
```

Consider you have the following counter hook Ôπ£

```jsx
const useCounterHook = (initialCount) =&gt; {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount || 0);

  const increaseCount = () =&gt; setCount(count + 1);
  const decreaseCount = () =&gt; setCount(count - 1);

  return {
    count,
    increaseCount,
    decreaseCount
  };
};
```

You can use rex-state to create a provider and a shared hook using the following code Ôπ£

```jsx
import { createRexStore } from "rex-state";

const { 
  useStore: useCounter, 
  RexProvider: CountProvider 
} = createRexStore(useCounterHook);
```

Wrap your application inside the `CountProvider` Ôπ£

```jsx
export default function App() {
  // Starting off with an initial count of 10
  return (
    &lt;CountProvider value={10}&gt;
      &lt;CountDisplay /&gt;
      &lt;Controls /&gt;
    &lt;/CountProvider&gt;
  );
}
```

Now you can use `useCounter` hook inside both `&lt;CountDisplay/&gt;` &amp; `&lt;Controls/&gt;` components. When the count changes in the `&lt;Controls/&gt;` component, it will cause the `&lt;CountProvider/&gt;` to re-render &amp; will also update the `&lt;CountDisplay/&gt;` component.

This is based on the React.Context API. I have written a detailed page on its [performance](https://rex-state.netlify.app/?path=/story/intro-performance--page) &amp; when to use it in your application.

Check out the working [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rex-counter-2m4zy?file=/src/App.js) of the counter app

Read about it detail on [Github](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/rex-state)

Share your thoughts about using this library. I'm open to feedbacks &amp; ideas!

Trying to find a simple example, and improve upon it. It's the best way to learn. Finding the application that's the most well-made and looking at the best practices.
