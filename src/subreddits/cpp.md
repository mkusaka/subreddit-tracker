Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

If I create a recursion function, does it means for each call am I creating new function or overloading the values in called function?

Hi,

I would like to use a static code analyser tool in my team but there are several options to choose from, so I would like to ask you, what static code analyser tool do you use, and how do you like it?

I am more interested in these: Gimpel's PC-Lint, SonarQube, and Coverity.

Thanks

Hi, I am standing in front of C++ IDE selection, I mostly use Windows. At the moment I am using Visual Studio Code, but thought about Eclipse. Which do you like the most? And which would you recommend?
