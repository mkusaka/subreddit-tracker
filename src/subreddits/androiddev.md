This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

## [3][Android dynamic feature modules + Navigation Component is finally solved üòÅ](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/geg22f/android_dynamic_feature_modules_navigation/)

Navigation Component + Dynamic feature was a very painful combination for a long time.  Fortunately, the new 2.3.x version of the navigation library (still alpha) solves dynamic module navigation by introducing `DynamicNavHostFragment` and `&lt;include-dynamic...` tag.

&amp;#x200B;

Check this PR for concrete implementation [https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/pull/98/files](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/pull/98/files) (`NavHostFragment` \-&gt; `DynamicNavHostFragment`)

 We‚Äôve had our app suspended since we sell tobacco products. We were selling tobacco products in a legal and local law complaint way for many years, we warn the user that it is prohibited to sell tobacco to anyone under the age of 21, and we require the driver to check the customer‚Äôs ID when delivering the tobacco products.

Right now we‚Äôre removed all our tobacco products on our app and are trying to appeal the suspension. Google suggests that we reupload the app under a new app and package name, but we‚Äôll be going through the hassle of informing the existing users who have the original to download a new app, and might have to accept that some users will refuse to download the new app.

Since the issue was a content issue, we‚Äôve already taken the measure to remove all tobacco products and this should be reflected on existing users. Is there a chance for us to retain our existing package name and app name?

Anyone who added GDPR compliance to his app, which steps did you take for this? Is it worth the hassle to create a brand of trust?
