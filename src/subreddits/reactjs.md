We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I like reactJS only because it is simple to render a dynamic component but with useEffect it looks like a bloat API and here is why.

useEffect doesn't feel like an API because it is doable without it.

A - example for achieving side effect using react's API  
B - example for achieving side effect without using react's API

Here is a link to image [https://imgur.com/gallery/iCAAhAQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/iCAAhAQ)

By definition of useEffect, it is helps to do changes which causes side effects. But to maintain a component in react, it shouldn't have any side effect. Such function calls should be moved to a utility.

ReactJS is a good framework but things like these is making it bloated. The framework is slick and awesome as it is, but this API sounds like a hype because an API should allow you to do things that is not possible without it but for this use case it doesn't look solid.

I'm asking this question because I'm not sure whether I am misunderstanding something about that API or not.

How to do include(searchtern) on a object with multiple arrays?

Lets say if I have an object with 5 different string arrays containing elements.

How can I in an easy way to an include("string example") on all of them?

I have been using React for a few months now. I have an existing Flask app and I use React within key pages to provide interactive features, but it is not a React app overall. I do this using CDN links for 'react' and 'react-dom'. However, I keep hitting moments at which it would be helpful to import an external react module, but this is only possible through npm, not using CDN links.

Can anybody point me in the direction of a guide or tutorial for someone in my position? I would like to use npm, but a) don't really know much about it, and b) do *not* want to create a full React app, just have react running on a few pages within my existing app. I currently use Babel to compile my JSX into JS files that are included via &lt;script&gt; tags in my HTML.
