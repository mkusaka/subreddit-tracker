Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

I am in the process of building a World of Warcraft addon manager in Rust called [Ajour](https://github.com/casperstorm/ajour/). It is currently supported by macOS and Windows. The main reason I started this project was to take my Rust skills to the next level, and avoid using the bloated Twitch application.

Ajour is nowhere near perfect, but I am doing the best I can. So, if you want to join me on this journey, you are more than welcome. There's features, bugs and properly a lot of places where I do things wrong or suboptimal and I would LOVE to improve.

It's my first proper Rust project, and the journey has been amazing. The Rust community is incredible and I am super grateful to be a part of it. Thanks all.

I've read just about everything I can find comparing these two languages as they seem to be going after a very similar use case, however I feel like there is some missing nuance that experienced developers seem to miss.  To summarize my position, Rust has accomplished something incredible that many engineers who write about it don't seem to understand.

First off, I've been doing Javascript &amp; PHP development mostly in my career (the past 6 years or so) with a little bit of other stuff mixed in (Python, Java, Ruby, etc).  I recently spent about 3 months learning Rust (even [released a library](https://crates.io/crates/no_proto)) and I feel like I've passed from newbie into "kinda knows what's going on most of the time". So everything is coming from that perspective.

On at least 3 occasions in the past several years I've taken a good faith stab at learning C++, a new skill to add to my toolbox, and I've yet to reach a point where I can read a reasonably large C++ codebase and actually understand everything that's going on.  Much less contribute to it.  Admittedly, maybe my brain just doesn't map onto C++ very well and my experience isn't the common one.

From my perspective, there seems to be two variants of C++: one that is defended adamantly as a simple, beautiful language and taught as such in books, then the version that engineers actually use to build software.  The gap between what you're taught as a beginner C++ dev and what you actually need to know before you can start being productive appears to be about 5 years of trial and error or just a few years of being mentored by someone who went through the 5 years.

How is no one talking about this?

The fact that I, essentially a web developer, can write memory safe native software (that competes with C++ on runtime performance) after a few months of fighting the borrow checker is a game changer.

When C++ engineers come back and say "well you can write memory safe C++ if you do X or do Y" the ONLY thing I'm thinking is "great, find me ONE large C++ project that hasn't experienced numerous memory bugs".  If it's so damn easy, why aren't they doing it?  This tells me that even if I invested the 5 years of hell to learn C++ and get good at it, I'm just going to be another guy writing memory bugs acting like I don't.  The worlds best C++ programmers with resources of monster companies like Microsoft still can't write memory safe software with C++.

This kept me from ever diving into C++ fully (before Rust was a thing), because I figured even if javascript/electron apps were slower and more bloated, at least they wouldn't be a security liability for my clients and I.  Rust has opened up a whole new world to developers like me.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't call C++ a bad language or climb on the "rewrite everything in Rust" bandwagon.  It just seems like when engineers talk about C++ they forget what it took to make them competent at that language and further take for granted what Rust has accomplished in opening up this level of software development to developers who don't have years to learn about all the ways you can do memory management wrong.

It's something I'm very grateful for and I think it's worth pointing out.

## [8]["We tested the limited number of utilities in Rust and found them to be of no better reliability."](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/icaf19/we_tested_the_limited_number_of_utilities_in_rust/)

In a paper about fuzz testing (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/paradyn/technical_papers/fuzz2020.pdf), the authors contend that command line utilities have gotten worse over time, rather than better.  More importantly, in the Rust project to replace Unix coreutils, the three programs from the C suite failed in the same way in the Rust versions.

The essential quote is:
&gt; We have updated the basic fuzz tools and testing scripts and applied
&gt; them to a large collection of Unix utilities on Linux, FreeBSD, and
&gt; MacOS. ... We present examples of these failures to illustrate the
&gt; programming practices that allowed them to happen.
&gt;
&gt; As a side note, we tested the limited number of utilities available in
&gt; a modern programming language (Rust) and found them to be of no better
&gt; reliability than the standard ones.


The takeaway from these results are that the "re-write it in Rust" crowd, to which I whole-heartedly belong, has to look closely at what we're re-writing. The C code, whatever its faults, has often been around for decades and battle-hardened against a lot of edge cases that re-writers may not be familiar with.

Hi all,

What is difference in term of performance, stack allocated and heap allocated objects?

As far as I understand, stack is also sitting in heap memory, so how it is expected to be faster then?

More understandable will be to use registers since they are directly in cpu memory, what I am missing?

(Sorry for stupid question)

Thanks for answers

Hello everyone, i recently took an initiative to make 2 blog posts per week in which i talk about lesser known but awesome rust crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io), i pick the crates randomly and select those that the most interesting, i then write a little review on my blog.

First episode: psswd,  A simple Rust command line utility to manage your passwords. It uses [age (Actually Good Encryption)](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt your passwords, and supports decryption using a passphrase.

## [12][Beginner question](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/icm3ay/beginner_question/)

Hi rust community. I'm somewhat of a beginner  and I have a question which I believe may not pertain to rust itself, and maybe this isn't even the best place to ask it, but I figured since I'm writing this code in Rust I might have a chance to get the best answer here. Any help is appreciated and sorry again if this is a very newbie question!  


So, I have a function which encapsulates the whole process of getting inputs from the user and processing them depending on the parameters, returning an object that holds the processed data as such:  


pub fn get\_processed\_data(type: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Data, CmdErr&gt;  


And then I have to call it multiple times for different types, possibly dozens of times:  


let result1 : get\_processed\_data("type1");  
let result2 : get\_processed\_data("type2");  
let result3 : get\_processed\_data("type3");  
let result4 : get\_processed\_data("type3");  
...  


"type1...n" is just a placeholder here, the actual names are different types relevant to my application and they may not follow any pattern that would make this code esily fit into a loop. Plus, if any of the calls fail, I need to skip all the other calls to get\_processed\_data(). What would be the best control flow for this situation? I'd really like to avoid loops here if possible. Any help is much apreciated!
