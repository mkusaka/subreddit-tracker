Should a database driver return a value in a row as an int32 or an int64, would there be a possible issue with storing it in an int? Similarly, would there be a possible issue with storing sql.RawBytes into a pointer to a string? I apologize if my question isn't worded well, and I appreciate any help.

Hi,

If you are looking for a message transformation library written in GO, here it is:

[https://github.com/etf1/kafka-transformer](https://github.com/etf1/kafka-transformer)

You can read from a topic, make a custom transformation and produce or project the message to external system (like redis ou a database), just implement one interface.

Hello all. My process of learning Go has been ongoing and at this point im starting to feel like im getting stuck in tutorial hell. I did Todd Mcleods intro to go about a year ago and really enjoyed that class. Iv since moved in to doing cs50x to get some foundational CS knowledge and am working my way through jon Calhons Web Dev course. I know the old saying "work on any project" but I guess my issue is im not sure where to even begin. 

 At this point I felt comfortable enough to write a small go app at work for simple influxdb parsing but since my job doesnt not necessarily offer too many opportunities to code id like to find a project, opensource or even possibly some sort of contract work to really rely less on courses to continue learning and start implementing some really world solutions.

For context Iv been digging through many oreilly go books and even watched a couple of videos from the Ultimate Go courses to get better familiar with channels and go routines but I also feel that until im met with a task that requires them I wont fully grasp their usage. My day to day revolves around implementing "devops" practices via ci/cd pipelines and working with a java based team to maintain, deploy, and migrate their apps to k8s with more focus on GCP in the near future.

Right now I have go test run through the go-junit-report tool. It reports by directory name. Running gocov does the same thing.

How can I get the results reported by package name?

Something like:
Package name with tests failed skip

------directory with tests failed skip

----------file with tests failed skip and exact lines of code coverage for coverage test passes.

Is there something like this?

Hi guys. I'm have quite a few files that I need to update since the package I'm using was updated and breaks backwards compatibility (this was on purpose) so I'm stuck with updating numerous files to use the new interface. It's actually not that complicated but I'm having trouble reading and updating the necessary lines to use the new interface.

Essentially, I have a func that has this:

```
func foo() {
... some other lines
	if err != nil {
		boo.Doo = doo
		boo.Loo = loo
                ... return
	}
}
```

What I am trying to achieve is this:

```
func foo() {
... some other lines
	if err != nil {
		boo.Doo(doo)
		boo.Loo(loo)
                ... return
	}
}
```

I think the simplest way to do this is to read the lines one by one and then assembling them to an array and if the conditions are met, update the line and then rewrite the file with the updated content. My problem is, I'm having a hard time determining what "character" is the "tab/space" between "boo" and the left edge of the file. Because essentially, I just need to get the value on the right side of the variable assignment so I can use it as a parameter to the new interface. And my problem is, I need to preserve the formatting.

Any ideas on how to do this?
