Hello guys,

I just want to share the recruitment logic I faced lately. I'm very disturbed because of the approach and want to get your ideas.

First of all, I have 27 years of experience in development, and in the last 5 years, I'm developing using GO on a professional level. On the other hand, the company is a fin-tech start-up. They want to hire a senior golang engineer.

After our first interview, they sent me a "task" to complete and they said THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. 

I don't understand what is the logic in this. Do you need to hire someone for this position or not? According to this,  I can deliver the task after a month and it should not be a problem, right?

Anyway, I didn't pay a lot of attention to this because I thought that maybe they want to give a comfort zone to a developer and wanted to have the best output for the task.

The task is about developing a GO Client for their Finance service. HOWEVER, after I start the task, it is really containing so many details in it, and developing is taking not 2, 3 hours may be more than a week if I work full-time and pay attention to architecture creation, logic implementation, tests, coverage reports, lint fixing, documentation and the like. And the weird part is they want me to develop a full solution for the countries they support. Not two or three countries.

I have great suspicion to complete the task. The first thing that popped up in my mind is, they just want to push the applicant to give up on their application. Kind of reject strategy. I wrote my thought to HR and they said that "We hired every engineer in the company in this way".  The second thought is they need to have a GO Client for their system and they are gathering all possible solutions from candidates and they will choose the best one from the task deliveries and reject the candidate. I've had many other conspiracy theories in my mind...

In addition to that, should it be the way to test any applicants' golang skills to hire for the position? How many of you have free time to develop a task for a company to be hired? Will you find any time or energy after work to deliver such a detailed task?

I don't know if I should continue or not. Maybe I should deliver the GO client and send the invoice. :) 

What do you think? Is it a scam or not? I'll be very happy to have your thoughts. 

Thanks

Alright so I have found Go due to a friend recommending it and I must say I really enjoy the static types and a lot of the simplicity Go brings. I'm doing an introductory course on Udemy to learn the basics and will move on from there. In short, I love this language but I'm still at the beginning. 

So here's the plan; I want to build a mobile app and I'm thinking Flutter for frontend, GraphQL for API backend with some DB (not decided yet) and another microservice for SMS integration. Both the microservice and the GraphQL implementation will be based on Go.

Is there anything special to keep in mind when I'm learning and building this? Are there packages and libraries that are new that I absolutely should check out and be aware of?

Since GraphQL and SMS integration will be two different Docker containers on cloud, is there anything I need to learn or take into account for communication between those services? Do I need to make it an API or can the processes call each other directly?

Thanks in advance if you have some good input.

Hi Guys,  
Can you please point out some good resources for interview preparation? I've been coding in Go for about 4 months and have become fairly comfortable with it. I am preparing to give interview in about a month's time, so any good resources that will help me in understanding it better will really help me out. I've googled this, but the articles are a bit beginner level which I already know. I am looking for something like the inner working of channels,  garbage collection, etc.  
So please help with any good resources. Thank You.
