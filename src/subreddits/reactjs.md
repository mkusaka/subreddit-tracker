We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey guys, So I have been wondering the difference in &lt;Redirect&gt; or useHistory hook. I read somewhere in stackoverflow that Redirect uses History hook under the hood. So I want to know what make them of different and which one should be preferred. 

Thanks

## [9][Div made canvas](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j0qrkz/div_made_canvas/)

Hey all, 

I want to do a personal project in react. It would be more of a proof of concept than anything else. The idea is a figma like web app that doesn't use the canvas tag. 

You essentially would land on a page that would let you define the width of the viewport. Once defined, you can drag and drop elements on to created a webpage.

I want to circumvent the canvas tag so the "canvas" or design could be exported as react components. I'm not against the canvas tag if that's possible but from my reading, canvas cannot be serialized to HTML. 

That's why I want to take a div made  approach. I have no plans for complex objects, transformations, etc. I am hoping the performance wouldn't be too bad but ehh, let's find out. 

My question is do you know of any libraries or readings that can help out? I am only finding libs like konva or react-canvas (hasn't been touched in 4 years). The articles I find are about react with the canvas tag, nothing about div made approaches (understandable).

Furthermore, any tips, tricks and recommendations would be awesome. I have made a few websites with react/next but never something this complex. I do however have a pretty solid understanding of JS.

Thanks everyone!
## [10][Can I create a custom hook for a Firestore snapshot listener?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j0qiuy/can_i_create_a_custom_hook_for_a_firestore/)

I currently have two snapshot realtime update listeners set up in a single react component. One to manage movies, and another to manage a movies watchlist. I was wondering if this would be a good use case for creating my own custom hook to handle this? My only concern is that a new listener will be set up every single time the custom hook is used and will not release or cleanup with the component is no longer using the hook. So I have two questions really:

&amp;nbsp;

1. Is this is a good use case for a custom hook to manage this state?
2. Will hook be destroyed/cleaned up when a component using it is destroyed or unmounted?

&amp;nbsp;

Here's my component:

    const MoviesPage = () =&gt; {
      const [movies, setMovies] = useState&lt;Media[]&gt;([]);
      const [watchList, setWatchList] = useState&lt;Media[]&gt;([]);
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState&lt;boolean&gt;(true);
    
      // Subscribe to any changes to the movies collection
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const unsubscribe = firebase
          .firestore()
          .collection('movies')
          .onSnapshot(
            function (querySnapshot: QuerySnapshot) {
              const movies: Movie[] = [];
    
              querySnapshot.forEach(function (movieDoc: DocumentData) {
                movies.push(movieDoc.data());
              });
    
              setMovies(movies);
              setIsLoading(false);
            },
          );
        return () =&gt; {
          // Cleanup subscriptions
          unsubscribe();
        };
     }, []);

      // Subscribe to any changes to the movies watchlist collection
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const unsubscribe = firebase
          .firestore()
          .collection('moviesWatchlist')
          .onSnapshot(
            function (querySnapshot: QuerySnapshot) {
              const watchList: Movie[] = [];
    
              querySnapshot.forEach(function (movieDoc: DocumentData) {
                watchList.push(movieDoc.data());
              });
    
              setWatchList(movies);
              setIsLoading(false);
            },
          );
        return () =&gt; {
          // Cleanup subscriptions
          unsubscribe();
        };
      }, []);
    
      return (
        &lt;div&gt;
          {isLoading &amp;&amp; &lt;span&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;}
    
          {!isLoading &amp;&amp; (
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;MoviesList movies={movies} /&gt;
              &lt;WatchList movies={watchList} /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          )}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    };
    
    export default MoviesPage;

I have been a long time Spotify user and regularly make playlists for different moods, activities or situations. So, I desperately wanted a feature to help me discover new music based on these playlists as well as generate customized ones, so I decided to build one!

Using remixr, you can generate new playlists based on your existing Spotify playlists as well as based on different artists and tracks. You can also fine tune various attributes such as popularity, mood, energy, danceability, etc. to generate the perfect playlist for you!

I hope you enjoy the app and please feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions you might have. The project is also open source and great for first time developers looking to contribute!
