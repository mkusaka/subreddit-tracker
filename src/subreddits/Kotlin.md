I was just playing around with enum classes, and I noticed that you can declare a method inside a enum (please note, not overriding an abstract method, just a adding a regular method) 

sample:

    enum class MyEnum {
        GREEN {
            fun action(): String {
                return "I'm green"
            }
        },
        RED {
            fun anotherAction(): String {
                return "I'm red"
            }
        }
    }

Kotlin has no problem compiling this code, and decompiled bytecode looks okay:

    static final class GREEN extends MyEnum {
          @NotNull
          public final String action() {
             return "I'm green";
          }
    
          GREEN(String $enum_name_or_ordinal$0, int $enum_name_or_ordinal$1) {
             super((DefaultConstructorMarker)null);
          }
       }

However, if I try to call the method:

    MyEnum.GREEN.action() 

I get: \`Unresolved reference: action\`

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a bug in compiler? Should it not compile the these functions in the enum entry? Or there is another way to call the \`action\` function?

Hi All,

I'm learning Kotlin and have a background in C#. I was wondering if there is an IRC channel / Slack / Discord or some other \*active\* community where I can ask questions? I have a background in C# and sometimes Kotlin's syntax confuses me a little.

I'm a beginner. What are some ways to distribute this application that I've written? I know that I can just create a `.jar` file but is there anyway to make an installer or something like that? And how would I go about integrating that into my gradle build?

I am using grade/kotlin/IntelliJ IDEA

I just finished the book ' Head First Kotlin ' and have no prior java experience. However I do have some python and C++ experience.

*Question*  :  I am looking to get started in Android dev. Should I learn Java or just brush up on the abstraction Kotlin provides? Also please include some resources, if you have any, for the same.

Ps: books preferably

Thank you for your time.
