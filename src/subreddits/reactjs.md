## Want Help with your Code?

1. **Improve your chances** by adding a minimal example with [JSFiddle][jsfiddle], [CodeSandbox][code sandbox], or [Stackblitz][stackblitz].
    - Describe what you want it to do, and things you've tried. Don't just post big blocks of code!
    - **[Formatting Code][wiki formatting code]** wiki shows how to format code in this thread.
1. **Pay it forward!** Answer questions even if there is already an answer. Other perspectives can be helpful to beginners. Also, there's no quicker way to learn than [being wrong on the Internet][being wrong on the internet].

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I mainly do MERN work but recently for my personal projects realized I got tired of repeating redundant code for a simple rest api. I researched Firebase and it seems to be a really good alternative, with built in authentication and real-time database. I‚Äôve also heard people disliking it, if so why? Is it a good alternative after all?

Hi everyone,

We‚Äôve created a new headless CMS for Firestore using React and Express. We call it Prometheus!

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/j1z7uj/video/ttmxarjc93q51/player

This was originally created to be our template CMS for the Firestore database, but we have decided that we will gradually add more database support as our needs increase. We would greatly appreciate it if you gave it a try for your next Firestore project!

website: [https://prometheuscms.com/](https://prometheuscms.com/)

Hi.

I've been mostly freelancing so far. I'm looking for open source projects to contribute to. I heard it's a decent way to experience working in a team before I move to a regular job.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything you could suggest me? Ideally, I'd like to work on the website itself, rather than some React-related libraries.

I'm using Cognito for my user authentication and Apollo for fetching the user information from the server.

The problem is I set the Apollo client header at App.js on ComponentDidMount and after one hour token expires when any query or mutation request sends from the client, the server throws token expires.

How to update the token?

Thanks in advance

I am trying to build the Airbnb website to get experience.  I am having an issue with pictures stacking on top of each other.  I am trying to figure out how to directly access them. I have 2 files I imported to the Home file. This is my layout:

function Home() {

&lt;div className="home"&gt;

  &lt;Banner /&gt;  // imported file

   &lt;div className="home\_\_section"&gt;

&lt;Card      // 2nd imported file

src=

title=

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Header/Banner/Body/Footer along with 20 other files.  The Banner should be below the header and the Cards should display below the Banner, but they are stacking on top of each other. How do I directly access the Cards to force them to fall below the banner?
