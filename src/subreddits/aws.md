I've seen some posts about how to set it up but not so much about how to build a web page.

1. Can I embed youtube videos on it?
2. Can I make it mobile friendly?
3. Know any example sites hosted there?

I've used joomla moodle and wordpress but assume those won't work there and I'd have to build a webpage from scratch.

I assume stuff like forums, polls, quizzes and comments wouldn't work there correct?

Any related links?

Thanks!

My platform is a buy and sell and I store user posted ads document on local EC2 server and images on S3 because ads will automatically be deleted after 40 days I use couchbase as DB  integrated with elastic search, everything works fine. 

The Challenge.

What if my EC2 server goes down no issue with restarting it again but what if I lose my all ads data stored locally, there might be a low chance in this case but we can't predict software behaviour. Simply Aae there any steps I can take to protect my ads from data loss when storing it locally?

Thank you,
