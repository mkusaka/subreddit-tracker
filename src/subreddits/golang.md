Hello everybody!

I'm very proud to release the new version of [DevDash](https://github.com/Phantas0s/devdash), which allows you to create very flexible terminal dashboards.

What's the difference with the existing solutions, you might rightfully ask? You can personalize everything: what data you put in the widgets, from where, the color, the placement, and so on.

You can as well use very generic widgets to query yourself the APIs available!

With this new version, you can as well feed your nice dashboard widgets with data from command lines or scripts output, from your local host or from a remote host (via SSH).

The way to handle dashboard configurations has been simplified, too. I still think there is a lot of improvement to be made on that matter, so I will focus on that next.

The performance have been significantly improved, too.

If you like it, don't forget to give a sweet little Github star :)

## [6][The learning resources I'm using for my 100 days of Go which starts this week. Do you have any other recommendations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/gzuxgt/the_learning_resources_im_using_for_my_100_days/)

Starting a 100 days of Go this week which should take me up until September. My resources are the following:

1. [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) This will be what I use to start coding in Go for the first 18-20 days
2. [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) There seems to be a variety of rich content here. I've heard great things about Jon Calhoun's teaching style. This will take up days 20-60 to complete
3. [Web Development in Go](https://www.usegolang.com/) A premium resource by Jon Calhoun. Other than me receiving a massive student discount, I am choosing the course because he is the type of instructor to take time out of his day to help you when things go wrong (according to his course bio). Instead of paying for a tutorial, I'm seeing this as a "*pay for a mentor*" type of scheme. This will take up days 61-70 to complete.
4. Days 70-100 will consist of me commiting normal 9-5 working hours to a web project powered by Go. 

Over those 100 days I will be supplementing my learning by passively reading through [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) along with the [Blue book](https://www.gopl.io/). I understand that the book has some exercises to complete so perhaps I'll do these passively over days 70-100 or just look at the code solutions on Github to see if I understand the code.

**Does anyone else have any superb learning resources?**

Hi all,

I'm looking for a method to measure how long a DNS request takes from Golang, but unable to find out how to measure the time it takes to get back the data.  
Maybe anyone here has an idea ?
## [9][Why can't you declare array in const?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/h04eg2/why_cant_you_declare_array_in_const/)

New to Go, but is it this hard to define a constant array?

So here's a tiny snippet, sorry for formatting if it messes up:  


const (  
x = 3  
arr := \[x\] int{1, 2, 3}  
)

func main() {

.....

}

//Note, "arr := \[3\] int{1, 2, 3}" does not work either. 

The error is const initializer \[3\]int literal is not a constant.

Hi there, I have recently started learning go and was wondering what all projects I could work on as a newbie

&amp;#x200B;

Couldn't find much by googling, hence asking here. Thank you!
