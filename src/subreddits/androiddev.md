The ratings of my games are going down since about end of November 2019. They have dropped from about 4.2 to 3.9 as of today. Does anyone make the same experience? I don't think it's just me, but I think someone is manipulating ratings big time?

While I am scrambling to keep a 4+ rating, I see developer such as: [Three Card Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Three+Card+Games)  5.0/4.8 average rating for their games. Looking at the comments of their games "Word Attack" and "Tonk Rummy Multiplayer", the ratings are clearly fake. If it's not a duplicate (easy to find, just read the comments), it's the same words simply re-arranged in the comments!?

Why is Google not doing anything about that? It's blatantly obvious. Also, now that the rating give the average of the past 3 months, it's easy to manipulate other apps' ratings. Simply bombard them with 1-star reviews for 3 months and their apps will tank.

Anyone else?

## [7][Requirements and obligations when implementing analytics service such as Flurry and Firebase?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/eo2vwy/requirements_and_obligations_when_implementing/)

We are looking to implement analytics service in our apps, but we are worried because of all "data" panic and fear of being striked by Google Bots.   
So say we want to implement Flurry/Firebase/AppMetrica or any other analytic service to learn how users use our app, collect some events and crashes  


Aside from obvious, adding to privacy policy, what else do we need to do? 

Are there any laws? Beside GDPR/CCPA  
Do we need to present dialog to user and ask for consent?  
Do we need to give user option to opt out of data collection?  


Note: We will be collecting only anonymous data, crashes, which functions are used, and generally how users use our app. Non of those collect any personal info, only app related information's like those mentioned above.

## [11][Workmanager Issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/eo1jko/workmanager_issue/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/eo1jko/workmanager_issue/
---
In Android Q there is a definitive issue with WorkManager.  
  
It's noticed on Apps like OneDrive, where 3 sync notifications pop up randomly from time to time.  
Play Music constantly popping up with Syncing at random intervals.  
WhatsApp with Fetching Messages too.  
  
I'm working on an App that uses WorkManager to do background downloading. After the Last android patch, if I downloaded something with my app (testing it day to day) that fired up a WorkManager Task, later randomly it will re-execute said task at random, even though it's cleared when successful (I even force close app from app settings too).  
  
I have looked online, everywhere, and it's mentioned nowhere.  
  
Pixel 3, latest Q.  
  
Can anyone try replicate this please, it's quite a serious issue, I have confirmed it with some people who has the issue with OneDrive, WhatsApp, etc.
