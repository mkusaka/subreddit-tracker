In my app, I have to use custom certificate for making 2 API calls, and default certificate for all other API calls.

&amp;#x200B;

But once I pin custom certificate in Volley RequestQueue, all the subsequent calls with default certificate are failing with SSLHandshakeException.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I do this?
## [9][Question about minSdkVersion and Play Store publishing](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fl87wq/question_about_minsdkversion_and_play_store/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fl87wq/question_about_minsdkversion_and_play_store/

Let's say that I have an app currently published with minSdkVersion x.

&amp;nbsp;

If I publish a new APK with versionCode incremented (+1000) and  minSdkVersion y, where y &gt; x, will distribution to devices on the Play Store be like this:

&amp;nbsp;

- devices with Android version with API level &gt;= y  get the new APK installed for new installs. And existing installs of the old version are upgraded to the new APK
- devices with Android version with API level &lt; y  get the old APK installed for new installs. And existing installs do not get upgraded to the new version

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short: I have an app minSdkVersion 14 but need to make a specific version for API 29+ (Android 10) devices.

Friends,

I have been searching full-time for an entry-level Android Developer role for the last few months. I left my career in mechanical engineering (8+ years) to pursue this new field, but it has been very difficult to get any traction. I (barely) failed the Google interview as I attempted to do it both Java and Python. A foolish mistake. I have an app released on the Play Store and a solid resume. I have penetrated into the final round of interviews multiple times with a few companies, however they want more experience even at the junior level. I am supporting my family on savings from my previous career and time is running out. I don't know what else to do ...

Do you know any "feeder" programs that accept new grads (or career change like me)? I realize that Amazon, Facebook, etc. have similar interview styles to Google. I'm tentative to start those due to a one year penalty if I fail. Also, smaller companies are preferred as one the reasons I left mechanical engineering was the mind numbing slow pace of corporate giants.

There must be something out there I am missing. I have talent, an app in the market, and a decade of engineering experience.

Any thoughts for an increasingly nervous new developer?

I was following [this tutorial on splash screens](https://android.jlelse.eu/right-way-to-create-splash-screen-on-android-e7f1709ba154), and my app keeps throwing a `NotFoundException: Drawable com.example.ktest:drawable/splash_background with resource ID #0x7f070077`. There seems to be something wrong with this part of my `res/values/styles.xml`:

    &lt;style name="SplashTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar"&gt;
    &lt;item name="android:windowBackground"&gt;@drawable/splash_background&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt; 

This `res/drawable/splash_background.xml` file definitely exists in that directory, and is [exactly the same as the tutorial file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnkitSinhal/SplashScreen/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/splash_background.xml). If I change the value to `@drawable/ic_launcher_background` I get the a working splash screen (albeit with a different image).

I've cleaned the project to regenerate [R.java](https://R.java), I've invalidated the cache, and I'm out of ideas. What's causing this problem?
