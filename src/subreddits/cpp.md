Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

There had been a couple of problems raised few years ago in regards to parallelizing the compilation process in modules being necessarily harder.


Since then, what happened? Any significant design changes merged to C++20 modules to tackle the problem raised?


Or do people that were pessimistic back then still think modules will be dead on arrival?

For containers allocating potentially large continuous blocks like *std::vector*, *std::string*, *abseil::flat_hash_map* etc it would be useful if the container could inquire the allocator about the actual amount that was allocated. If using 2MiB and 1GiB huge pages it's easy to waste a lot of space if the container is not aware of the actually allocated space or the block size of the allocator. Has there been any previous discussion on this?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fqgp03/handling_c20_modules_in_classic_linux_package/

Hi,

I've asked (approximately) the same question on StackOverflow a few months back, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59598282/how-would-linux-package-managers-handle-c20-modules). But I didn't get a conclusive answer and the problem is starting to bug me again.

Anyway. C++20's modules are dependent on the exact version of the compiler they are using. You can't use modules built by GCC on clang. And you can't use modules built by GCC 9 on GCC 10.

I find this requirement quite troublesome as a library author. Let's say there's a library \`awsomecpp\`. Currently packaging is as simple as putting the .so file and headers into a directory, specify the dependencies and launch the packaging process. And distributing pre-built packages are the norm. But with C++20 modules. We have to specify which exact compiler the package depends on, which forces us to built at least two binary releases, \`awsomecpp-gcc\` and \`awsomecpp-clang\`, on most distros. Also as now libraries depends on the exact compiler version. Updating the compiler forces the entire system to download all libraries that are using modules. I don't see this is viable.

There's also problem if we ditch binary releases and stick with source packages (package all the module definition and implementation units). Then everything depends on \`awsomecpp\` have to be compiled on the user's system, it gets worse if \`awsomecpp\` is a luge library and takes forever to compile. Effectively turning every distro into Gentoo or AUR. Which isn't a good solution either.

I think I must be missing something. My conclusions are horrible yet I can't see where I'm wrong. Is there a solution?

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** English isn't my first language. Sorry for the grammar mistakes.

To start off, I'll share mine first. When I use parallel for loop, after processing each element in the vector, I store them in another result vector which I have to guard with a mutex. I was processing image files. So this present 2 problems for me: images are loaded out of order and a mutex limits parallelism.

Before the solution, my implementation in pseudo-code

```
vector&lt;string&gt; files;
vector&lt;image&gt; results;

parallel_for(s: files) {
  image img = load_image(s);
  take_mutex();
  results.emplace_back(img);
}

```
My solution is to assign the loaded image back to the vector element member. This way, my user images are loaded in order and no mutex.

```
struct img_obj {
  string file;
  image img;
};

vector&lt;img_obj&gt; objects;

parallel_for(o: objects) {

  o.img = std::move(load_image(o.file));

}

```

Hi! I cannot get CCLS to say anything from command line. I've tried to run it in verbose mode, but it outputs no debug information as well. It is installed correctly and starts fine in a docker alpine container. Here's the Dockerfile for that:

```
FROM alpine:edge
RUN apk add alpine-sdk cmake make clang clang-static clang-dev llvm-dev llvm-static \
    &amp;&amp; git clone --depth=1 --recursive https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls \
    &amp;&amp; cd ccls \
    &amp;&amp; cmake -H. -BRelease -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    &amp;&amp; cmake --build Release --target install

RUN apk add alpine-sdk clang llvm
WORKDIR /root
```

And here's what happens when I try to run it: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10388889/77822222-b8b04380-7116-11ea-8b68-f95931f38705.png

Has anyone worked with stdin/stdout mode from terminal in CCLS directly? How do I get CCLS to speak anything? It should've responded with a JSONRPC message saying `Invalid data` in the above screenshot, but it didn't.

Hello.  Occasionally, the temptation to try something new leads to the appearance of my new projects on GitHub. Today I'd like to share one my new client library for Redis in C++. I'd really appreciate your feedback.
