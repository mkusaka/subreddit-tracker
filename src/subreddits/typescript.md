## [2][Using redux-saga with Typescipt](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/evg6rd/using_reduxsaga_with_typescipt/)

I've been using `redux-thunk` for quite a while on a project of mine, but I've recently outgrown it and have turned to other libraries to handle async actions (mostly network requests). Of the options out there, I've found `redux-saga` and `redux-observable` to be the most promising options. After some research, I found that `redux-saga` seemed the best for my use-case. 

I then installed saga and the accompanying types, but I quickly found that saga's integration with TypeScript was less than ideal. For example, using a selector returns an `any` type as opposed to the proper type which corresponds to the output of the selector.

I did some follow-up research on this topic, and from what I can see, saga doesn't support this kind of type safety -- something that `redux-observables` does support. Is there some kind of work-around or alternate `@types` library which allows saga to support real type safety with TypeScript? 

I was excited to use saga, but if proper type checks do not properly work, I will be forced to use `redux-observable`.

I am searching for JavaScript/TypeScript senior dev who can share some Best Practices and answer some of my questions. I can surely pay you for it :)

Topics:

1. Runtime type checking, best practices for JSOn parsing
2. Shared code for server/client apps (interfaces, enums, locales)

Medium (or similar) articles are too basic...

## [10][TS2741: Property 'limitToLast' is missing in type 'FirebaseFirestore.Query' but required in type 'firebase.firestore.Query'.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/eua5yw/ts2741_property_limittolast_is_missing_in_type/)

    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.CollectionReference.html#where
    where
    where(fieldPath: string | FieldPath, opStr: WhereFilterOp, value: any): Query&lt;T&gt;
    
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.Query.html
    firebase. firestore. Query &lt; T &gt;
    A Query refers to a Query which you can read or listen to. You can also construct refined Query objects by adding filters and ordering.

I think .where() should return firebase.firestore.Query based on the above. Can someone tell me why this is not the case or what else may be causing the type error below?

    import {DocumentTarget, RecordTypes, WhereDefinition} from "../../../shared";
    import admin, {firestore} from "firebase-admin";
    import firebase from "firebase";
    
    export default class FirestoreConnection {
      public async getSome(collection: string, whereClauses: WhereDefinition[], limit: number, orderBy: string, offset: number): Promise&lt;object|boolean&gt; {
    // TS2741: Property 'limitToLast' is missing in type 'FirebaseFirestore.Query' but required in type 'firebase.firestore.Query'.  index.d.ts(8156, 5): 'limitToLast' is declared here.
    
        const baseQuery: firebase.firestore.Query = this.database
          .collection(collection)
          .where("storeId", "==", this.shopDomain);
