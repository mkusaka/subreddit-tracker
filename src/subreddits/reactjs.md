Nowadays, building a subscriptions based SaaS app requires plenty of features such as user authentication, billing management, email verification, trial expiration reminders, etc. These take away the required time to actually focus on building your product. A boilerplate will save weeks and even probably months of dev time since most of us here mostly work on side projects after returning home from a full time job.

I found some implementations for my tech stack online. One was Divjoy and the other was [usegravity.app. ](https://usegravity.app/)I noticed that usegravity had most of the features I was looking for but at a starting price of $500, I felt I should go ahead and build my own. Divjoy is also a pretty solid boilerplate but lacked majority of the features I was looking to have.

I believe that a community driven approach is the best case here. If we have a solid starting base that everyone can contribute to, it will help free the time for more important work to be done and hopefully even bring more cool products to market. One can imagine a variant of the boilerplate using Mailgun, while another using Sendgrid for email deliverability for example, or one using a Node.js backend with another using Flask.

I've started the work and it's about 70% completed. The remaining 30% is in relation to security, email template design and webhooks for stripe and of-course, unit and integration tests.

I'm looking to the community to contribute to bringing this project to life or if you have any feature requests at all or general questions at that. If you're not sure if you have a question, ask yourself; If I was to have anything in the world that I wanted in a project, what would it be?

I'm using this to gauge interest and collect early testers of the project. If you are eager for me to release the project as soon as possible, please help me gauge interest here:

## [8][Using React Router how would I change the navbar style on different routes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h857dn/using_react_router_how_would_i_change_the_navbar/)

Hi there, fairly new to React Router. I have the following setup:

    function App() {
      return (
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;NavbarDefault /&gt;
          &lt;MainSwitch /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    }

And `MainSwitch` as follows: 

    const MainSwitch = () =&gt; {
        return (
            &lt;Switch&gt;
                &lt;Route exact path='/' component={Home}&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
                &lt;Route exact path='/login' component={Login}&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
                &lt;Route exact path='/signup' component={Signup}&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
                &lt;Route exact path='/pricing' component={Pricing}&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
                &lt;Route exact path='/dashboard' component={Pricing}&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
                &lt;Route path="*"&gt;&lt;NotFound /&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;
            &lt;/Switch&gt;
        );
    }

When I route to `Dashboard` I want to change the Navbar style. What is the best way to go about this? Should I try nested routes? Or write a higher order component for route that toggles a context switch?

Hi

Lately I'm learning how to work with quite advanced dnd (something like page builder). I'm looking for materials that can help me how to do the dnd system like in this [website](https://grapesjs.com/demo.html).

Do you know any articles or projects that can help me with that?

I'm not exactly sure how to phrase this, but I don't understand React testing. I come from testing Rails where I make tests for the model, and I make tests for the controller. With the model, I want to make sure the object saves correctly, and with the controller, I want to make sure the API acts correctly.

With React... I'm super confused about what I'm supposed to test. 

Let's say I have a form, and the form lets a user sign in. When they enter their email into the email field, it updates the email state, etc. etc. When the user clicks submit, it will do an API request to the server, which will return a token, is stored in LocalStorage, and then call the callback from the parent to update the signedinstate that is passed to children components (I'm not using Redux).

What am I trying to test? I want to test state but have found... Issues with trying to do so (when using hooks) and have read that state isn't meant to be tested? Maybe testing error messages show on the page (like invalid email)? But that seems small to what really matters in the component, the state changing, the API request, the token being set, and the callback to the parent.

What am I actually trying to test with React tests? Is it purely DOM stuff?
