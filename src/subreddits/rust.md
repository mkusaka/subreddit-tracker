Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/guo4c1/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Welcome once again to the official /r/rust Who's Hiring thread!

Before we begin, job-seekers should also remember to peruse [the prior thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/g6v98u/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

This thread will be periodically stickied to the top of /r/rust for improved visibility. The thread will be refreshed and posted anew when the next version of Rust releases in six weeks.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting (adapted from /r/cpp's jobs thread).
# Rules for individuals:

 * Don't create top-level comments; those are for employers.
 * Feel free to reply to top-level comments with on-topic questions.
 * I will create a stickied top-level comment for individuals looking for work.
 * I will create an additional top-level comment for meta discussion.

# Rules for employers:

 * To find individuals seeking work, see the replies to the stickied top-level comment; you will need to click the "more comments" link at the bottom of the top-level comment in order to make these replies visible.
 * To make a top-level comment you must be hiring directly; no third-party recruiters.
 * One top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
 * Proofread your comment after posting it and edit it if necessary to correct mistakes.
 * Please base your comment on the following template:

COMPANY: *[Company name; please link to your company's website or careers page.]*

## [6][Publishing WASM packages to npm for use by nodejs as well as web(pack)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/h85a9n/publishing_wasm_packages_to_npm_for_use_by_nodejs/)

Is  it possible to publish a single npm package using `wasm-pack` for both  nodejs and browser environments? I have written a rust library that does  not depend on browser or native APIs so `wasm-pack` build can create  packages for either of the targets. But the glue code for nodejs uses `fs`  and the glue code for bundler doesn't create CommonJS modules, so the  generated pkg  only works for one platform at a time.

If  this is not possible, and I need to maintain separate packages for node and bundler/web targets, what is the usual way to use wasm-pack for this?  I'm very new to the ecosystem. TIA!

Looking at adding a "systems programming level" language to a higher-level general purpose programming language that I already know, should I learn Rust or C++?

I feel bad about not learning Rust since it's very new, everyone loves it, replaces the previous two, but I'm not sure if it will be as big and important as the others, and I want to learn the one that is going to kind of "shape the next technology" kind of language.

Edit: I'm interested in Systems Programming in the way of "learning and building small systems from scratch". I also heard machine learning is a new trend and that these languages create the core of ML libraries, so why not consider this as an extra goal!

Hi

Since the library provides drawing primitives (as well as opengl primitives), event-handling and an event loop, I thought I'd write a simple demo game.
