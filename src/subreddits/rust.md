Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering whether some of you felt similarly. I really enjoy learning Rust. I use it pretty much exclusively for my personal projects and I feel my understanding of the language and its idioms increases with each project. That was until I started working on an implementation of a linked list to better understand RefCell and friends. To this end, I read [https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/), and at chapter 'A Bad Safe Deque', I got to a point (Iter and IterMut) where I feel really discouraged. I'm not sure I'll ever get to a level where I can reason like the author does in 'Iteration'. Holy moly, the compiler errors are dense and intimidating. Has anybody else been there and how did you overcome it? Just table more advanced topics and accept that this process takes time to fully master?

Not trying to cry on your guys' shoulders but looking for a little guidance...

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,

Hello Rust community!

Rust LATAM is the conference working on growing the interest around Rust in Latin America; the next iteration of the conference will happen in **Mexico City on May, 22nd-23rd 2020** ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

Rust LATAM is not only a conference, it's a community event and that means that is made by **YOU** all participating and spreading the word ðŸ’ª

The Rust LATAM team has opened the "Call for Papers" for the next LATAM2020 conference. We are accepting proposals for talks (or, if you have a âœ¨ cool idea âœ¨ for workshop, feel free to submit that, too!). So, get involved and get your chance to show something about your project, your experiments, a new development or about an aspect of Rust that improved your life as a developer (or not as much as you expected!).

Do you have in mind a talk not strictly technical? That's great, we'd love to hear from you, too!

Submit your proposals at [https://cfp.rustlatam.org](https://cfp.rustlatam.org)

Are you a company working with Rust? Do you want to get in contact and support the conference? Contact us for a sponsorship opportunity at [sponsors@rustlatam.org](mailto:sponsors@rustlatam.org)

The conference is made by and for the community, so don't miss this opportunity, save the date and take part to Rust LATAM 2020: help us make it happen! ðŸŽ‰

Check out our website [https://www.rustlatam.org](https://www.rustlatam.org), it will be updated as we will be getting closer to the conference.

Follow us on Twitter @ RustLatamConf or join our Discord channel at: [https://discord.gg/b6MBzy](https://discord.gg/b6MBzy)

See you there!
