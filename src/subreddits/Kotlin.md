I think it's safe to say that for Java developers who have been working in the JVM ecosystem, their knowledge of Gradle pretty much carries over when they switch to Kotlin. However for a developer like me, coming directly to Kotlin from other languages with more streamlined toolchains, getting to grips with Gradle is a little bit challenging.

Most resources I've found *kind of* assume you know the toolchain so they don't bother showing what's under the hood in the recipes they discuss. As a server-side developer who's used to automating everything regarding testing, CI and deploying artifacts I feel a strong need to understand Gradle so that I can be confident in creating productive workflows. So I want to ask the Kotlin community for any resource recommendations that'll help me in this endavour.

P.S. I think, official and community generated Kotlin content could benefit by paying attention to this topic for onboarding developers that are coming from other server-side languages.

Watching the Kotlin 1.4 event today about [coroutines](https://youtu.be/E5bje5HgKs0?t=502) they were talking about SharedFlow and I wanted to try it out but I am already targeting 1.4 and it does not appear to be available in it. Is there some opt in that I need to add in my gradle file or something to be able to try it out?

I'm a beginner in Kotlin and I was wondering if I can find some tasks to practice on, I searched a lot but I didn't find one direct task,

I need the task to be like "make a console application that does ........etc"

if you can help me please I would appreciate it

Hello there,

I recently took an assignment to write a benchmark and I decided to trace Kotlin coroutines. However I am unsure where to actually start. What I'm interested in is memory consumption and cpu overhead during some heavy operations (and edge cases like launching 10000 coroutines in sequence). I'm looking for some suggestions/advice on how to tackle this issue.

Right now I'm trying to use `ManagementFactory` from `java.lang` with `threadMxBean` and `memoryMxBean` to list used memory before/after and cpu time. I don't know if there's a better approach though and would like to hear your opinion. Also I would like to know at which parts of the flow should I inject my monitoring code to actually get some relevant data (I mean, it cannot be before and after only since it will probably already be garbage collected).

Any advice is much appreciated.
## [9][Kotlin Online Event Opinion: I found Roman Elizarovs Talk a bit "concerning"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/j9xzp4/kotlin_online_event_opinion_i_found_roman/)

I suppose a lot of you guys have also attended today's online event (What is "KOE"?). The last speaker, Roman Elizarov, talked about the future of Kotlin. And to make this clear from the beginning: I find the decisions he presented very reasonable and understandable. And yet, I find the implications concerning. Let me go into detail:

- The decorator pattern was proposed as a (I admit, very beautiful) solution to the multiple receiver problem. But it's not one of the community-proposed syntaxes. Rather it resembles annotations very. Personally I don't like that because 1. There are already actually annotations, this could lead to confusion and 2. Annotations are probably the number one reason why Java is so bad nowadays. They're abused as metaprogramming tools, creating entire DSLs inside the annotation ecosystem (see SpEL), and all that just because Java isn't expressive enough. Annotation Metaprogramming causes a negative feedback loop in the language development, because a lack of expressiveness in Java causes the rise of annotation abuse, which in turn renders expressiveness in the main language (Java) unneeded. I was pretty that Kotlin uses annotations merely as (documentation) markers and solves every other problem with its own unique features. I really don't want Kotlin to take the same way downhill as Java

- The Ternary operator proposal was promptly rejected, even though it (or any slight variation of it) would really significantly cut down on the expression length. I think it is worth to spend some time trying to find a good alternative

- After the talk, Roman answered a question about reifying typeargs in classes ([a topic which is very important to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hexe8l/discussion_do_you_think_this_would_be_a_cool/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)). He just answered that only the use cases matter, which makes me think the Kotlin team isn't very keen on implementing this feature, but rather other features covering the most relevant use cases.

Now as I said before, I think these choices make a lot of sense for the majority of users and use cases. But my concern for the future is that the development of Kotlin will be, as opposed to how it has been, "use-case first" and instead of introducing new, innovative features, common patterns will me used to solve one specific (and popular) use case. And well, I can understand why this is happening. Kotlin is growing, and as it does, practical usability becomes more important than core values like non-invasiveness and innovation. Generally speaking, this is a good thing. Kotlin becomes more relevant to bigger and bigger companies, it becomes more "mature". But personally I fear that this could be the first step on a path leading to a huge, monolithic and inflexible language like Java, and I really don't want this. There's a good reason that I prefer Kotlin over Java.

But enough talk from me, what are your thoughts on this? Do you think Kotlin's innovative design and genuineness is at stake in the future? And do you think that the development of a more pluggable compiler could have a reasonable effect on this issue?

So I already know Java and working on it for 5 year. 

Now I am transining to Kotlin and all I hear is "Kotlin for Android". I know this is easy and kind of language which reduces the code base of app and main Null Pointer.

But why so much for Android and not anything else. I worked on Spring boot and want to convert whole Rest API in Kotlin. 

Let me know what is reason if there is any to become very good language for Android development and not for other kind of S/W and web development on Java.
