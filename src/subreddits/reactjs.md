We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [3][Error handling w/ Apollo Client x React is a nightmare.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gls732/error_handling_w_apollo_client_x_react_is_a/)

This if my first project using Apollo. Its great, apart from the error handling. Thereâ€™s always some â€˜Unhandled Rejectionâ€™ crashing my app. Iâ€™m setting up basic user authentication and itâ€™s a pain to handle these expired tokens. For every problem I solve, it seems to create another. 

Iâ€™m using apollo-error-link and trying to set up basic default handling in there. 

Am I just being a noob or is this a common sentiment?

So I whipped a little lib over the weekend with the purpose of generating docs from typescript declaration ASTs. I have a video demo of the thing here: https://youtu.be/WBqEIAFfxw0

At this time, I'm solely posting to gauge interest in a tool like this. I don't necessarily know if there is an audience for this so I'm sharing before polishing.

Let me know if you'd using something like this. Feedback appreciated!

## [11][Fireact â€” The open source project for you to fast track your next web app with Firebase and React](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gm11lc/fireact_the_open_source_project_for_you_to_fast/)

Hi All,

I have created an open-source project, Fireact, to demonstrate how React works with Firebase. The idea is that it will help developers to fast track projects by skipping building user sign-in and user functions (e.g. update password). It's a fully functional web application now. Would love to hear feedback and get help to work on it together.

More details here: [https://medium.com/@chaoming\_li/fireact-the-open-source-project-for-you-to-fast-track-your-next-web-app-with-firebase-and-react-5ab98dcf9c93?source=friends\_link&amp;sk=e3a224c2033a504d82d45dc7be7b3177](https://medium.com/@chaoming_li/fireact-the-open-source-project-for-you-to-fast-track-your-next-web-app-with-firebase-and-react-5ab98dcf9c93?source=friends_link&amp;sk=e3a224c2033a504d82d45dc7be7b3177)

Hi reactjs community!

Iâ€™m a computer science student from berlin and part of a research project where we want to understand how project management tools are used in software-development teams.  
That is why I am asking you: What are your opinions on the tools you use? Help me with my research by filling out the survey below!  
Thank you!
