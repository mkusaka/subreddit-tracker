In this tutorial, I'll show you how easy it is to build a web application with Go and the Gin framework and add authentication to it.

I write a tcp/udp port forwarding/reverse forwarding tool and hope it's useful for you :)

Iâ€™m trying to find a framework that allows me to define and parse network packets. Does anyone is working on or using one?

We use nginx exclusively. We compile modules such as LDAP [https://github.com/kvspb/nginx-auth-ldap](https://github.com/kvspb/nginx-auth-ldap)

It works but was wondering if there was a golang service which handles authentication and gives the request back to nginx. I like golang service because its a single binary.

Hi folks, forgive me the question but I am very n00b.

I would like to properly dockerize a sample Go application (just a server for now listening on port 80 and displaying a message). 

I decided to try the multistage build approach inside Docker, so I build everything in a official golang image, then I switch to `scratch` and copy just the compiled binary, using it as `ENTRYPOINT`.

I began though to have some "File not found" errors, so I realized - at least I think - that some dependent libraries were missing. 

So I began to search if there were some proper `go build` parameters that could help me build a self-sufficient binary; but I found very contradictory statements about some environment vars, [workarounds](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9344) that depend on the version used, ...

So, for specifically version 1.13 of Golang, which is the correct way to build the executable into the container so I can just copy it into a blank image?

I've made a microservice which checkout go repos and scores the PRs (using github api) based on GoReportCard.

Here is the readme for [README and Examples](https://github.com/gogitops/gogitops-examples) for running it against your own PRs.

I've been just developing this in my spare time and hosting it on gcloud at the moment.

Looking for feedback and opinion :) 

**Example Curl**

curl -X GET \\ 	https://gogitops.beau.cf/submit/$(GITHUB\_REPOSITORY)/pull/$(PR\_ID) \\ 	  
-H 'apikey: RlqchS8EnQ7edvgyNTLIaAdC2yncRQ8v'

**ofcourse theres no warranty or guarantee of service.**

Will there be an official go standard gui framework? Like tkinter is for python.
