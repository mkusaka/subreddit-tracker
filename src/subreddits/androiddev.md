This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Anything you're glad you did? Anything you wish you did? 

For example, one thing I wish I did in my previous apps was put in the ability to force updates since 1.0.0. Another good one is good analytics. Any other good ideas? We are releasing next month and just want to think of anything that could be beneficial.
## [8][How to create our own LiveData in Android?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gqagbq/how_to_create_our_own_livedata_in_android/)

This question was asked to me in one of the Android Engineer interview. I, then being a fresher, was palm-faced to face this unexpected question. What should be the best approach to create LiveData (let's assume there's no LiveData or architecture components)? Sorry if this question seems quite wide but I was a noob then and didn't ask for counter-questions like what are we given apart from it. I just need some pointers for this.

Reading the "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin in quest of improving my programming skills. Currently in Chapter 2 - Functions.
So, my question to all fellow programmers in different stages of their programming career is, "How long do you think a function should be?"
Thank you!

Considering the increasing number of Android phones out there without Google Play services, and that big players like Tinder and Fortnite already moved to ditch Google payments or Google Play entirely.

.. I was wondering if there might be some new clever app payment platforms coming up? Heard of any? 

Or put in another way, how would you go about providing non-Google dependent in-app purchases?
