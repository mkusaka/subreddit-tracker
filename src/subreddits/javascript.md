**B)** What's the "gotcha" of working full remote ? (not getting paid, or sending code before getting paid, working from Canada in the USA etc how it's all handled ?)

**C)** Do you believe it's possible to build a solid stable career in Javascript only or mostly only JS without going the Java or C# path ?
