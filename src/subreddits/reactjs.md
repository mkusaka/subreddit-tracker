We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I'm creating a really big react native app (and will probably also create a web version). What should I use? What's better in the long run? 

Please explain your answer in the comments, thanks in advance!

I recently delved into Jest and Enzyme to start testing my React apps, and I'm curious about the struggles that other React developers face while testing. 

What are some issues you've faced while using the testing tools currently available for React? E.g. limitations of Enzyme's shallow wrapper or snapshot testing, any aspects of React that are hard to test satisfactorily, etc.
