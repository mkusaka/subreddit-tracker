Hi everybody so I am studying currently front end for 6 months and I just realized should I do higher education ? I have done only high school and I am 22y old and I really regret it I didn't go further but I had to go work when I been 16 because of my situation.. anyway I am thinking should I do a college at least ? How do you guys would react if you would see somebody in CV he finished only high school..?  I am proper embarrassed of that and when the day will gonna come when I will have to write CV should I just leave the education blank ? Or just be honest and out high school there ? Or maybe not do CV at all and just email companies and just send them my portfolio website ?
The problem is I have 2 kids and I don't know if will be worth to go to that collage at least for 2 years or I will be fine with high school?
Sorry for long post and my English but I will appreciate any answer ..
