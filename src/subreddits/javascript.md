I'm looking for a self hosted headless cms solution and I think Strapi cms would suit my needs. As I see the team is active and continuously releases new versions, but it's still in beta. Does anybody have any experience with it or have other suggestion?

My requirements:

* GraphQL support
* API level authentication
* self hosted
