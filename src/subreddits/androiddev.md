Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

After my app got removed from the google play store I submitted an update 14 days ago.  
I know that it currently takes longer due to the current situation, but 14 days??? Cmon...  
I'm loosing so much money throught that.  


Does anyone has a similar situation?

Hi everyone, I want to know how to combine Side Navigation Drawer and Bottom Navigation Bar. I have tried the accepted Stackoverflow answer but it didn't work. If anyone can point me in the right direction, preferably a repo or code for XML and Java(not Kotlin) class. 

Thanks in advance.
## [10][Calendar Provider does not return latest data. What am I missing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fu86hq/calendar_provider_does_not_return_latest_data/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fu86hq/calendar_provider_does_not_return_latest_data/
---
I am using the following code:

`String selection = "((dtstart &gt;= " + now + ") AND (dtend &lt;= " + endTime.getTimeInMillis() + "))";Cursor cursor = context.getContentResolver().query(Uri.*parse*("content://com.android.calendar/events"),*PROJECTION*, selection,null, null);`

And I notice  that once I add a new event to Google Calendar and run the above code immediately, occasionally I do not get the latest dataset from the ``Cursor``. I have to manually refresh the Google Calendar app to get the latest data.

Am I missing something? Or is there another approach that I am not aware of?

I have experienced a drop in downloads of around 60-70% and revenue has followed suit. Just wondering if anyone else is getting this. Looking at graphs it happened on 24th March. Is it due to the current global situation? 

My game is still featured in multiple areas of the Google Play home screen and search rankings haven't changed whatsoever. Very odd indeed. Am I alone?
