We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I'm a junior fullstack developer just landed my first job, I am thinking to fully remote in future and for that a portfolio is must to showcase what you're capable of, After going through many talented developer's portfolios from twitter. I decided to finally make one of my own.  


So here it is, [https://farazkhan.me](https://farazkhan.me)   
Please criticize to your heart's content, I really want to improve and make this my best frontend related work I've done.  


I realize for a single page layout using react was overkill but I really love the components based developer experience react provides, I've been doing css/sass class based animations and trying out props based styled components was an interesting experience.  


Technical details: Made using Create React App ( Will move to Gatsby once I make up my mind about blogging). Styled using styled components and tailwindcss ( bad combination, lead to messy code which I'll clean before making it public but I like simplicity of tailwind too)  


Thank you community!

Hey, Iâ€™m planning on building an app, itâ€™s a medium scaled one, we have a rest backend. Iâ€™m staying away from redux for this one. Thought of looking into apollo graphQL in the frontend in fairly new to it. Just wanted to try it out.

Is it a good idea? Can I use apollo Graphql in the front end and connect to a rest api from react app, without a node implementation?

Iâ€™ve read about apollo-link-rest, will it work in my scenario? Can you suggest a good tutorial or blog to get started with.

Or What other solutions would work here?

Most projects features in books and courses aren't particularly well-engineered, so I wanted to see if you could recommend one that tells you what are all of the best practices and best solutions for creating an application that's highly scalable and maintainable.

Hi /r/reactjs,

I'm looking for good resources on SSR with React in conjunction with expressjs.

I'm trying to integrate React into an existing expressjs app while getting all the goodies (HMR, etc) and need help with the setup.

Migrating to a framework like NextJS or Gatsby is not an option.

Thanks in advance,

## [11][How to subscribe children to a fraction of a parent's context in a native way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hdpl4e/how_to_subscribe_children_to_a_fraction_of_a/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hdpl4e/how_to_subscribe_children_to_a_fraction_of_a/

Let's suppose we have the following component hierarchy:

            A
           / \
          AB  C --- AF
         /     \
        D       AE


And suppose component A has a Context.Provider with some values and some dispatch functions.
Components AB and AE are using A context.

The requirement is that AE and AF components are subscribed to a part of the context, and AB is subscribed to another.
How do I make a structure so that context updates from AF and AE don't trigger rerenders on AB?

I thought about splitting the A context state into multiple subcontexts, but looks a bit cubersome. Which would be the standard approach? A frameworkless solution would be preferable.

Edited to add #Needs Help tag :S

Question is in the title but also when do you use this.props vs props. ?
