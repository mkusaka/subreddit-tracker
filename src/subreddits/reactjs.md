Lots of online classes and pdf notes and video tutorials.  A place to organize all of them. Thinking of creating a website, in the home page it will have cards of the subjects for e.g data structure,  computer architecture. When clicked on it., it will show two more cards pdf and video tutorials, when clicked on one it will take you to the respective page with the material. Now I want to make it all dynamic, instead of hard coding it. Through the admin panel I can create the subject cards. Any mental model or suggestions on how you would do it ?

## [7][How to update an atom state with Recoil?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j6qvty/how_to_update_an_atom_state_with_recoil/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j6qvty/how_to_update_an_atom_state_with_recoil/

I have a basic atom:

    export const userAtom = atom({
      key: "user",
      default: { name: "joe", age: 78 } 
    });

I can correctly display user.name, but not update it with SetUser. What is wrong with this code:

    function App() {
    const [user, setUser] = useRecoilState(userAtom)
    
      return (
        &lt;&gt;
          &lt;h5&gt;Hello {user.name}&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={()=&gt; setUser(prev=&gt; ({...prev,  name: "Jack"})}&gt;update name&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
      )
    }

Thanks!

The thing is... It's the first time I have to decide how to style a medium size project, It feels like a big decision to me.

My two cents: I've been working with SASS + React for years, but I'm really interested on adopting styled components on this big scale/durable project.

What are your thoughts guys?
## [10][Membership only site/app with ReactJS possible?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j6pqnr/membership_only_siteapp_with_reactjs_possible/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j6pqnr/membership_only_siteapp_with_reactjs_possible/

Hey guys,

I'd like to build a membership only app (i.e. there's no content for non-members besides the login/register form) with ReactJS, because I really like the "snappy" feel of it and developing is really fun.

But of course, since it's all JS, there's no way to really protect the "valuable" content from non-members, which sucks.

Is there any tried and tested workaround/strategy for this besides serving the content via my backend (which is at least somewhat more protected)?

Or is there even a way to combine server side rendering with all the perks of ReactJS?

Thanks a bunch!
## [11][Is there a way to make an action call return a promise?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j6p9yw/is_there_a_way_to_make_an_action_call_return_a/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j6p9yw/is_there_a_way_to_make_an_action_call_return_a/
---
Lets say I have 2 actions (createPost, createPostImage) and I want to call createPostImage after  createPost is finished.Currently I have it set up in such a way that I call createPostImage inside the createPost action body once it finishes the API call, but that kind of messes up code (it looks ugly and annoys me because I know there is a better way of doing things).

One way of which I thought of doing this is making the action return a promise, and then call dispatch inside that promise, but that too looks kind of odd and i dont know if it is the correct move.

How is this usually handled in Redux?
