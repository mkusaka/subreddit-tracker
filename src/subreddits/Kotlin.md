This came up in a couple of archived posts here, so I'm excited to say that `ktfmt` now has an IntelliJ plugin (as well as a Spotless plugin).

Also, a lot has changed in `ktfmt` since it was announced ~8 months ago - give it a try! we're listening for feedback over at https://github.com/facebookincubator/ktfmt/issues :)

Hello I am learning to program with kotlin, my idea is to create video games for android. I wanted to ask you if you know of any game engine for programming that supports kotlin.

Note: Sorry for my English I speak Spanish.

So I'm trying to build a map from 3 different lists and I am using this code here:

    map = categories!!.groupBy { it.id }.mapValues {
        map-&gt; list1!!.filter {
            a -&gt;list2!!.any { b -&gt; a.id == b.id } &amp;&amp; a.category_id == map.key
    }}.toMutableMap()

So it goes like this:

* list1 contains object1 which has the category id and an id
* list2 contains object2 which has only the id and not the category id
* The keys needs to be the category ids
* The values are the elements of list1 that have the same ids of the elements of list2
* Multiple elements can be in one category
* The end result is like this: Map&lt;Long, List&lt;object1&gt;&gt;

There is quite a lot of data to go through and right now it takes somewhere between 30sec to 1min on my phone to execute (in a coroutine).

Pretty much every language has it, would be nice to have one for Kotlin too.

P.S.

I know Maven [and Gradle](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/i5oab3/how_do_you_people_use_such_a_piece_of_shit_as/), both are total garbage.
