* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

If your Android app sells subscription products, then you will need to make sure these subscription features (account hold, restore, pause, and resubscribe) are supported. If your Android app does not sell subscription products, you will not need to worry about this upcoming change.

If you have paid apps or in app purchase then you donâ€™t to make any changes.

## [9][View not being inflated after exiting fragment and pressing the back button fast](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jbnczg/view_not_being_inflated_after_exiting_fragment/)

I have an app with a couple of fragments you can transition between. Now a big problem I have is that if I enter another fragment(using nav_graph), and immediately press the back button it will go into a blank screen. I checked it in more than one fragment.

After further testing I found out that what happens is that when I use the naviagtion to navigate to another fragment, on pause gets called, and then onDestroyView, with about a second delay, and pressing the back button in that time will make it so the onDestoyView does not get called, meaning that onCreateView does not get called so the fragment does not inflate the xml view layout.(e.g tried setting the xml to just be a black screen with a button, still get a blank whitish screen). Any Idea how I can fix this? Maybe inflate the view in the onResume if it has not been inflated, or destroy the view in onPause or something?
## [10][I saw an app that shows the devtools on phones. However this app connects to an appspot website to do this. Is it possible to do the same thing by creating a local server for devtools so it can be used offline?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jbn24x/i_saw_an_app_that_shows_the_devtools_on_phones/)
