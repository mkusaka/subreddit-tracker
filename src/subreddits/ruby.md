I've  spent a good part of this year working on revisions to the RDoc for  Array.  The revisions include all methods documentation in addition to  much of the introductory text (class documentation).  Lots more example  code.

Check it out:

\- 2.7.2: [https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Array.html](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Array.html)

\- 2.7.1: [https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Array.html](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Array.html)
