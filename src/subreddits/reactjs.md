We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I‚Äôm in the process of moving away from the  BlueprintJS table component. The product in question is a financial modelling tool and the table has many spreadsheet like features (focused cell, formulas, formatting etc). Max grid size is ~500 rows/~100 columns.

Folks needing similar functionality, how have you handled it? Use something fully batteries included like Handsontable? Implement from scratch? Or something else?

Basically the title. I have never used D3. Have always used Chart.js for charts and shit. Why would one choose D3 over Chart.js? What features does D3 have that Chart doesn't? I have noticed D3 has a lot more code to it, and probably needs a thorough course on its own. While it took me a few hours to figure out Chart.js. Am I missing something?

## [10][Using animations in React](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ii5zyb/using_animations_in_react/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ii5zyb/using_animations_in_react/

Hi all,

I am using Bulma to create a modal for my app. And I need to add some sort of animation when modal opens/closes. I managed to do it for opening by simply adding animation and keyframe to CSS and apply that class to the modal, but I can't make it work for the closing. 

The flow would look something like this:  `Click on button -&gt; Modal opens (with animation) -&gt; Click on close button inside the modal -&gt; modal closes (with animation).`

&amp;#x200B;

What I have tried to do:

* created two classes in CSS - one for `fadeIn`, one for `fadeOut`
* created state object called `animate`, which is by default set to ' '
* on click, modal is activated by adding '`is-active`' class and `fadeIn` class
* click on the close button inside the modal triggers a small function that changes the state of `animate` to `fadeOut` and removes `'is-active'` class from modal, so modal closes.   


Everything works fine, except that there is no animation when the modal closes. What am I missing? Does anyone know a better way to do this?

Most of the examples I saw include jQuery, but I would like to avoid it if possible. Also, examples are usually focused just on fadeIn or just fadeOut, never both.

Edit: formatting
