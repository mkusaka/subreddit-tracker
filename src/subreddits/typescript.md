The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring company—no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job. 

Posting top level comments that aren't job postings, [that's a paddlin](https://i.imgur.com/FxMKfnY.jpg)

So I'm making a mini Express/React Project using the [NYC Benefit Screening API] (https://screeningapidocs.cityofnewyork.us/overview) with TypeScript and Jest. I wrote types/interfaces for the accepted requests to the API and I wanted to publish them online for others to use. I've made a separate repo and written out my types both with a global namespace and as exports. So far I've figured that I need to make a PR to DefinitelyTyped with my index.d.ts file after I write some tests. I just want to confirm that this is best practice? Also any tips on writing tests for my types/interfaces?
