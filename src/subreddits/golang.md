Hi everyone! I'm Jon Calhoun, one of the panelists on the Go Time podcast. For those of you unfamiliar - it is a Go podcast that we record live every Tuesday at 3pm ET. We usually have a guest or two on each episode, and discuss a specific topic (defer, testing, databases, infra, etc). You can check it out here: &lt;https://changelog.com/gotime&gt;

This coming episode we want to try something a little different - we want to make a Q&amp;A episode. There are two reasons for doing this:

1. We are hoping this inspires topics for future episodes.
2. We want a venue to discuss questions that don't really fit into an entire episode on their own.

To make this happen we would like everyone here to post any Go-related questions that you would like us to discuss on air, and we will try to get to as many as possible. I'll also try to type up answers here while we discuss them on the episode.

We will be answering questions live tomorrow, Tuesday, Sep 8. We will repeat questions on air, and since we record live you can join in on the Gophers Slack to ask follow-up questions or to elaborate on questions.

My code isn't as great as I would like it to be, but I wrote this to tryout \`[github.com/faiface/pixel\`](https://github.com/faiface/pixel`) which was a little bit of fun.

One of the GraphQL‚Äôs goals is Abstracting many different services into a single place and allowing the developers very fine-grained control over the data they require is. [This post](https://medium.com/@roelofjanelsinga/graphql-centralize-existing-rest-api-endpoints-for-easier-development-abd7b007d7c4?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ab9ebb693fb471a0e669777524c52c17) look over a GraphQL implementation by considering this goal.

We depend on [go.etcd.io/etcd](https://go.etcd.io/etcd) which depends on google.golang.org/grpc v1.26.0 but we also depend on protoc-gen-go which requires google.golang.org/grpc v1.31.1 but breaks [go.etcd.io/etcd](https://go.etcd.io/etcd).

Is there a solution to this?

Currently gzip compression is broken, see [https://github.com/gorilla/handlers/issues/194](https://github.com/gorilla/handlers/issues/194). Keep 1.4.2 or use commit hash [d453eff](https://github.com/gorilla/handlers/commit/d453effd20e6817a8acfd9d278dadd21371da0ba).
