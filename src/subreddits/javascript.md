Hi folks, I have been practicing React.js for a while and tried to figure out to implement a Global Error Handling that would catch all errors that might occur in the entire app. 

For those who are not familiar, for catching errors that occurred in a React Component, you can use `componentDidCatch` lifecycle hook but the problem is that it cannot catch the errors that are occurred in an async operation. There might be a case that there is an async operation which you forgot to handle or don't want to handle manually but you still don't want to show the ugly error screen to the user, To solve this problem, I came up with listening to `window.onunhandledrejection` in the `ErrorBoundary` component. My concern is, that if it is, someway, a bad practice to listen to this particular event. Is there any disadvantage of listening to it?

Any thoughts?
