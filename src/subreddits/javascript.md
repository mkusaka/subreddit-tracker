Hi [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/)! We, the WebStorm team, are excited to announce our first AMA. We’ve never done anything like this before, but we feel the time has come to try something new.

If you’ve never heard of WebStorm, it is a JavaScript IDE by JetBrains. It comes with out-of-the-box support for lots of popular technologies and lets you do most of your development tasks right inside it. More information is available on [our website](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

We’ll start answering your questions at 12 pm UTC on the 24th of August and will be doing this until 5 pm UTC. You can ask us about anything related to WebStorm or the JavaScript support in any other JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, or PyCharm Professional.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers.

Your questions will be answered by:

* Andrey Starovoyt (WebStorm Team Lead), [u/anstarovoyt](https://www.reddit.com/user/anstarovoyt/),
* Ekaterina Prigara (WebStorm Product Manager), [u/prigara](https://www.reddit.com/user/prigara/),

A few weeks or month ago, I have read a very interesting blog post or tutorial about a javascript animation library for CSS (not animating in a canvas).  The library was of the functional programming kind.  If I remember well, some examples were about moving blue dots, first one, than many (in parallel, with delays, …).  l lost the link.  Could someone post the link to the blog or tutorial, or to the animation library itself?

More general question, what are good animation libraries?  anime.js? popmotion?
