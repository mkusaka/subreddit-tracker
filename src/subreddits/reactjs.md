We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I am using [react-data-table-component](https://github.com/jbetancur/react-data-table-component) to generate a fairly simple data table with sorting and filtering. The library has built in functionality for making rows selectable with a checkbox. This is all fine.

However, the event that is triggered when you click a rows gives you a data object containing *all* the rows that have been selected so far. I want access only to the row that was just clicked.


    &lt;DataTable
       data={data}
       selectableRows
       onSelectedRowsChange={doWork}
    /&gt;


...and the doWork function:


    const doWork = state =&gt; {
       // state.selectedRows contains ALL selected rows
       // There is no way to get just the clicked row that triggered the event
    }


In vanilla JS I would add an event listener and an ID to the checkbox. When checked, I'd get the ID (probably stored as a `data-id=123` attribute) and do my work with it - easy. But since you're not meant to do this with React, what's the alternative? Am I supposed to fork the library and add my own event handler? Make a feature request and wait 6 months? 

Am I completely boxed in by the funtionality provided by the library?

-----


**EDIT:** People are suggesting the workaround of storing the previous set of selected rows and then finding the difference to check what row was recently selected/de-selected. I am aware of this workaround but I will copy this reply that I sent to another user who suggested the same:

&gt; This seems to be a recurring issue as I work more with React, especially when you use third party libraries. Maybe I shouldn't have been adding click events like this when I worked with vanilla JS, but I could do it when I had to and, provided you wrote maintainable code, it worked. Everything seems very walled off with React; do it the right way (i.e. fork the library) or don't do it at all. Still hoping others can chime in and tell me I'm wrong as I'm still pretty new to this.
