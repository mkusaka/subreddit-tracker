**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* üö® **Updated Remote section.** üö® You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

So I am about two weeks away from going into a 4-week summer Data structures class in C++ and I was wondering what are the most important things I should know to be prepared? I just finished the previous class, which was a basic programming class to get into the data structures class but I didn't do too well in it.

Sort of barely got by and barely passed with a C. I want to get a much better grip on these things before I get into the way more serious classes! Any advice on what I should know to be prepared will be really helpful!
## [7][std::array vs. std::vector with std::unique_ptr](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gs2fuk/stdarray_vs_stdvector_with_stdunique_ptr/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gs2fuk/stdarray_vs_stdvector_with_stdunique_ptr/

Hi guys, I have a question regarding the difference between `std::array` and `std::vector` in the context of `std::unique_ptr`s. I'm beginning to learn cpp, so my understanding of the internals is rudimentary. I have a class, in which I want to have a `static const` array of `std::unique_ptr` pointing to an abstract class. The reason why I want it to be `static const` is because this array will never change during runtime, so any instance should point to the same object in memory. I don't know if this is good practice, I just thought it might save memory.

I tried both `std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Abstract_class&gt;&gt;` and `std::array&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Abstract_class&gt;&gt;`. I can only compile, if I use `std::array`.

    class Entity {
    private:
    //This won't work
    //static const std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Abstract_class&gt;&gt; arr;
    static const std::array&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Abstract_class, 1&gt; arr;
    //more stuff
    ...
    };
    
    //Compile error when trying to do this
    //const std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Abstract_class&gt;&gt; Entity::arr {std::make_unique&lt;Implementation_of_Abstract_class&gt;};
    //But this works
    const std::array&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Abstract_class&gt;, 1&gt; Entity::arr {std::make_unique&lt;Implementation_of_Abstract_class}; 

I'm not sure why. I though, no copying is done when using an initializer list for `std::vector`? Does this have something to do with stack and heap allocation of `std::array`/`std::vector`, respectively? Appreciate any input! :)

Or your favorite ones? And when they are useful for you?

I can see these frequently in open source projects: `-Wall, -O3, -funroll-loops, -D..`
