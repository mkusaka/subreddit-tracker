Hey guys, I'm new to reactjs. I thought the best way to learn it to try to make my own project, so chose Reddit's API and tried to build a web app with Instagram's UI.

Please have a look at it...

DEMO:  https://redditfornormies.herokuapp.com/ 

source code:  https://github.com/jaesharma/redditfornormies 

I'm still trying to improve this ... , implemented all major features I could think of... please check out and give your reviews and suggestions on how can I make It even better. Thanks.

I started learning React few weeks ago and now that my project is getting a little bit bigger, having a way to manage the state became crucial. The only issue is that I tried to learn Redux and it's so complicated... I heard about the contextAPI provided by React and I wanted to know your thoughts about it and if it's as reliable as Redux?

Hello, tried asking this on stackoverflow, but didn't get any responses. I am using this piece of code to determine what to do when the state of the youtube player changes, and always want to return if the user is not host:

    const [host, setHost] = useState()
    const [yourID, setYourID] = useState();
    
    useEffect(() =&gt; {
            socketRef.current = io.connect('/');
    
            socketRef.current.on("host", id =&gt; {
                setHost(id);
            })
    
            socketRef.current.on("your id", id =&gt; {
                setYourID(id);
            })
    
        }, []);
    
    function onPlayerStateChange(e) {
            console.log(host)
            console.log(yourID)
            if (host !== yourID) return
    
            switch (e.data) {
                // the logic to determine what to do...
            }
        }

Hovewer, both `host` and `yourID` are always returning `undefined`. On the other hand, when using a function like this on some button click, it returns the correct values:

    function test() {
        console.log(host)         
        console.log(yourID) 
    }
    &lt;button onClick={test}&gt;test&lt;/button&gt;

 My questions are as follows:

1. Why won't the values ever update in `onPlayerStateChange`, but update in other functions?
2. How should I rewrite the code? Using `useRef` worked for me, but I also use `yourID` and `host`  
 to conditionally render some elements on the page, so that wouldn't work.
