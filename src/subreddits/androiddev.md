## [4][Handling strings (placeholders) - Phrase (square lib) still recommended?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ick0js/handling_strings_placeholders_phrase_square_lib/)

Hi everyone,

we stumbled across a problem with string placeholders and translations.we wanted to have a string like "15min 30sec"so we'd define `&lt;string name="duration"&gt;%1$smin %2$ssec&lt;/string&gt;`

our translation tool is not capable of properly identifying placeholders if the do not have a trailing whitespace and are followed by an alphabetical character. so i found [https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization#mark-message-parts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization#mark-message-parts)  
maybe it's interesting to some of you which are dealing with a similar problem.  


next to that documentation i found that there's a more convenient way of handling placeholders with the lib by square: [https://github.com/square/phrase](https://github.com/square/phrase)  
you can define strings like: `&lt;string name="duration"&gt;{minutes}min {seconds}sec&lt;/string&gt;`  
and the bind the named params in code. also i placeholders are much easier to digest for external people (translators)

as it's not heavily maintained I wanted to ask if sbdy is (still) using it.

## [6][Is RealmRecyclerViewAdapter considered usable in terms of clean code/ separation of concerns?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iclw15/is_realmrecyclerviewadapter_considered_usable_in/)

Hi, 

I'm creating app in which I use Realm as my (currently) only data source. I was wondering if using RealmRVAdapter is good practice for displaying list of objects. I'm concerned about it preventing me from closing realm instance after performing query because of RealmChangeListeners used in RealmRV. 

So here few questions:

Does anyone use RealmRV in apps with MVVM and Repository pattern? If so how do you manage your Realm instance? Is keeping Realm open is considered good/passable option? Or should I ditch RealmRV and handle updates in RecyclerView on my own?

Hi Android Fellas,

`pagingDataAdapterOf` builder function for `PagingDataAdapter`,which is alpha now, has been introduced in the version 1.2.0 of kiel.

github: https://github.com/ibrahimyilmaz/kiel

Example usage: 
```kt
    private val adapter = pagingDataAdapterOf&lt;EntityListItem&gt; {
         diff(
             areItemsTheSame = { old, new -&gt; old.entityData.id == new.entityData.id },
             areContentsTheSame = { old, new -&gt; old == new }
         )
         register(
             layoutResource = R.layout.item_entity,
             viewHolder = ::EntityListItemViewHolder,
             onBindBindViewHolder = { viewHolder, _, item -&gt;
                 viewHolder.itemView.setOnClickListener { viewModel.select(item) }
                 viewHolder.binding.entityTitleTextView.text = item.title

                 viewHolder.binding.entityRemoveRelationAction.isVisible = item.isRemoveAvailable
                 if (item.isRemoveAvailable) {
                     viewHolder.binding.entityRemoveRelationAction.setOnClickListener {
                         viewModel.removeRelation(item)
                     }
                 }
             }
         )
     }
```

Any feedback, idea or PR is always welcome

Sincerely
Ibra

I am starting to explore firebase, but it seems very robust, complex system with many modules and I dont even know where to start.

Could you please point me in the right direction? **What firebase modules do I need for these use cases:**

* once in few weeks I need to send an important message to user's devices (for example about a launched discount, or about some critical update) *I want to have a full control over message style (sometimes I want to show just a Toast, for more importane messages simple dialog and in very urgent cases status bar notification)* - **should I use firebase in-app messaging, or...?**

*  my app has highly customizable look, so i would like to periodically sync user settings, so app always look same on all devices - **should I use firebase remote config?**

* I would like to make some simple polls with A/B/C options once in a while (ask users what features should I add, or other feedback) - **no idea about this...what module to use?**

Then of course I wanna use analytics and crashlytics, but thats easy to figure out.
