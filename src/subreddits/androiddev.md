Hello, I would like to share my open source library which I wrote yesterday during my free time!  
Stars would be appreciated, but only if you like it üòä

Everything is highly customisable - amount of segments, individual gradients, separators, individual segments can be animated with custom alpha animation. Title can be set, value text can be set, custom text colors, fonts, vertical offsets etc. Sure there are custom settings for startAngle, sweepAngle.  
Hopefully it will be useful to you!

Hello,

I have been self learning Android development with Java for something now using diff YouTube channels and Android official documentation.

But its frustrating as I don't have anyone to guide me.

Pls, whats the best way to learn it, I know there some many professional here, who are self-taught or learnt from School?

I want to decrease my apk size by using app bundles and serve database files based on the device language at install-time.

I've read the documentation [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/asset-delivery/build-native-java), but it doesn't mention how to serve assets based on language. 

Does anyone have an idea how to do it? Do I just create language folders (en, de, etc.) in the directory of the asset pack?

Hello everyone, 
in a few days I am going to redesign a big chunk of an app that I started to develop 3/4 years ago when I started programming. The redesign is going to change a lot both design and business logic of the product.

Most of the code is organized in activities and fragments with a lot of business logic mixed in them. However I'm also using singletons injected via dagger and I converted all my codebase in kotlin in the last two years.
My question is:
What technologies should I study and use in order to refresh all my project in the following months?
As I said, I'm proficient with Kotlin and familiar with Dagger and I also quite confident with reactive streams (I'm using them in Angular projects).

What about, for example:
Coroutines
RxJava
Jetpack components
New design patterns
New approaches to navigation 
New approaches to UI
DI

I'm missing/should focus in something else?

Hi,

r/androidev


Even after the Project Treble, GSI compliance and all these years what is holding Android platform from supporting devices that are 2 years old. After purchasing 900$ phone, 100$ in apps, the customers are left in the mercy of device manufacturer for proper software updates. 

Few custom ROM developers can make pretty stable Android build why isn't the Android team or the device manufacturers can make it happen. The latest Windows OS can support hardware more than 10 years old whereas for Android it is just for 2 years, which is pretty disheartening.  

Thanks

The beginner tutorials are really helpful, but you are pretty screwed if you try to do something even remotely different from what is presented on some of the tutorials, and then you are left having to search anywhere from 15 minutes to days.

For example: The ShapeDrawable tutorial is fantastic if you want to draw on screen and have your shape take up the whole screen. Then you can try to add the ShapeDrawable to a LinearLayout or a Textbox or an ImageView and none of them will draw your Drawable. 

But then you see, that there is a tutorial on how to add Drawables to an ImageView! You paste the code into AndroidStudio and OH NO :( It throws an exception after building fine. Now you have to figure out how to fix that and you end up on a StackOverflow page. Oh, the many pages you must sift through to find the answers eats at your time.

It ran! But the tutorial didn't draw the ShapeDrawable in the ImageView like it said it would and not you are stuck searching again.

Over and over and over and over. 

I miss the warm fuzzy documentation of Oracle.

I have this layout `activity_main.xml`:

```xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

        &lt;Button
        android:id="@+id/button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Button"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="parent" /&gt;


&lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;
```

This is my `MainActivity.java`

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private Button btn;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        // DOES SOME STUFF
    }
}
```

I have another class `MyClass.java`:

```java
public class MyClass {
     public MyClass() {
         // ACCESS BUTTON WITH ID = button
         button.setEnable(false);
     }
}
```

How can i disable the button with id = "button" in MyClass ?
