I understand I have to wrap adjacent jsx elements in fragment tags in turn statements. But why do we have to jump through this hoop? If React made this workaround so we can return adjacent elements, why not just allow that in the first place?

Hi, 

Having applied for a few react jobs, I've noticed writing tests is essential if you want to be a react dev. I am trying to learn but I find it to be a steep learning curve and I'm having trouble knowing where to start.

I've built a small react app for a take home project and I need to test it. I just have some questions I could really use some help answering.

THE APP  
 \-fetch component which fetches json from endpoints depending on which option is selected on dropdown and pushes data to state array.

 \-Print component which creates a list with input tags from data with the (input + integer from json) being added to local state.

\- Receipt component which takes input from Print component as props and prints the sum

QUESTIONS

1) What part of the app should I be testing? How in general should I know what to test?

2) A lot of the articles I've read on testing show basic examples for e.g pure functions etc.. What is the best approach to take if my component depends on fetch requests or take props?

3) Between unit testing, snapshot testing, and end to end testing, which is the best for React apps?

Thanks

I have a bunch of links at the bottom of my page and when I click one link it takes me to another render, but the app still stays in the same Y position.. How can I make my react app render at the top of the page when I click the link - just like non-SPA websites work?

## [12][I wrote this custom hook that's basically `useState`, but will log the state whenever it's used, but it doesn't work (With demo), why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fibnik/i_wrote_this_custom_hook_thats_basically_usestate/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fibnik/i_wrote_this_custom_hook_thats_basically_usestate/
---
The goal: I want a `redux-logger` for my `useState`, so that whenever state changes using the `setState` function (or setXXX, whatever you named it), it will log the previous state and the next state.

The reality: I wrote this demo https://codesandbox.io/s/gracious-mestorf-wcxvy, it doesn't work when several setState called at the same time, does that mean setState is async? And how do I make it work to achieve my goal?

PS: And something weird in my demo actually
```js
// initialState: 2 
setState(3)
setState(4)
setState(5)
// console.log: 2,2,5,5 weird, isn't it?
```
