We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

OHIF is open source DICOM(medical imaging) viewer www.ohif.org

Github https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers

In our healthcare radiologists uses expensive viewers and pay average 1$ for each DICOM(X-RAY, MRI, CT Scan etc) 

This is just a simple part of the healthcare system and you might think 1$ is not too much. 
But let me tell you this, it costs a hospital in California 20M a year... 

This big companies(Philips, Samsung and others) does not even try to sell their softwares to outside develop countries, because there isnâ€™t enough profit..

OHIF is web based and any radiologist can use it remotely diagnose patients, its not there yet, it have many missing features which radiologists needs.

Please help OHIF its a modern ReactJS project , come and do some refactoring do some bug fix.

Hi guys, I am looking for feedback on the open-source react component which our team built. This component contains 9 typescript-aware lightweight spinners. It would be great if you can check it out and let me know what you think. Thank you in advance!

Trying to make a webpage to show a interactive floor plan with an SVG image as background image, with interactive SVG icons or text boxes overlaying the background image.  As such icons needs to get a fixed position in relation to the background image, and needs to keep this position regardless of resizing of browser window, zooming etc.  The purpose is to show the status in a "smart house" environment.  Preferably the floor plan should be mouse-wheel zoomable on desktop or pan/pinch zoomable on mobile device.

Is there a library that can help with the "heavy lifting" here, in regards to graphics processing?  I've already spent quite a while on [react-zoom-pan-pinch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-zoom-pan-pinch), but was unable to get it working without having icons move around on the background image, SVG's becoming rasterized etc.

Would e.g. [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) be a possibility?  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Hello! Today was the day I finished my first React project - PokeHUB. It is an app that gets and conveniently displays data downloaded from PokeAPI (BIG thank you to the creators!). I encountered many issues and obstacles along the way and now I think I may call this app finished. Of course I am open to suggestions, reviews and criticism :)

Tech Stack:
- React 16.12
- Redux
- CSS Modules
- React-Transition-Group
- Styled Components

Deployed site: https://pokehubreact.firebaseapp.com/
GitHub: https://github.com/ciemekk92/pokehub_react

API: https://pokeapi.co

If you find anything that you think is wrong or could be done better, please let me know! Thank you :)

I have to create a navigation bar and it must have different behaviors based on the user screen size. I was thinking about making two different nav bar components, but I searched about this practice and I found nothing.

Is this a bad practice or is it just uncommon? Many thanks!

Hello Community,

I am curious how you guys force refresh the user's App state after rolling out a new version.

I have a SaaS app with a React/Redux frontend and a Java/Spring Boot backend. I'm using create-react-app and react-app-rewired with Workbox (so I wouldn't need to eject CRA). I'm relatively new to React, but I'm aware that using the service worker gives a considerable performance boost, but it also prevents refreshing the state (unless the user clears the cache / service worker entry).

My question is: whenever I roll out a new version (on AWS, in my case), how could I somehow notify the user's browser about that (perhaps log him out and clear the local storage) so that the web app is refreshed with the new stuff? How would you approach this? Perhaps using push notifications?

Thanks,  
Robert
