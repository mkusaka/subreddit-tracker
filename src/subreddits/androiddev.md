This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

You can find the links over here:  [https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) (or inside Android Studios SDK Manager)

&amp;#x200B;

This release should replace Android SDK Tools  26.1.1. Biggest change is support for running `sdkmanager` and `avdmanager` on JVM 9+, which was not possible before due to deprecated JAXB EE dependencies in the previous tools.

This can be very handy for CI builds or systems that do not have JDK8 installed.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't find a changelog yet. But for more details you can read about it over here:  [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/67495440#comment24](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/67495440#comment24)

In the activity class code it looks to be possible to directly access the views from the layout so I can do

`nameText.setText("John")`

Where nameText is the TextView id in the layout, without any findViewById... code and without enabling dataBinding or anything. So it seems its being generated automatically somewhere. 

This is confusing because I am going though some tutorials and codelabs where you need to enable Databinging and wrap the layout in a &lt;layout&gt; tag and use DataBingingUtil to load the layout etc to achieve the same thing that works out of the box?

I have a fairly popular app and would love to expand to a new market. 

I'm wondering how to go about it though. Do you have to partner with a local publisher? Or set up a chinese entity? What's the process like?

Would love any links or resources. I'm also really curious to hear other's experiences when publishing to China. 

* How has has your experience been? 
* How's the outcome, are you seeing good adoption? 
* What service did you use?
*  How many chinese app stores do you publish to? 
* How do you manage publishing to so many stores? 
* How do you manage using play services outside China? 
* Is there a replacement for chinese stores?

Where are you now and where would you like to be in the next few years?

What are the main issues you have found to achieve those goals?
