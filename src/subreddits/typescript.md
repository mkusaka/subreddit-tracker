The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring company—no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job. 

Posting top level comments that aren't job postings, [that's a paddlin](https://i.imgur.com/FxMKfnY.jpg)

Hello hovering over a variable holding `Cntr` shows me a summary of the types. Does anyone know a way to show me the complete doc. Thanks

note: you can suggest me any other tool too

Is there a convention for providing additional methods to existing classes (like you can with `obj.member = newCallable` in vanilla JS... but of course, this isn't typed)?

I have seen how you can add additional method descriptions like `interface String {fn(): whatever}` but not for new actual method implementations.

If i'm wrong on multiple levels and really seem to be barking up the wrong tree then **please** don't be afraid to tell me why.

EDIT: replaced md syntax with reddit formatting :)

One question I see come up multiple times in the Deno gitter revolves around dependency management. When I first read about using a deps.ts file in my Deno projects, I was still confused as to why I had to use one. I needed more of an explanation other than the statements on Deno's website.

Drash has an addendum to Deno's deps.ts file solution and it gives me the "why" that I needed when I first started. Hopefully it helps someone here understand the deps.ts file better as well.

## [9][[Angular] How do I properly use requestAnimationFrame in an angular component ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fac1ba/angular_how_do_i_properly_use/)

This is my attempt :  


      ngAfterViewInit(){
        // get the context
        const canvasEl: HTMLCanvasElement = this.canvas.nativeElement;
        this.ctx = canvasEl.getContext('2d');
    
        // set the width and height
        canvasEl.width = this.width;
        canvasEl.height = this.height;
    
    
    
        this.animate();
     }
     
     
      animate() {  
        window.requestAnimationFrame(this.animate);
      }

But I am getting this error in console :

So how do I create an animation loop in an angular component ?  
I know that setTimeout/setInterval works, however I've heard they're inefficient.
