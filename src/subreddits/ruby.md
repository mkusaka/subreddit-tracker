I post a lot of Rails content on YouTube, mostly around building clones or MVP's of well known web apps. This time I decided to do something different and revisit the Ruby language itself. My personal experience when getting into Rails was to skip most of the Ruby basics. It took a while before I went back to figure out the basics.

If you are like me then this video might be helpful (or if you are just starting your Ruby/Rails journey). I figured I would share here anyway in case it's useful to someone.

I'm planning to post some more Ruby content so would be open to suggestions about content ideas :)
