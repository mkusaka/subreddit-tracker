I'm trying to improve my coding skills. Messiness is one of my main problems (in real life and while coding). These are some articles that helped me shift to writing clean code. I'm looking for more great resources, tips, articles, or books that would help even more. Does anyone know more resources I could add to my list? If so, please mention it in the comments, and I will add it to to the list.

If a multi page project has a single JS file, whatâ€™s the best way to handle your code?

Letâ€™s assume vanilla js. 
For a dead easy example...

Letâ€™s say I have a project with two pages. Each page needs some JavaScript to do something. For this example letâ€™s say we need to hide and show a div on one page by clicking a button and on the second page we want to expand/collapse some divs. 

If the project is sharing a single js file, whatâ€™s the best way to handle the code? Do you test to see if the element you want to apply the code to exists and then write the code if it does? Is there another/better way?

Hi, I'm about to start a project for a service that I'd like to optimise for heavy traffic and database queries, while still running in NodeJS (TypeScript + Fastify) as it is high performance and easier to find contributors.

I usually work on serverless environments so DynamoDB and Athena are my choices when it comes to persistent data. However, for this project I will need Postgresql as the project should not depend on AWS.

I am looking at sql builders or other libraries helping with sql. My preference would be to write statements myself but I don't want to write raw sqls because of sql injections.

I've looked into TypeORM, Klex and Sequelize.  I have to say I'm not impressed by any of them. The first is too magic, the second and the third are somewhat lacking in TypeScript support.

What do you use for sql in your backend projects?

Cheers!

I don't think it's [underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org/), although that seems like the obvious answer.

This framework has a kind of meta-object/function broadly equivalent to the $() thing in jQuery and it's `_()`.

Is that a feature of any library you know, or maybe a compiler/transpiler from another language?
