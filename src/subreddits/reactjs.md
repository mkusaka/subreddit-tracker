Hi all, I've just launched a new datepicker component by ReactJS. This datepicker is inspired by the datepicker in Google flight. It works well in both desktop and mobile.

You can check the live demo and props for this component at here: [https://github.com/JSLancerTeam/react-google-flight-datepicker](https://github.com/JSLancerTeam/react-google-flight-datepicker)

What is the difference? They seem awfully similar but I don't know which one is better/faster? I'm creating a static site with Gatsby &amp; Typescript if that's relevant.

Hello guys, new to React and Geo maps here, so please be nice :D

I am building a project where I want the user to be able to interact with a map.

Some of the scenarios that I want to have for example are:

\- Draw a polygon object and save it into the PostGIS database

\- Insert a marker and save it into PostGIS

\- Read all the selections from the database and display them on the map, etc. etc.

I looked trough the available libraries for that purpose, but there are so many and I am kind of stuck on this one.

Initially I started with Google Maps, but then there were two libraries, and in the time when I was reading which one was the official one I saw that I can use Mapbox, so I then started with react-map-gl and I am currently using this one. I have also had a look at Leaflet, but not sure about it.. So can you please tell me which library have you used in your own project?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!!
## [11][Video-JS with React Hooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fgd3ey/videojs_with_react_hooks/)

Hey there, I'm trying to implement a video-js player with React using hooks. I'm able to initialise the player and everything is fine, I want to be able to update a state based on the current time of the video. The second `useEffect` runs once and doesn't want to continue re-rendering to update the state (`currentTime` stays at "0"), I'm sure the problem is simple and syntax based thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

    export default function VideoPlayer ({ videoSrc }) {
      const videoPlayerRef = useRef() // Instead of ID
      const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(null)
      const videoJSOptions = {
        autoplay: 'muted',
        fluid: true,
        controls: true,
        userActions: { hotkeys: true },
        playbackRates: [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
      }
      // Initialise video player
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const player = videojs(videoPlayerRef.current, videoJSOptions, () =&gt; {
          player.src(videoSrc)
          console.log('Player Ready')
        })
        return () =&gt; {
          player.dispose()
          console.log('Player Disposed')
        }
      }, [])
    
      /* Testing video properties */
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const player = videojs(videoPlayerRef.current)
        setCurrentTime(player.currentTime())
      }, [currentTime])
    
      return (
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;video ref={videoPlayerRef} className='video-js' /&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;Current Time: {currentTime}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      )
    }
