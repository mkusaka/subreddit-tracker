Ruby isn't as popular these days, but I'm currently learning it as I'm going through a full stack web developer course (app academy) that uses it for their backend teaching, but I'm curious for anyone that writes code day to day with Ruby and **does so out of choice**, why? Python is a common comparison, the advantage being the massive amount of libraries, or Haskell with purely functional programming goodness, Lisp has macros, Erlang or Ada for safety, C++ for performance, but where does Ruby fit in? I have no hatred for Ruby mind you, it seems pretty okay so far but nothing that stands out particularly.

My background is some bash and Common Lisp mainly, and both just for scripts and hobby projects, but I'm going the web developer route so I'm picking up Ruby as per the course. Should I stick with Ruby for the backend when I'm done? That's going to trigger biased answers of course but I'm still interested in what you have to say! Let me know what you think and thanks for reading.

Can't access [ruby-lang.org](https://ruby-lang.org) due to failed dns lookup. This happening to anyone else.

## [7][ri --server - not able to search Ruby documentation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/epag4n/ri_server_not_able_to_search_ruby_documentation/)

Hi, I've been developing using Ruby, and I've (in the past) been able to search for base objects (String, Array etc.) using the server.

However, recently, I've been unable to do so - e.g. searching for String doesn't give me any Ruby documentation links. Has anyone else had this problem? 

I currently run Arch Linux, with Ruby 2.7.0.

Edit: I should add - I _am_ able to see documentation links if using ri on the command-line.

Hello

I've just made my first gem! It's a wrapper for an instant search engine API (MeiliSearch). It means indexes, documents, and search handling.  
[https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-ruby](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-ruby)

I love ruby language, it's literally my favorite one, but I use it more with Rails than in this kind of situation.

So, I need your feedback to correct and improve it!

Thanks for your time.

And for the curious ones, here is the repository of our search engine MeiliSearch. We are open-source and we really need your support! ‚≠êÔ∏è Each star and feedback are important for us üôÇ[https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)

Hello everyone, I hope you are well. I'm not sure if it's the best place for such announcements but I was sharing with you my articles for the past 2 years so I decided to write here as I appreciate this community and the value it gives.

I have just finished one of my projects and have more free time now. I thought that I may work with programmers that have fewer experience than me to help them improve the quality of their code or careers as Ruby developers. Does anyone need a consultation, code review or advice? It will be free, maybe in the future, I will think about some kind of compensation in case of a longer partnership but for now, I just wanted to check if there is anyone interested that I could share my knowledge and experience with and see what type of problems do you have.
