Hello Gophers, I recently released an X11 Hotkey Daemon, that is heavily inspired by sxhkd and competes with it! It has everything sxhkd has, except chord chains , which will be implemented soon! Read the README file to find out why you would prefer my hotkey daemon over sxhkd. https://github.com/dakyskye/dxhd

I am using Go Migrate to create tables, should I also use this process to seed my database with default data? For example, have a migration file that inserts some default users into a users table? Or is this bad practice?
## [7][Help Wanted : How to convert flatbuffers raw []byte data received from websocket to *flatBuffers.Builder so that it can be passed to flatbuffers grpc method?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/h9e5uc/help_wanted_how_to_convert_flatbuffers_raw_byte/)

Context:

I am creating a proxy service that proxies websocket Send and Recv data to grpc using flatbuffers.

Client (sends data to proxy using flatbuffers encoding) -&gt; proxy (\[\]byte data is received from websocket Recv method and send it as it is to another service via grpc bidirectional stream) -&gt; another service (receives the flatbuffers message in stream Recv method).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am facing problem when I want to send the flatbuffers raw \[\]byte data from websocket to grpc. The autogenerated code for grpc only accepts \*flatbuffers.Builder object as sender, constructing a builder requires unpacking the \[\]byte data to a message and reconstructing the message, this involves a copy, is there any way to do the same with zero data copy?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my flatbuffers schema:

*namespace* packet;  
*table* Message {  
 command:string;  
 data:\[ubyte\];  
}  
rpc\_service Packet {  
 Send(Message):Message (streaming: "bidi");  
}

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the command used to generate go files:

`flatc --grpc --go --gen-object-api packet/packet.fbs`

Here is the autogenerated GRPC interface (as u can see write accepts only builder):

*type* PacketClient *interface*{  
 Send(ctx context.Context,   
opts... grpc.CallOption) (Packet\_SendClient, error)    
}

*type* Packet\_SendClient *interface* {  
 Send(\*flatbuffers.Builder) error  
 Recv() (\*Message, error)  
  grpc.ClientStream  
}

Here is the code currently I am using to receive the binary data from websocket and send it to other service via grpc:

*func* (handler \*handler) *runIngress*() {  
 *for* true {  
 data, err := handler.client.Read()  
fmt.Println(err, data)  
 *if* err != nil {  
fmt.Println(err)  
 *break*  
}  
 // *I want to avoid doing this part*  
 // *-------------------------------*  
 message := packet.GetRootAsMessage(data, 0)  
 builder := flatbuffers.NewBuilder(0)  
builder.Finish(message.UnPack().Pack(builder))  
 // *-------------------------------*  
   
 // *The actual write*  
 err = handler.tunnel.Write(context.Background(), builder)  
 *if* err != nil {  
fmt.Println(err)  
}  
}  
}

How can I do in zero copy?

I'm a software developer who's been using the Microsoft ecosystem for 8 years. In particular .Net. I'm trying to figure out the next programming language I want to learn.  
  
   
I want to use it as long as possible, for as many things as possible without having to learn new features/tooling all the time. I want something stable and self contained.  
  
I have seen Microsoft hype many tools, only to abandon them quietly once developers were invested and comfortable using them. No more of this for me.  

  
Recently I was migrating a MVC website from .Net framework to .Net core and getting frustrating at all the breaking changes.  
I was spending my time Googling error messages or method names to find their equivalent in .net core.   
  
I have always been annoyed at the magic behind the scene that makes things implicit. Even simple things like how Views map to controller/actions, or the Injection Dependency built in .net core.  
I know all this stuff is useful when you master it... But I'm tired of learning the technicalities of yet another flavor of the same old wheel.  
I like to read code and just get it.  
  
The stuff I code includes:  
-video games for fun (where Xna/Monogame libraries are really useful)  
-web apps backend (I don't mind using a JS based framework for the frontend)    
-data integration  
-financial computation  
  
I want my programming experience to be about mastering a tool and using it to create value.  
I don't want my programming experience to be about learning many tools and keeping up with their evolution so that I spend little time on creating value.  

I have not used C since school, but I have always liked how plain C ANSI is a self contained tool that can be mastered once for all.  
  
Would you say Golang matches my requirements?  
  
Thanks.
