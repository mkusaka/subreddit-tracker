Hi, is there any where to find out what is pointing to a particular instance of a struct. 

I have something which is not being garbage collected, and must be still being marked as reachable by being referenced from somewhere else that is in turn still active, but I canâ€™t figure out where.

If there was a way to see what is referencing a struct (pointing to it) then that would be really helpful in figuring this out.

Hi all,

This is my first reddit post ever (woohoo!) and what better way to send it off than with questions regarding Go!

I am currently a fullstack developer with Python and JS under my belt, however I want to eventually become a Go developer. I have already taken a course on Udemy teaching me the basics, however I am finding myself at a loss when it comes to the next steps. I just bought the Go book (can't wait to read) but was hoping that someone out there knew of some other resources I could use to improve my knowledge and skill. If you have any recommendations, please let me know. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

\--edit: I see in the comments that some have suggested I work on small projects to familiarise myself more with the language. Does anyone have any recommendations for that? Especially ones that highlight the use of Go over other languages? Thanks again

I want to explore golang. I'm not sure how will I start with it(need sugesstions). I come from python(Django) world and it took me a while to figure out the python and it's ecosystem but now i'm certain that my interest is in backend engineering with golang.

I want to ask that I am flipping from python to golang in order to learn and explore it's concepts. I am thinking to settle with golang as it is the best programming language so far.

How should I approach this thought in future as an aspiring backend golang developer?   
What opportunities should I accept and aim for?

Hello, I am new to Golang and I am creating a Web Application where I need data from another API. And here the problem arises, that API from which I want to get data from got OAuth Token which is needed to pass as a request parameter, not in the header. Need Help. How can I do that?
