## [2][Question: Is there a generic name for this type function: (state, fn) =&gt; fn(state)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fuxfwc/question_is_there_a_generic_name_for_this_type/)

example;

    type Item {
        title: string,
        price: number
    }
    
    type State { 
        items: Item[]
    } 
    
    let state: State = { 
        items: []
    }
    
    function foo&lt;T, U&gt;(state: T, fn: (v: T) =&gt; U): U {}
    
    let totalPrice = foo(state, ({ items }) =&gt; items.reduce((acc, next) =&gt; acc + next.price, 0));
    
    let mostExpensive = foo(state, ({ items }) =&gt; Math.max(...items.map(item =&gt; item.price)));
    
    let firstItem = foo(state, ({ items }) =&gt; items[0]);

How do you guys call such function like \`foo\`.

It would be cool if there was a CLI of some sort that accepted a file and converted each of its exports into a bundled, portable module.

I was wishing something like this existed recently when I was migrating a single API endpoint (written in TypeScript) from an AWS instance (I'll call this Repo #1) to Google Cloud Functions (Repo #2). Even though all the code was written and working in Repo #1, it was a huge chore to move it to Repo #2 because the endpoint code used a few classes and utility functions that were scattered throughout my codebase. All said and done, I ended up copying and pasting a dozen files (mostly containing simple util functions) over to Repo #2 and having to do a lot of manual rewriting of \`import\` statements to account for the changes in project structure. It was very annoying and dumb.

So I was wishing I could have just exported the endpoint from Repo #1 to a bundled, single-file module that I could drop into Repo #2. Ideally it would do tree shaking so it only imports the code from Repo #1 that it actually needs to run. Everything was implemented in strict TypeScript so it was all types and there were no weird global variables or what have you.

Does anyone have a sense of how difficult this would be to do? I don't have a good grasp of the inner workings of the TS engine or parser.

Hi there,

I'm having an hard time to create a function receiving a type as a parameter.

The main idea is the to make the following code work. What kind of magic do I have to put on the "feed" function?

    class Cat {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    } 
    
    feed(Pick&lt;Cat, 'name') // Error: 'Pick' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.ts(2693)

Hi there! I'm fairly new to typescript, so maybe the question is wrong itself but, I need to do get the possible outputs of a function as the keys for an object. That is:

    interface Tagger {
        factory: (x: number) =&gt; T
        tags: { [key of T]: () =&gt; void }
    }
    
    const tagger: Tagger = {
        factory: x =&gt; x % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd",
        tags: {
            even: () =&gt; console.log('is even'),
            odd: () =&gt; console.log('is odd'),
        }
    }

The property `tags` should have possible keys `"even" | "odd"`.

Is this even possible? Thanks!

I have a project right now for a job I just started that is stumping me and making me sweat. I need to do checks on a dataset to ensure that there is data in a sub-array of a sub-array, and if there is no data, it should return. I have the code to check if the initial array is empty, but I can't really figure out how to check for each array as shown in the picture. For example, the device\_name has something in the sub\_bucket, but dhcp\_fingerprint does not. Do I have put in the code for every el.sub\_bucket\[#\].sub\_bucket\[0\] is empty? Or is there a better way to run this check than writing it 6 times over?

`if (!Array.isArray(result) || result.length &lt; 1 ) {`

`return [];`
