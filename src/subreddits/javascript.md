 I am collecting **projects/websites** that use ***Web Worker*** **+** ***SharedArrayBuffer*** **+** ***WASM*** as **multi-threaded web benchmarks**.

Welcome to share popular/famous/useful websites here!

(I think it is somehow hard to find MANY of these kinds of projects, especially knowing they use SharedArrayBuffer.)

Thanks for your help!
