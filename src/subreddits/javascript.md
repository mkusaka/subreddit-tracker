I've been using it for years but I still find it hard to grasp that I need to add 7.5kB gzipped to my production bundle just for detecting swipes, pans, and pinch gestures.

Distributed Object Protocol is a project I've been working for five years in my spare time. I've changed the API many times and the protocol was on draft for a long time. But after all the criticism from people and myself I just released the version that I think it could be a very good solution for state-management and real-time apps.

The docs are not finished. I just wrote the basics. I want to see if you people understand the core concepts and the purpose of this project.

Ask me any question that is not clear. And please hit me with good or bad feedback.
