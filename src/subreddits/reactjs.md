I am thinking about how to write my authentication code. I want to use cookies to store the JWT so when the user returns to the site they are still logged in.

However I am aware that there are some cases when the user may have cookies disabled and/or their local storage. Is it normal to consider engineering a solution around this or do most sites only work if cookies are enabled?

If a solution is needed how would I go about it? I guess I would just have to force the user to login again when they return to the site and store the token in context or something.

Any pointers on this would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Recently, I've had the opportunity to work on a module that had a bottomsheet kind of component. So, I thought why not ship this is a module for the open source community. What do you guys think?

I did not write a lot of test for my full stack apps before. I feel bored and troublesome to write snapshot test, unit test, etc, esp. for small size apps.

Recently a friend of mine invited me to start a new business project and I will be the only main programmer. He has a fairly complete database design and UI design and CSS is still not complete. So I started to build the GraphQL server first.

This time I embraced test-driven coding: I write tests before even starting making the resolvers. Then my tests as well as my codebase start to grow, but the feeling of afraid of writing incomplete or buggy code is completely gone! 

Previously I was not well-planned and I always started coding both frontend and backend together. It was very tiring to manage so many functions and data flow and switching mindset between. Now I focused my GraphQL API only, and think deeply how should the input be, and how to return meaningful errors. I think I have found a right way to code efficiently and effectively.

Whats your thought on this?

Yeah, I've been away for quite some time, but I would like to get back into my shape asap. I would also appreciate it if someone could update me on what news I've missed out on React.

Thank you!

I am trying to convert a legacy web app over to reactjs. This is an example piece of HTML (it's part of the top navbar containing the signup/login buttons):

    &lt;div class="top-navbar-right"&gt;
    
        &lt;div id="nightmode-container" class="flex center row-reverse"&gt;
            &lt;i class="fas fa-moon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
        &lt;div class="flex"&gt;
            &lt;div id="signup" class="star-button"&gt;Sign Up&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div id="login" class="star-button"&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;/div&gt;

* Nightmode-container is a padded, centered div aligned to the left with display flex.
* The signup and login buttons are aligned to the right.
* top-navbar-right is a flex container with space-between.
* All of the above code is part of the "navbar", it's just the right part of it

I'm using Styled Components. **This is where I'm not sure if I'm following the correct "react way":**

    &lt;NavRight&gt;
    &lt;div id="nightmode-container" class="flex center row-reverse"&gt;
       &lt;Nightmode/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="flex"&gt;
       &lt;Button&gt;Sign Up Free&lt;/Button&gt;
       &lt;Button&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/NavRight&gt;

These are my questions:

1. Should everything be React Components? I have left "nightmode-container" as an ordinary div as it doesn't have function other than some css styling which I can apply via stylesheet. My logic is too many React Components on the screen will cause slowdown or just isn't desirable in general? 
2. Similarly to 1, I am just wrapping the Buttons in a div. I'm aware of Fragment but I need to apply styling to this div. The problem I am now faced with is how to put a margin-right:15px on the Sign Up button. I'm aware I can put in-line styling on the Button with style={{margin-right:15px}} but I want a better way to do it because I want the styling to be responsive via media queries. Should I simply put a "sign-up" class on the button and target it via ordinary stylesheet? Or is there a clever way to target it via StyledComponents? I tried putting a sign-up class and this

&amp;#8203;

    export const NavRight= styled.div`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: ${sizes.columnLeftWidth}px;
    padding: ${sizes.spacing}px;

 &amp; .sign-up{
        margin-right:15px;
 }
`;

Thanks for any tips.
