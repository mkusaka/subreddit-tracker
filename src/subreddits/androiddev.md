My app widgets need to connect internet to update itself. I use alarmmanager.  But it doesn't work on some devices because battery optimization. I want to ask my user to disable it with REQUEST\_IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATIONS permission. But what if Google ban my app? How can I be sure. There are some other apps which are same category they ask disable battery optimization to users.

Rant on ad networks : I have used admob a year ago but then it got terminated in couple of months without payment. They stated own clicks which hadn't done. Then I switched to facebook ad network and after a year they terminated my account too without any reasoning? Like  they dont want to pay the devs or what. Moreover I had meager earnings may be around 6$ in a year and now they block me after a year? Like what the hell? Which ad network I am supposed to use now? The worst part is they dont specify reason clearly or dont specify at all. No one is there to help at customer service. Guys need your insights.

Hi there! I am not really sure that what I am asking is offtopic, but if it is please delete it.

In order to debug an application that I do NOT own I started using Charles proxy([https://www.charlesproxy.com](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)), due to its intuitive and easy interface. However in order to make it work with SSL I have to install on my device its certificate ( [https://chls.pro/ssl](https://chls.pro/ssl)).

What Charles states is that :

&gt;As of Android N, you need to add configuration to your app in order to have it trust the SSL certificates generated by Charles SSL Proxying. This means that you can only use SSL Proxying with apps that **you control**.

I had a look in internet and it seems that it is still possible to install the certificate in a rooted device, but I am not an expert on that.

Is there somebody who already tried that attempt with success?

## [11][Google reviewers telling us that the ad content in our app is not consistent with the app's content rating. Ignoring that we have a Neutral Age Screen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ij7nht/google_reviewers_telling_us_that_the_ad_content/)

Hi guys,

Google constantly rejecting our updates because of  the policy violation (ads are not suitable for children). But after reading through all of the Google Play policies many times we can't find any violations in our game.

&amp;#x200B;

Our game (50M installs) is rated 7+ and our audience includes both under and over 13 years old age groups.

&amp;#x200B;

This part is from Google Play Policy:

"If your app's target age groups include both children and older audiences, any ads that may be shown to children must be in compliance with Google Play's Families Ads Program. A **neutral age screen** must be implemented so that any ads not suitable for children are only shown to older audiences."

&amp;#x200B;

And this is from one of the Google Play emails that we got after appeal:

"Ensure that your app complies with all Families Policy Requirements (for example, you can include a neutral age screen if it’s applicable)."

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is that we already implemented neutral age screen so children under 13 years old can see only suitable ads that are rated 3+.

We tested our ads and our age screen - everything meets the requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps someone else has come across a similar situation and can share ideas on how to solve this problem?

so I have an App on Play store with size 14mb, yesterday I released a new version where I optimized the size to 12mb, but now I have reviews telling me that it's taking a lot of time to download when they have a speed wifi connection,   
I tried it myself it's really slow compared to Facebook app 45mb for example.   
is this store issue or something a developer can do something about?
