We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi, I'm using react's lazy and suspense for code-splitting. I use chrome's coverage tab to identify dead code and then lazy load those components. What patterns or resource should be good to look into

Hi all!

What would be some good examples of problems to stay fresh and be in a sharp coding mentality for pair programming interviews using react. Some quick ones that come to mind are counter and to do list examples. 

Thanks in advance !

I am creating a registration form. I'm using redux-thunk to run the async code and the state changes but it doesn't get reflected in my component. I'm using my own api which returns an obj in both cases, in this format {msg:"Success or Failure"} and I want to alert whether the registration has been successful or not and then redirect to "/login", if registration succeeds or to "/register" again if it fails.

registerActions.js

    import axios from "axios";
    import {
      REGISTER_INITIATED,
      REGISTER_SUCCESS,
      REGISTER_FAILED,
    } from "./registerTypes";
    
    export const register = (registerDetails) =&gt; {
      return (dispatch, getState) =&gt;
        new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {
          dispatch(registerInitiated());
          axios
            .post("/api/client/register", registerDetails)
            .then((response) =&gt; {
              dispatch(registerSuccess(response.data));
              resolve();
            })
            .catch((error) =&gt; {
              dispatch(registerFailed(error.response.data));
              resolve();
            });
    
        });
    };
    
    export const registerInitiated = () =&gt; {
      return {
        type: REGISTER_INITIATED,
      };
    };
    export const registerSuccess = (data) =&gt; {
      return {
        type: REGISTER_SUCCESS,
        data,
      };
    };
    export const registerFailed = (data) =&gt; {
      return {
        type: REGISTER_FAILED,
        data,
      };
    };

registerReducer.js

    import { REGISTER_INITIATED, REGISTER_SUCCESS, REGISTER_FAILED } from "./registerTypes";
    
    const initialState = {
      loading: false,
      data: "",
      error: ""
    }
    
    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; {
      switch (action.type) {
        case REGISTER_INITIATED:
          return {
            ...state,
            loading: true
          }
        case REGISTER_SUCCESS:
          return {
            loading: false,
            data: action.data.msg,
            error: ""
          }
        case REGISTER_FAILED:
          return {
            loading: false,
            data: "",
            error: action.data.msg
          }
        default: return state
      }
    }
    
    export default reducer

RegisterScreen.js

    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import "../componentsStyles/RegisterScreen.css";
    import { register } from "../redux";
    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

      const [designation, setDesignation] = useState("");
    
      const dispatch = useDispatch();
      const data = useSelector((state) =&gt; state.register.data);
      const error = useSelector((state) =&gt; state.register.error);
      
      // I'm not able implement this function!!!!
      // redux-thunk is able to change the state(data and error) but it is not 
  // reflecting in my component, it is alerting the initial empty values.
    
      const submitHandler = (e) =&gt; {
        e.preventDefault();
        dispatch(register({ name, email, password, company, designation })).then(
