**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

## [3][Hard-to-test patterns in C++ and how to refactor them](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g5x3ze/hardtotest_patterns_in_c_and_how_to_refactor_them/)

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/platisd/refactoring-for-testability-cpp)

I am looking for feedback on my collection of examples/"patterns" of hard-to-test code in C++ and how you could refactor them to make them easily *testable*.
Please note the *difficulty* in this case does not imply complexity. Instead the focus is on code that:

* Requires irrelevant software to be tested too
  * E.g.: 3rd party libraries, classes other than the one under test
* Delays the test execution
  * E.g.: sleeps inside code under test
* Requires intricate structures to be copied or written from scratch
  * E.g.: Fakes containing (a lot of) logic
* Requires test details to be included in the production code
  * E.g.: `#ifdef UNIT_TESTS`
* Makes changes and/or is dependent on the runtime environment
  * E.g.: Creating or reading from files

Let me know what you think! :)

## [5][Constexpr SQL: a compile time SQL library](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g5l2nt/constexpr_sql_a_compile_time_sql_library/)

GitHub link: [https://github.com/mkitzan/constexpr-sql](https://github.com/mkitzan/constexpr-sql)

For my honors project at UVic, I wrote a library which parses string literal SQL queries into relational algebra expression trees at compile time. Using Constexpr SQL and modern C++ programming idioms you can query containers of `std::tuple`-like objects as you would query tables in SQL. The repo's README has information on [features](https://github.com/mkitzan/constexpr-sql#library-features-and-compiler-support) and an [example](https://github.com/mkitzan/constexpr-sql#example) which demonstrates the core library features. The README also has implementation details with references into the code base for folks interested in learning about TMP and `constexpr` parsing techniques.

The goal of Constexpr SQL is to eliminate the need for hand-written SQL-like data processing code, and the need to use a DBMS backend in light weight data processing contexts. I'm happy to answer questions and would love some feedback about the project. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests to the repo as needed.

Hello good people of r/cpp!

I am a newbie trying my way around Bjarne Stroustrup's book "Programming Principles and Practices Using C++"

An excellent book except for one thing: the very first example of *Hello World* has this std\_lib\_facilities.h and a macOS user myself I have no idea what I should do with this. I've read it's a file that I have to save somewhere but I am still clueless. Could a kind person please help me with this? Really wanna use this book but I am stuck at this. Also: how do you compile cpp files in terminal? Any input is welcome!

I have a project where I have the main file **main.cpp** and I'm including other 9 **.cpp** files and 1 **.h** file in it.

In all my .cpp and .h files, I have **#ifndef** and **#define.**

When I try to build it, it throws the error **ld returned 1 exit status**.

Any idea what could be causing it? Thanks in advance!

## [11][Request for Comment on C++ Port of Rust's Mutex Class](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g5mo37/request_for_comment_on_c_port_of_rusts_mutex_class/)

Rust has a pretty nice std::sync::Mutex class that wraps the value the mutex protects. I thought it would be edifying to myself as well as potentially useful to implement something similar in C++. Well, [here](https://gitlab.com/Seosaidh/synchronized-value) it is. Any comments are welcome, as it's the first time I've written any sort of a serious template library. Nearly all of my experience is in application development.

C++ has tons of cool an amazing features especially with the addition of C++20. Whatâ€™s your favorite?
