This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

iOS offers [NSCache](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscache) where it will automatically evict objects based on system resources. Makes it super easy for devs. I couldn't find anything for Android development. Closest was [LRUCache](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/util/LruCache) but it doesn't automatically take system resources into account. Seems you have to manually come up with a number for its size. Maybe there is an android equivalent to NSCache or maybe there is a way to determine the best cache size by using some system APIs?

Could someone please, please, please provide an example of fully functional FloatingActionButton? All the tutorials on line seem to be copied from developer.android .com home page, only more wordy. And non of them provide any information that would make the dumb thing do anything.

Or should just find other hobbies?

## [12][How can I save my Map Markers when returning from Map Activity to my Main Activity?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iw5fv7/how_can_i_save_my_map_markers_when_returning_from/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iw5fv7/how_can_i_save_my_map_markers_when_returning_from/
---
I am trying to create markers based on data I receive from the 3 axis of the phone. Each time I get a new Pothole location I create a Marker inside the Map Activity with the coordinates I have received. But whenever I return from my Map Activity to my Main Activity. My markers don't get saved. I have read the documentation about the savedInstanceState but I cannot seem to get it to work. Being a novice on Map SDK any help would be greatly appreciated.

Map Activity:

			public class MapsActivity extends FragmentActivity					   
			implements OnMapReadyCallback, LocationListener {

    private GoogleMap mMap;
    double latitude = 0;
    double longitude = 0;
    private LocationManager locationManager;
    private static final long MIN_TIME = 400;
    private static final float MIN_DISTANCE = 1000;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        //onSaveInstanceState(true);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_maps);


        // Obtain the SupportMapFragment and get notified when the map is ready to be used.
        SupportMapFragment mapFragment = (SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager()
                .findFragmentById(R.id.map);
        mapFragment.getMapAsync(this);
        // mapFragment.getMapAsync(this);
        locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
        if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED &amp;&amp; ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            return;
        }
        locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER, MIN_TIME, MIN_DISTANCE, this);
        //Get the bundle

        Bundle extras = getIntent().getExtras();
        if (extras != null) {
            latitude = extras.getDouble("lat");
            longitude = extras.getDouble("long");
        }
        else{
            Location location = new Location("Provider");
            latitude = location.getLatitude();
            longitude = location.getLongitude();
        }
    }

    public void onMapReady(GoogleMap googleMap) {
        mMap = googleMap;
        mMap.setMyLocationEnabled(true);
        mMap.getUiSettings().setMyLocationButtonEnabled(true);

        LatLng pothole = new LatLng(latitude, longitude);
        mMap.addMarker(new 
 
 
     				
						MarkerOptions().position(pothole).title("Pothole").icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource(R.drawable.potholesmall)));
       			mMap.moveCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoom(pothole, 10));
        mMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.zoomTo(15));

    }


    @Override
    public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onStatusChanged(String provider, int status, Bundle extras) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onProviderEnabled(String provider) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onProviderDisabled(String provider) {

    }
    @Override
    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle savedInstance) {
        super.onSaveInstanceState(savedInstance);

    }

    }
