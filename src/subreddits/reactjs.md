We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

More an open question than a specific problem, but for context I'm building a React app, and using firebase for auth, and also using firebase realtime-database.

So user will log in, obviously making a request, then I make up to 4 different requests to different tables/nodes, to populate the 'Home' page with relevant user info, and it got me thinking, should I be deploying one request to my own api which then will log in user, make the 4 requests and  return all the the data back to the user?

The app isn't overly complex at the moment so am reluctant to add this extra layer right now.

So In other peoples experience when should you add your own api?

Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using React.useState to maintain state of two identical child components. The components are just a star rating component. 

When I update the first component, things work fine, but when I update the last last component, the first rating component is update. In other words, when I one the second component adjust the amount of starts, the change is executed on the first component instead of the second one. 

Please see [https://codesandbox.io/s/elated-monad-n01il](https://codesandbox.io/s/elated-monad-n01il) for demo.

What am I missing here - why does this happen?

I am currently working on a reactjs website which displays various user profiles created and managed by the admin himself. Visitors can review these profiles and rate them but there is no authentication or sign ups required in any step. I was wondering if cloud firestore is the right option for this.  Any suggestions ?

Hi,  


I am trying to make an application to understand data flow in React.   


I have an object which looks like :

```
var data = \[  
  { id: 1, text: 'A', favorite: false },  
  { id: 2, text: 'B', favorite: false },  
  { id: 3, text: 'C', favorite: false },  
  { id: 4, text: 'D', favorite: false },  
  { id: 5, text: 'E', favorite: false },  
  { id: 6, text: 'F', favorite: false },  
  { id: 7, text: 'G', favorite: true },  
  { id: 8, text: 'H', favorite: false },  
  { id: 9, text: 'I', favorite: false },  
  { id: 10, text: 'J', favorite: false },  
  { id: 11, text: 'K', favorite: false },  
  { id: 12, text: 'L', favorite: false },  
  { id: 13, text: 'M', favorite: false },  
  { id: 14, text: 'N', favorite: true },  
  { id: 15, text: 'O', favorite: true },  
\];

```

These have to be displayed as a set of 15 cards, with &lt;h1&gt;id&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt; and &lt;button onClick={toggle favorite between true and false} /&gt;.

I have to do the following in React.

1. Show all the cards with favorite as true on top
2. all the cards which are favorite are red and others are white

I have set up the repo here: https://github.com/akhil9tiet/sampleCards

it is a basic Create React App and all the code is in `App.js`

Anyone who could help me, I will really be grateful
