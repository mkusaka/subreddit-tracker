Hi,

Our company has a single account that has both dev and production environments, I was wondering, is it good practice, if we both have a dev and prod database to put each into their own private subnet and also onto their own individual VPC?

I spun up some workspaces that work really well but the managers are wanting the users to have webcams for their meetings. I've been doing some research and even saw an old thread on here saying that WSP Beta could do this. But after spinning up an instance I still couldn't get it working. Does anyone else have any other ideas? 



The workspaces I'm testing on are the Performance PCoIP and Performance WSP

 Hey Guys,

I have a quick question about encryption in transit inside AWS and was hoping someone could help me with!

Does AWS automatically encrypt all data in transit inside AWS with TLS 1.3 (e.g. data moving from a lambda function to a Dynamo table)

Thanks in advance!

Is this available? I know that their docs are all available as markdown on Github, but I don't know which tool to use to build it. Pandoc dosnt automatically build and insert the files referenced by index.md.

I am considering going completely cloud. After a year or two of carrying around bulky expensive laptops (which inevitably die or require extensive repairs) , I've migrated much of my setup to AWS. The one bit that is missing is graphical apps like Adobe CC. Is this feasible at all?

Assuming I have a good connection, can I run Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere on AppStream? I don't intend to do anything particularly intensive. I code mostly, but oftentimes come in contact with graphical assets, hence the need.
