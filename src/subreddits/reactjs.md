We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I'm experimenting with live streaming right now, and what I want to do is create a simple react app that takes a webcam stream, broadcasts it to AWS medialive for ingest. Then, I want AWS to bounce the stream back to the react app, which displays it.

Is it possible? Could I leverage any existing web technologies to do it? 

So far, I've managed to create a MediaStream object client side, but I'm unsure as to what library to use to broadcast it properly. Would anyone have any advice for me, or be able to point me in the right direction?

I am working on my first full-stack project ATM and so far, I have only created project folder few times with CRA then immediately discarded everything because I can't decide on how to structure the project folder. 

I checked few boilerplates and projects, it seems there are different approaches. Some people keep server and client in two completely different project folders with their own package.json files and some people create server and client folders directly under the src folder, so everything is managed within the same repo. I do not want to start from scratch once and refactor everything once I start writing some code so I want to know for sure what the best practice is before diving into it.

I'd like to go with the "one client, one server folder under src" approach but, to be honest, I could not configure react-scripts to look into src/client instead of src â˜º

Are there any guides or articles you people can send me?

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working with ReactJS with a year or so. I learned mostly through Youtube and Udemy courses. Hence I wanted to get my hands on advanced react concepts but could not find any. There are no such udemy courses or youtube for intermediate to advance developers.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I proceed?
