After 3 month studying ruby 4 hours in week I finally made something useful.

[https://github.com/brian7346/Clean-downloads/blob/master/cleanup.rb](https://github.com/brian7346/Clean-downloads/blob/master/cleanup.rb)

Here's my program that clean my "Downloads" folder. It takes about 2-3 hours to build it.

[Example of how this is useful](https://preview.redd.it/w4f8klc533n41.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a612f6e7f02fa1d0a8e8aa4afab1418fe1ba3e2f)

I've been learning Ruby for several months now, and making my own Telegram bot with Ruby (using [telegram-bot gem](https://github.com/atipugin/telegram-bot-ruby)). These are helpers I've built during that time to help myself with that. I'm not a professional developer (yet :3), so the choices in the structure and the code itself might seem questionable. I don't feel like building a full-fledged gem with it, so I'll just leave a link:  [https://github.com/bulgakke/telegram\_bot\_helpers](https://github.com/bulgakke/telegram_bot_helpers)

Even if you feel you don't need it and you can do it better than me, or you can't bother reading someone else's home project, just take a look and maybe you'll better understand how to encapsulate stuff while working with Telegram Bot API

Is this a common issue? I have a gets.chomp towards the end but it wonâ€™t run the preceding code (most puts statements) until I enter a value for the gets statements. Is this a normal problem to run into?
