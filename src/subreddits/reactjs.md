Hi guys!

As most of us are aware, there are always multiple ways to implement a feature correctly. And there will also always be room for improvement.

Since we can always improve on a solution, the question then becomes, when are we done implementing something? My approach has been to ask myself these questions, and if I can answer yes to all of them, then I'm done:

1. Does it fill the requirements?
2. If someone touched the code for the feature and broke it, would that person have a way to know it? And also to know where exactly it broke?
3. If someone wanted to change the feature, would that person know where to look and what to change? 
4. In need of a future to refactor, is the feature organized such that I can do it a little at a time without breaking functionality?

This has been my definition of done that helps me deal with the tight schedule deadlines that are normal in software projects.

So I was wondering, what's your definition of done?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fvd1c9/react_components_library_with_typescript_and/

Hello. I am trying to create a React Components library using Typescript and styled-components. 
I don't want to use webpack or any unnecessary dependency.
Other projects should be able to install the library and use it straight away regardless of whether they use Typescript or not. But if they do, the library should provide all types.
I want to use tsc as a compiler, but I'm not really sure how my tsconfig and should look like. 
Also I've seen the use of index.d.ts files but I'm also not sure how to use it properly.

I want my directory tree to look like this, if possible:
```
/lib    # output of tsc
/src
    /assets    # any kind of assets like images, fonts, ...
        /fonts
    /components    # all useable components
        /forms
            /Button
                Button.tsx
                Button.style.ts
    /tests
    /theme    # for now here will be a theme.ts for all constants
    typings.d.ts    # typings for uncommon filetypes like *.ttf
package.json
tsconfig.json
Readme.md

```

Thank you for your help
## [8][What style of functions do you prefer to use in React and why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fvd0h9/what_style_of_functions_do_you_prefer_to_use_in/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fvd0h9/what_style_of_functions_do_you_prefer_to_use_in/

Hey, I'm new to using react and seen various function styles thrown around. I was wondering what type people follow and why? For example:

    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    
    const Message1 = (props) =&gt; (
      &lt;div&gt;{props.message}&lt;/div&gt;
    );
    
    const Message2 = (props) =&gt; (
      &lt;div&gt;{props.message}&lt;/div&gt;
    );
    
    const Message3 = ({ message }) =&gt; (
      &lt;div&gt;{message}&lt;/div&gt;
    );
    
    function Message4(props) {
      return &lt;div&gt;{props.message}&lt;/div&gt;
    }
    
    function App() {
      return (
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;Message1 message="How" /&gt;
          &lt;Message2 message="you" /&gt;
          &lt;Message3 message="doin" /&gt;
          &lt;Message4 message="Today?" /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    }
    
    export default App;

Why declare a constant instead of a function? Why are variables placed in the `{}`?
## [9][What do you use to convert Keys from Snake Case to Camel Case of the payload you receive from backend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fvak6m/what_do_you_use_to_convert_keys_from_snake_case/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fvak6m/what_do_you_use_to_convert_keys_from_snake_case/
---
The response from backend I get always will have snake case keys, and I would like to convert them to cameCase for compatibility  with other JS ecosystem variable names. How do you deal with this in your project? Lodash has a [method](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#camelCase) to convert it, but nothing to do it recursively if I give it any size of payload of different structure.

What is an effective and secure example of a Higher Order Component in React that prevents a logged in user from say:

1. Viewing the sign in / sign up page
2. Viewing pages that are for "admin" only

And what about for Users that have not yet signed in:

* How to prevent user from access pages that logged in users can view?

Here's my current example, which is terrible I know, help appreciated!

    import { Query } from "react-apollo";
    import { CURRENT_USER_QUERY } from "./User";
    import LogIn from "./LogIn";
    
    const PleaseSignIn = props =&gt; (
        &lt;Query query={CURRENT_USER_QUERY}&gt;
            {({ data, loading }) =&gt; {
                if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
                if (!data.me) return &lt;LogIn /&gt;;
                return props.children;}}
        &lt;/Query&gt;);
    
    export default PleaseSignIn;
