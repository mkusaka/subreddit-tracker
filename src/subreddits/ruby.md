Recently I've been trying to figure out how to Dockerize a Rails application. I'm finding it really hard and the documentation available online doesn't seem that good. So I decided to make things a little easier and try to Dockerize a Sinatra application first.

Here's how I did it. It's a step-by-step tutorial which also includes a video and Git repo.

Hey channel,  
After \~10y working with Ruby, always using ubuntu and osx, I am now planning to work/code from the windows 10 directly.   
What do you think about this approach?  


I could have a Virtualbox with ubuntu for code, but not sure if the T480s i5 processor will be enough to have a nice experience on it.  


I heard that windows now have some new terminal stuff.. Anyone with similar situation that wanna share some knowledge here?
