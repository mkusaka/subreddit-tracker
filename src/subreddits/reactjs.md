Hi there!

Probably some of you know about [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). It is the website built for competitive programmers to let them practice their problem-solving skills.

I have built an app [Laddy](https://laddy.app) that shows problems for your Codeforces rating so you can solve them and improve throughout the time. This app is inspired by [A2OJ](https://www.a2oj.com/) which is retired by now.

Even though if you are not into competitive programming, you will be probably interested in the source code of Laddy which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/ironsoul0/laddy). It uses some cool technologies under the hood like TypeGraphQL, TypeORM, React + Typescript, Lerna for managing the monorepo, etc.

Any suggestions for code improvement are more than welcome!

I was curious how you approach the design of your react applications? I really don‚Äôt enjoy design and, while I know enough CSS to get the job done, it‚Äôs not something I want to spend a ton of time on. There is a part of me that is thinking ‚Äúhey, it would be great to just purchase a template or hire a front-end dev to do the heavy lifting‚Äô.  So, for others like me, those who don‚Äôt really focus on design, how do you do it?

Some instructors are amazing when it comes to covering the theoretical part of React, but they don't come up with the most interesting projects. Instead, they teach you how to build a bare-bone project. I am wondering who you would recommend if you want to make interesting projects.
## [8][How to check if a boolean is true and then push it to the nested array](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ey6zbj/how_to_check_if_a_boolean_is_true_and_then_push/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ey6zbj/how_to_check_if_a_boolean_is_true_and_then_push/
---
At this moment the comments will be pushed inside the array, but then I click on a placed comment, and put some text in the input field and click on add...it should be pushed into the nested array. Looking at the comments, it should check if enableReply is set on true, if that is the case then new added comment should be pushed into this index in a nested array. So my question is, how should I do that. Another possible option is to first check if enableReplyComment is set on true before it go deeper to the comments array and check the enableReply if this was being set on true.

Hi all.  Several months ago I created my first React app, using [create React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).  I haven't updated any dependencies since then, and just had a look at `npm outdated`.  It reports that react-scripts is outdated.  But its wanted version does not match its latest version ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/xMEK7Kz.png)).  I guess that is expected, since my package.json lists it without a carat:

      "dependencies": {
        "react": "^16.8.5",
        "react-dom": "^16.8.5",
        "react-scripts": "2.1.8",
        "react-transition-group": "^4.2.0"
      },

But does anyone know why this dependency doesn't have a carat?  Should I add one?

Thanks in advance.
