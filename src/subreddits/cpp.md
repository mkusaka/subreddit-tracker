**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I use visual studio and the debugger is pretty fantastic but in some edge cases it would be handy to use print debugging. What is your favourite way to employ print debugging? Do you keep the print statements in a separate git branch to keep them from polluting the code?

*Disclaimer: this is a question I submitted to Stack Overflow a week ago [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/61410959/147192), and for which I am surprised not to have received any answer yet.*

The following code compiles with GCC 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x, but fails to compile with Clang:

    #include &lt;utility&gt;

    struct Friend {
        class Inner {
            friend struct Friend;

            int function() { return 0; }
        };

        using DirectResult = decltype(std::declval&lt;Inner&gt;().function());

        template &lt;typename T&gt;
        using IndirectResult = decltype(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().function());
    };

    int main() {
        Friend::DirectResult direct{};
        Friend::IndirectResult&lt;Friend::Inner&gt; indirect{};
        return direct + indirect;
    }

You can view the failure [on godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/uy-zVs):

    &lt;source&gt;:13:55: error: 'function' is a private member of 'Friend::Inner'    
        using IndirectResult = decltype(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().function());
                                                          ^
    &lt;source&gt;:18:13: note: in instantiation of template type alias 'IndirectResult' requested here
        Friend::IndirectResult&lt;Friend::Inner&gt; indirect{};
                ^

Clang does not complain about `DirectResult` accessing the privates of `Inner`, but complains about `IndirectResult` doing so. Various variations lead to different results.

It was brought to my attention that this seems similar to [this Clang bug](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25334), filed 5 years ago, and still unanswered.

As a result, I still haven't figured out whether my code is **correct or not** according to the standard, and I would appreciate help in elucidating this mystery.

Hi. I want to share code snippet that helps me to auto install conan deps during cmake configure step for C++ project.

Useful if you want to use IDE that auto-creates build and configure directories (like QT).

I hope it will be useful to someone.
