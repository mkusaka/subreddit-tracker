[structure-aware &amp; coverage-guided fuzzing engine written in Rust](https://github.com/loiclec/fuzzcheck-rs). I also asked a few questions about how I could go forward with the project.\n\nSince then, I have set up a GitHub Sponsors [page](https://github.com/sponsors/loiclec) and Embark Studios was kind enough to sponsor me, which has helped the project a lot. So thank to them!\n\nA few of you suggested projects I could fuzz-test. I did it shortly for a couple of them to profile fuzzcheck\u2019s performance and got some huge gains thanks to it. But I am not ready to create proper benchmarks yet, due to a lack of resources and time.\n\nI have also improved the corpus shrinking algorithm, created a configuration file to allow greater control of the instrumentation used, and added preliminary support for stack-depth-guided fuzzing.\n\nFinally, I was also told providing a proc_macro to generate mutators would help drive adoption. With the release of fuzzcheck 0.4.0, that proc_macro is finally there!\n\nNow you can write things like:\n\n    #[fuzzcheck_derive_mutator(DefaultMutator)]\n    #[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]\n    pub enum SampleEnum&lt;T&gt; {\n        A(u8),\n        B { x: bool , y: Option&lt;T&gt; },\n        C,\n        D\n    }\n\n    #[fuzzcheck_derive_mutator(DefaultMutator)]\n    #[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]\n    pub struct SampleStruct&lt;A, B, C&gt; {\n        a: A,\n        b: Vec&lt;B&gt;,\n        c: C\n    }\n\nto make these types fuzz-able. This means that, finally, fuzzcheck is approaching `cargo-fuzz`\u2019s ease of use! I am very excited about it, even though it is not very polished yet. I have carried some initial tests, and it seems so far that fuzzcheck\u2019s structure-aware mutators are much, much better and faster than what cargo-fuzz can provide with the `Arbitrary`trait. On many very simple tests, fuzzcheck would find a solution almost instantly while cargo-fuzz was still running 1 minute later. Of course, it doesn't mean that it will consistently outperform it, but it is encouraging nonetheless.\n\nIf you'd like to try it, it is easy and only takes a couple minute to run the sample fuzz-test.

I also asked a few questions about how I could go forward with the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have set up a GitHub Sponsors &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/loiclec\"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; and Embark Studios was kind enough to sponsor me, which has helped the project a lot. So thank to them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few of you suggested projects I could fuzz-test. I did it shortly for a couple of them to profile fuzzcheck\u2019s performance and got some huge gains thanks to it. But I am not ready to create proper benchmarks yet, due to a lack of resources and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have also improved the corpus shrinking algorithm, created a configuration file to allow greater control of the instrumentation used, and added preliminary support for stack-depth-guided fuzzing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was also told providing a proc_macro to generate mutators would help drive adoption. With the release of fuzzcheck 0.4.0, that proc_macro is finally there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you can write things like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#[fuzzcheck_derive_mutator(DefaultMutator)]\n#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]\npub enum SampleEnum&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {\n    A(u8),\n    B { x: bool , y: Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; },\n    C,\n    D\n}\n\n#[fuzzcheck_derive_mutator(DefaultMutator)]\n#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]\npub struct SampleStruct&amp;lt;A, B, C&amp;gt; {\n    a: A,\n    b: Vec&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;,\n    c: C\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to make these types fuzz-able. This means that, finally, fuzzcheck is approaching &lt;code&gt;cargo-fuzz&lt;/code&gt;\u2019s ease of use! I am very excited about it, even though it is not very polished yet. I have carried some initial tests, and it seems so far that fuzzcheck\u2019s structure-aware mutators are much, much better and faster than what cargo-fuzz can provide with the &lt;code&gt;Arbitrary&lt;/code&gt;trait. On many very simple tests, fuzzcheck would find a solution almost instantly while cargo-fuzz was still running 1 minute later. Of course, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it will consistently outperform it, but it is encouraging nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to try it, it is easy and only takes a couple minute to run the sample fuzz-test. Go to &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/loiclec/fuzzcheck-rs\"&gt;https://github.com/loiclec/fuzzcheck-rs&lt;/a&gt; and follow the usage instructions :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for the update.

mobile/linux-based OS. I'm very new to rust as a language so excuse my misuse of terms.\n\nI want to find an incantation to just build the arm target version of the std/core crates that come with rust. I do not need an arm-hosted rustc. We rebuild the entire OS regularly using a dependency cycle and reproducable bit-identical packages. Because these builds happen so much we try to only build what we need. This is the high-level reason we don't want to build an arm rustc.\n\nMy assumption is that given an x86 rustc binary (--print target-list has armv7) and no ARM binary crates, I can build the ARM crates from scratch from source. If this is wrong then I can stop looking :)\n\n(aside: We use an unusual cross-building system (which works well with rustc). Executables run on x86 hw in a qemu chroot. For build-time performance we use low-level system call intercepts to invoke x86-hosted binaries to bypass emulation.

I do not need an arm-hosted rustc. We rebuild the entire OS regularly using a dependency cycle and reproducable bit-identical packages.

I wanted to share a bit of our current story and some thoughts of the architecture I'm pursuing to hear the opinion of the community about possible limitations, areas of improvement or any random comment you guys have.

I'm responsible mostly for the system's security which in our early stages mostly means making design decisions that will keep our attack surface as small as possible by making certain attack vectors impossible by design. Big part of it is the use of Rust which the team is already onboard with and started learning already, other design decisions include for the longer term \"blockchainizing\" and decentralizing our product.\n\nNow comes the monolith vs micro-service discussion. Typical story here, like with most start-ups the company started with its rushed MVP quality monolith that grew and lasted longer than it should have, with the many mistakes that curse monoliths like bad coupling among components, not well defined domains and dependencies, shared global state, etc, then it transitioned(perhaps to early) to  a micro-service kubernetes based architecture like all \"cool kids\" do nowadays, sadly and not surprisingly implemented in not the best way, with still a lot of coupling plus the many not well handled complexities of the new infrastructure and it's elevated costs.

Doesn't this look like just a bigger more complex monolith?  \n\nNow with Rust already being acknowledged as a reality and necessity for the core of our product I propose to extend its reach to basically everything, one mono repo, one service service to rule them all. My rationale and assumption being, a Rust monolith \"done well\" can scale just as good or better, scaling not by adding more metal to the mix but by making things faster and simpler. It's not only about the time we cut form a node.js service handling some logic vs what Rust takes in comparison but also the network round trips, (de)serialization or data base look-ups(sled? embedded db dangerous?) etc, I think we can shave up lots of precious CPU cycles there! \n\nThen there's still the issue of scalability on the code base level, how to grow a healthy code base and avoid things getting all tangled and coupled together again, minimize global mutable state and retain simplicity? For this I think restricting developer's \"creativity\" is a good approach, to avoid foot shoots by following well known design patterns. The first building block I thought about was an actor system that could help with reliable delivery of messages between components, and keeping things running, also to enforce go's mantra of sharing by communicating and not communicating by sharing memory(avoid global state at least among the main components of the system). Didn't find a lot of offer in the actor frameworks department but started to play with [Riker](https://riker.rs/) which seemed simple enough and not too focused on HTTP+REST like actix, could be more mature but so far is proving itself useful.  Then to further \"restrict creativity\" started to play with an [event sourcing+CQRS abstraction](https://github.com/Valiuapp/riker-es) on top of the actor framework hoping it can be a good balance of flexibility with \"there should be just one obvious way to do things\". When it comes to storing data, I'm very tempted to have a [Sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled) backed, embedded event store to align with my future hopes of decentralization and the whole system being a single binary, double-click kind of thing that others can easily deploy and run in their own machines to serve a few hundreds or thousands of customers. It's well received in the company by now that our future might look more as like decentralized organization, focusing mostly on a specific geography and letting others like us pop up in other parts of the world to build a bigger whole. Am I being to idealistic thinking some young libraries can replace a more traditional architecture? specially on the DB side not using one of the (no)SQL DBs that we all know and love. How much of a risky move is it to build on top of experimental tech for a thing that is built to last? How far can this get us before we really need more instances? How long can vertical scaling take me? What if management says a couple of years down the line that we are not betting on decentralization, we need to serve millions of users on our own, shouldn't be that hard to break down the monolith down the line but there might be troubles I can't see?
