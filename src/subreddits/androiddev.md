This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [9][Developing an android application in MVP pattern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i433w7/developing_an_android_application_in_mvp_pattern/)

Hello, I have two questions about the application that I am developing

&amp;#x200B;

Question 1:

I have been trying to follow the MVP pattern to develop an android application. My application would have a lot of interaction with the SQL server for fetch and update operations, my question is where should I perform all the database related operations in? Do I perform it in Presenter or Model? Also I have been using AsyncTask to perform these operations.

Question2:

How many is the acceptable amount of frames to be skipped. I was getting 1 frames skipped  but when I added an image to the activity I am getting 27 frames skipped, should I perform further optimizations or I can do without them?

Thank you.
