Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I'm kinda new to C++. Hope this is the right sub to ask this..

Suppose you have 100GB file (one database record per line) and 16GB RAM. And you need to read/update/delete records depending on the query. Is constructing ifstream and read line by line good way to do this? From my understanding, in this case every read/write is a disk IO, right? Is there better way to do this in terms of performance?

I am creating a web service on top of asio and beast. I was wondering if there where any good user management libraries I can use instead of rolling it on my own? 

I found this : 
https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/tutorial/auth.html

Any advice on whether this is a dumb idea? I could split up the user management into a different service using a different language stack like nodejs which has a lot of good libraries for doing things like this. 

But then I would have to maintain two language stacks, care about their deployment etc. 
Plus I would be able to handle more users on single box using cpp compared to nodejs. ( With a high probability ) If anyone else has done something like this, any numbers? 

I need the cpp server for the core functionality due to problem I am tackling! 

Thanks!
