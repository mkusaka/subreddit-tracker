Hi, I’ve been using javascript professionally for years, keeping up with the latest language updates and still  I’ve never used a generator function. I know how they work, but I don’t believe I’ve come across a reason where they are useful—but they must be there for a reason.

Can someone provide me with a case where they’ve been useful? Would love to hear some real world examples.

I have a technical interview coming up soon, and I'm planning on using JavaScript because I feel the most comfortable with it. Now, my concern is that do I need to avoiding over using some of the built-in linear time functions (i.e. splice, unshift, etc.), if there is a more optimized implementation without abusing the built-in functions.

I was told by a senior software engineer/technical interviewer that if your solution isn't the most optimized, you're out. Is that also the case using JavaScript because I also heard that people who use JavaScript in real world projects, they rarely encounter performance issues, nor do they worry about what's the time complexity of the algo they implemented. (Ofc, if one's hitting it with double or triple for loops everywhere, that's a different story.)

All in all, any advice/tips for using JavaScript in technical interviews is appreciated!
