This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Have there been any noticeable lifecycle changes on Android 11 that anyone has noticed? 

&amp;#x200B;

My app works fine on pre-Android 11 OSes but on my Pixel 4 is crashing out everytime with the error: 

E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main  


java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fragment host has been destroyed

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything under the hood that anyone else has noticed to just affect their app on Android 11?

Yes, The app that brings you IOS 14 feature of showing you an indication when a third party apps or services use your device camera or microphone. 

I tryed to recreate that for android. Currently, it shows a green (cam) &amp; orange (mic) dot on the top right or left corner of your screen when an app uses your camera or microphone.

Has there been any changes to RemoteView in Android 11. In my existing apps for displaying larger images on notification, which works fine on &lt;=Android 10 devices, earlier I was seeing an error printed that 'Removed too large RemoteViews'. But this has now been switched to a warning 'RemoteViews too large on this might be stripped in a future release'.  
Are any of these changes documented for Android 11.

To not  have conflicts with source files if there is an update etc... Is it  possible to overwrite a feature or design by adding code that don't  touch the source files ?  
I looked at differents repo like Lawnchair for example and they have inside the project of launcher 3 their own folder with their source files, is this a good practice ?
