This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I took inspiration from [r/ITCareerQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/) and I want to hear on the Android Developers specifically so I want to hear the harsh truths that newcomers should know before choosing to be a Android Developer?

Also, do you have to be good at Math? Or a College Degree would help or required?

I want to promote a service without AdMob, but using my custom native ad banner (ImageView for icon, TextView for text, and Button in a LinearLayout). I am trying to find the rules regarding this without much luck, and certainly don't want to get the app removed from Play Store. Asking Google directly (through Play Console help email or chat) doesn't help as the answer is just that they can't comment on specific implementations, but the ads should respect their policies, which they do (I make sure the service that I promote fits into [Google Ads Policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en) as well as [Google Play Developer Policies (Ads section)](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9857752)).  


However, there is no clear example about custom banner ads. I tried replicating AdMob banner ad and added a small "Ad ðŸ›ˆ" attribution text to bottom left of the banner. If clicked, it redirects to privacy policy of my app. Is this required?  


Otherwise, if user clicks anywhere inside of the banner ad, he gets redirected to promoted website.  


Does this sound alright? Anyone tried to do it before?

Could you guys recommend some good phones for testing during development of the Android version of my app? I've been out of the mobile dev game for nearly 2 years and unsure which phones are most representative of the current Android user landscape.

One or two phones that are cheap, popular and typical of what an Android phone offers these days. Any ideas? Thanks guys

Hello, I am trying to edit the voice files in an apps obb with custom English lines instead of the current language that I cannot understand. The problem is that whenever I make any changes to the obb and save it to the folder, the app fails to load up. It gives me a "download failed because you might not have purchased the app". Is there any way around this? Thank you.

Iâ€™m developing for android from past 4 years and so far i have good experience in android, now i want to try out iOS development, but for that i need to purchase MBP, so thatâ€™s why before making investment in MacBook i want to know howâ€™s your experience in developing for both platforms? How successfully we can develop for both ? 

i know at starting it might be difficult but i think if i have experience in android development then it is also going to help me to develop for iOS. because at end we have to do same things but in iOS style. 

so please let me know how many people here are developing for both and how is your experience?
