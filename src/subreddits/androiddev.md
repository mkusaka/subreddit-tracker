* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Like can you come up with anything you want? Epic Durability Gamee Entertainment, Lappendixois Studios, etc...

Do you have to register or copyright your name? How do you prove it or back it up?

Or you just use your real name? But then that will show up also for the customers in the bank statements. Or you just use your game's name? But whag if you release 2 games, then you cant do that

I am currently looking for a solution to charge a company for the usage of my app based on the amount of users they buy a license for. For example, a company has 1000 devices. I want them to pay 2$ per device. The payment should reoccur annually. If the user/company does not pay for the service they don’t have access anymore.

My idea was to let them buy an annual subscription per device via in app purchase, but I don’t know if that is possible to handle for enterprise apps. Does someone here have experience in that field or had a similar requirement?
It would be nice, if I could achieve this with the google play Store
