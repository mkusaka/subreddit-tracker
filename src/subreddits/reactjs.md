We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Redia is a web framework that uses React Hooks for declarative request/response handling. It exposes common hooks like `useState`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, etc, and additionally has support for built-in server-related custom hooks like `useRouter` and `useStatic`.

### Rationale

The lot of web frameworks out in the wild have either poor ([Express](https://expressjs.com/)) or over-engineered ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)) architectures. Redia exhibits a low-level server API with high-level abstractions.

[Here's the link](https://github.com/redia-server/redia). It is still experimental, so enjoy! :)

I recently got my first internship, thanks to this subreddit but in the first project I am working on.I need a system to count how much time student spend on each question in an exam in a hard to exploit manner.

&amp;#x200B;

Pinging to back-end is not an option and I have to handle it on the front-end.

  
PS:Also wanna check when user closes browser or minimize it or changes tab.

im starting with react and im curious whether this is correct code split into components, or maybe i overdid it a little? example of couple chained components:

    const Navigation = ({ children }) =&gt; {
    
        const [sideMenuOn, toggleSideMenu] = useState(false);
    
        const handleSideMenuToggle = () =&gt; toggleSideMenu(!sideMenuOn);
    
        return(
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;NavBar 
                    toggleSideMenu={ handleSideMenuToggle }
                    children={ children }
                /&gt;
                &lt;SideMenu
                    toggleSideMenu={ handleSideMenuToggle }
                    sideMenuOn={ sideMenuOn }
                /&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
    
    
    const SideMenu = ({ sideMenuOn, toggleSideMenu }) =&gt; {
    
        const width = sideMenuOn ? '25%' : '0%';
        const backgroundStyle = sideMenuOn 
            ? ({
                opacity: '1',
                zIndex: '10'
            }) : ({
                opacity: '0',
                zIndex: '-1'
            })
    
        return(
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;div className="side-menu" style={{ width }}&gt;
                    &lt;SideMenuContent toggleSideMenu={ toggleSideMenu }/&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div className="side-background" style={ backgroundStyle } onClick={ toggleSideMenu }&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
    
    
    const SideMenuContent = ({ toggleSideMenu }) =&gt; {
    
        const [loggedIn, toggleLoggedIn] = useState(false);
    
        const handleLoggedInToggle = () =&gt; {
            toggleLoggedIn(!loggedIn);
        }
    
        const content = loggedIn 
            ? &lt;UserContent 
                toggleSideMenu={ toggleSideMenu } 
                toggleLoggedIn={ handleLoggedInToggle } /&gt; 
            : &lt;GuestContent 
                toggleSideMenu={ toggleSideMenu } 
                toggleLoggedIn={ handleLoggedInToggle } 
            /&gt;;
    
        return content;
    }

and then there are 3 parts of the side menu showing different content for logged in user / guest user logging in / signing up which all have the same template but rendering different content like 'welcome back' vs 'log in in header title' etc:

    const UserContent  = ({ toggleSideMenu, toggleLoggedIn }) =&gt; {
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;header&gt;
                    &lt;div className="title"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Welcome back
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;i className="fas fa-times" onClick={toggleSideMenu}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;  
                    &lt;div className="user"&gt;
                        &lt;img src="https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/img/default-avatars/generic-user-purple.png" alt=""/&gt;
                        &lt;div className="text-holder"&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;logedinusern@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;free verzia&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt; 
                &lt;/header&gt;
                &lt;main&gt;
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;home&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;add city&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li onClick={ toggleLoggedIn }&gt;log out&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/main&gt;
                &lt;footer&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Copyright Â© 2020 Bmby&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/footer&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }

which could be mybe split into another couple components like header/body/footer to avoid jsx repetition?

## [11][Anyone here use restful URLS instead of storing values in redux (for deep linking, and not using redux for small things)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iecfe3/anyone_here_use_restful_urls_instead_of_storing/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iecfe3/anyone_here_use_restful_urls_instead_of_storing/
---
I am curious if the pattern of using restful urls is something react devs are using. I am weighing the pro'/cons.... what is your experience.  


For example. In a normal single page app, we can "edit a product".  


    url: mywebsite/products
==&gt; Store in redux the current selected product, its id.
==&gt; Editing? Set "edit" mode in redux or react-router
    or

    url: mywebsite/products/444
url: mywebsite.com/products/444/edit

The pros of "restful urls" is that I can deeplink, if I refresh, I can resaturate based on the id &amp; mode in url. The cons, I feel is that I am passing around these values "444" "edit" in my link components and such...and then I have get them, pass them..  


So, I am not sure if I am getting readability at the expense of over complicating the code.  
What is your experience? What have you used and any shortcuts, librariees that help this out?
