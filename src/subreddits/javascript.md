So I write a template element, I `document.importNode` it, but now I want to get references to specific nodes to add event listeners, insert content, etc. What is the best way to do that?

* In the past I would use `getElementById()` or `querySelector()` but I think these are a single DOM traversal each.
* I've been using comment nodes and then using a `treeWalker` that is filtered to just comment nodes. Then I get access to the `.nextElementSibling` and add my listener to that.  This is what lit-html does I think?

Are there any other ways?

There was a proposal for a template instantiation API, but it had a render function and Handlebars syntax which I wasn't interested in.

Lastly, I've thought that maybe having a &lt;marker&gt; node that you could somehow clone the template and then have direct access to all the marker nodes within the template could be a way of solving template instantiation.  It would tell the parser that you want to access this node from JavaScript later so it should make a reference available.  What do you think about that?

For background, I built a framework for webhosting with NodeJS, aptly named [webhoster](https://github.com/clshortfuse/webhoster). Zero dependencies, leans to allowing full control over all aspects of request/respond system, pure Javascript, all ES modules, documented with types for TS, blah, blah, blah. I like it. I want to share it. But I don't think people should use something without tests.

So, I feel like I have to get started with the tests I need to build. I've built tests before for `angular/material` which seems to use `karma` and `jasmine`. It was weird, but I managed. I've done some for `cssnano` which is `jest`. A little less confusing, but pretty okay. The latest ones I've done were for `nodejs/node` and it uses regular only `.js` files and as long as `assert()` doesn't throw an error. I liked the simplicity of that, but don't know about the long-term consequences.

I don't know what I should choose, because "choose what you like" doesn't really inspire confidence. One may be less strenuous, but it doesn't mean it's best. I don't know about code coverage and stuff either, since I usually just submit PRs and the packages I've used already have everything like `travis` already setup.

So any community-based guidance as to what works, what doesn't, and what's better long-term would be appreciated. Thanks!
