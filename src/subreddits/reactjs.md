Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

Hey guys. Just wondering if anyone has some good resources / books / materials that helps beginners understand the best practices in React.

One thing I struggle with is knowing when something should be a component. 

For example, when I'm making forms, should each field input be a component? If so, what's the benefit of doing that?

I have a functional component which makes an async call inside useEffect. I am trying to test two scenarios, once when the fetching is happening and the other one where the value is received.I am able to test whether the async function is called or not! but it seems the state change is not happening properly.

    //My FuncComponent
    import React, { useState } from 'react'; import { dataFetcher } from '../helper/datafetcher';
    const FuncComponent = (props) =&gt; {
    
      const [isFetching, setFetchingState] = useState(false);
    
      const dataFetching = async () =&gt; {
        try {
          setFetchingState(true);
          console.log(isFetching);
          const res = await dataFetcher();
          setFetchingState(false);
          console.log(res, isFetching);
        } catch (error) {
          console.log(error);
        }    
      };
    
      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        dataFetching();
    
        return () =&gt; {
          setFetchingState(false);
        };
      }, []);
      
      return(
        &lt;div&gt;
          {isFetching ? (&lt;div&gt;Loading..&lt;/div&gt;) : (&lt;div&gt;Someshit!&lt;/div&gt;)}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    }
    
    export default FuncComponent;

My unit test file

    //FuncComponent.test.jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import FuncComponent from './FuncComponent';
    import * as datafetcher from '../helper/datafetcher';
    import { mount, configure, shallow } from 'enzyme';
    import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';
    import { act } from '@testing-library/react';
    configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
    
    datafetcher.dataFetcher = jest.fn(() =&gt; Promise.resolve({data: "something",}));
    let component;
    
    describe('component renders', () =&gt; {
    
        test('async function called', () =&gt; {
            // component = shallow(&lt;FuncComponent /&gt;);
            component = mount(&lt;FuncComponent /&gt;);
            expect(datafetcher.dataFetcher).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
            console.log(component.debug());
        }) 
    }); 

The above test is running successfully, able to track the function call. But the state change is not happening, still showing "Loading..." text even after the Promise is resolved.
## [6][Help/discuss: choosing between CSS architectures for my React app (styled-components vs. css-modules, etc.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f4idcc/helpdiscuss_choosing_between_css_architectures/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f4idcc/helpdiscuss_choosing_between_css_architectures/

I am building my first complex desktop app with a react frontend. I am now reviewing CSS architectures and selecting one, and have comments and questions regarding what's available.

Vanilla CSS has known issues such as its default inheritance model and monolithic nature which can become convoluted with a web app that has many moving parts. A solution is to create modular CSS that can be arbitrarily composed and reused.

It seems that JS-in-CSS libraries allow for **CSS** composition, BUT this CSS is coupled to JS components, reducing its composability. Obviously CSS being in the JS files furthers this coupling. From the HTML standpoint, this also seems to reduce flexibility since classes are replaced with concretized styled "component-HTML-elements" (in the case of the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library, which is my primary point of reference). This seems to violate the semantic integrity of traditional HTML structuring and the implied pattern where HTML defines structure, classes define function/purpose/context, and the styles define appearance and stylistic behavior, hooking into HTML via selectors. This pattern allows for a degree separation of concerns that is desirable to me, but seems compromised in CSS-in-JS.

One great thing I see about CSS-in-JS is JS injection into template literals, but I don't know if the tradeoff is worthwhile given the above concerns.

The alternative to CSS-in-JS is [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), which seems to respect the structure-representation distinction while maintaining scope and composability via the "composes" keyword - but many developers say that it is inferior to styled-components in ways that don't seem justify its usage such as "less boilerplate code" or "I like having everything in my JS files" (is this always a good thing?).

I have not used these technologies in practice, so it is hard to conclusively judge them. Perhaps I am missing something, or their utility would be clearer upon usage? I would like to hear from devs more experienced with them, particularly clarifying why and when one should use styled-components or css-modules in your projects (or neither). Hopefully I can become more informed towards choosing an architecture to move forward with.

Hello!

I am very new to react and though I understand the concepts (in theory) I just cant seem to make sense of all of these fragment demands. I'm hoping for a nudge in the right direction.

In my App.js I have set out the state to be an array. I then want to call it in my component and use .map() to iterate through the array. Everything seems simple and smooth until I pop in my .map function. I understand that adjacent elements needs to be wrapped, but that doesn't seem to help me...

here is a codepen, but since I am using VScode, I am not sure if the layout is clear enought

otherwise, here are screenshots

MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO HELP THIS LOST BOY.

cheers.

I created this simple React library for creating Suspense resources much like the react-cache package, as a form of studying and experimenting the new React feature.

Resources created with this library can have caching strategies, and can also be reactive, meaning that Suspense-ful components can re-render automatically whenever the cache gets validated again.

Try it out!
