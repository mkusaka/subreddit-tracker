looking at a [hooks implementation](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/master/hooks/src/index.js) ... it looks like hooks are just one big globally shared state, with limitations in how to be used, instead of the state that used to be local per component.
So a pure DX optimization with traps, isn't it?
