I was talking to a friend recently and I told them I'm learning Ruby, to which they responded by saying Ruby has no actual market value today aside from Rails. Is that true? And Ruby Devs in the field today, what is your take on Ruby's relevance?

I've been doing the questions on codewars and for most of them that I have done concerning string manipulations, I have seen some of the top ranked answers using gsub to solve in one line what I solved in 9 or so. So my question is, does the use of .gsub improve time complexity of an algorithm and do you have any suggestions on the best places to learn and perfect its use?

There don't seem to be any performance improvements. Maybe bug fixes? I've only found one minor, but nice reason for me: Numbered Parameters for Blocks. This should combine nicely with `.then` allowing for nicer chaining with functions.
