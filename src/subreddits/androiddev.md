This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

How hard is it for someone with Android development experience to create their own REST API? Is this something that every Android dev should know how to do?

I have a couple project ideas that would require this, but no idea where to start (or if it's worth the time investment). I know Java/Kotlin but I have little experience outside of the Android framework.

Hey guys,

I am asking this question because I don't think it has been asked lately and all I find on the net is pretty old.
- How do you guys know when it is time to upgrade the minSdkVersion to a newer one? For me, as a rule of thumb, I would have try to choose the minimum sdk version based on having at least 95% of the android devices that are on the market.
- I don't think that [android dashboard](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) is reliable because it has not been updated for almost a year.
- is [@minSdkVersion](https://mobile.twitter.com/minsdkversion?lang=en) reliable?
- I have heard that pornhub have published what are their users' versions. Although it is a nice act, I don't think it is reliable enough.

Thanks a lot guys!

Hello, guys!  
I have written an article about sending logs from Android device via internet. Might be helpful if your client (or tester) is experiencing a bug and you need to debug it.  
**Hope you'll enjoy:**

This has been asked before, but there arent many threads about it. The problem at hand is getting apps full screen (aka "immersive mode") on devices with notches or hole punch cameras. Im using a S20 ultra but the question pertains to all phones since the s10 range. Currently its impossible to do without either rooting or using app cloner, but there are obvious drawbacks. A simple solution would be implementing a profile under developer options that simulates a screen without a notch. Currently there are only options to simulate screens with different notches. AFAIK the problem is that the hole punch is letterboxed so most apps render under this area. Is there anyone that can find a solution to remove this letterbox area? ANYONE??
