## [5][Why has my keyword ranking on the Play Store disappeared?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hee6sl/why_has_my_keyword_ranking_on_the_play_store/)

I have a couple of apps on the Play Store. They've been live for about 18 months.

They haven't performed particularly well - that's OK they're just small game apps. So recently I started to focus on keyword research and ASO. I made small incremental changes to the descriptions and other meta data each week and for the first three or four weeks it was going really well - on the Play Store my apps moved up from nowhere into the 20s and teens for long-tail keywords. Good progress, everything was moving in the right direction.

Then one day my apps just completely disappeared from the rankings. Just gone. If I type my app names into the search bar they don’t appear. If I type the names in with the spaces removed then they appear. But they’ve just disappeared from the keyword listings.

On AppAnnie, if I look at their keyword tool, my apps are now ranking for one single random word that appears just once in the description, usually around position 205. And it's position fluctuates constantly from one day to the next from 243, 247, 243, 247 etc...

Now If I look at the keyword rankings on AppAnnie even my app name doesn’t rank anymore. And there’s a particular date in late May where that happens. It’s ranking number one continually for the app name then on one particular date everything just stops as if it’s been turned off.

And in complete contrast to that on the iOS App Store the opposite is true - I’ve used the same descriptions - just copy/pasted and they’ve really taken off. I’m ranking number one for a certain key phrase (which admittedly doesn’t have the greatest reach) and in the top 10 for others.

For all intents and purposes my apps on the Play Store have simply disappeared from view. Any idea why this has happened? I’d done keyword research and was making positive progress then one day nothing - as if my apps had simply been switched off.

I’ve contacted Google Play Store support a couple of days ago to ask why this is but I’ve yet to get a reply.

Has this happened to anyone else?

It seems that TZDB of Android devices is updated by the device manufacturers. Can we pack the latest TZDB into our app and load it when initializing the app [just like ThreeTenABP](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP/blob/master/threetenabp/src/main/java/com/jakewharton/threetenabp/AndroidThreeTen.java#L22)?

The readme of ThreeTenABP suggests us to switch to Android Gradle plugin 4.0 and `java.time`, but seems it does not ship with the classes for dynamically changing the TZDB source.

Hello Android Dev's, so I have a simple question that I want an answer to:
I have an APP that is built on Android 28 API, and I have an SDK that is built on Android 29 API, I have checks on Runtime to see which version is running and what API to use, but, can I integrate an SDK that is built on API 29 into an APP that will be built on API 28? Thanks in advance!

I've recently started getting into Android app development and find the front-end stuff really tedious. Is there a website or other place where I can find sample layouts, Buttons, EditTexts, Spinners etc that I can simply copy the style I like into my own XML files from and make some changes as and when I need?
## [11][What's the best way of handling multithreading in Android?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hedcdb/whats_the_best_way_of_handling_multithreading_in/)

Few years ago when I took an Android course they suggested that I should use Asynctask for multithreading stuff, now I'm tinkering with Android again and the official docs say that Asynctask is deprecated and its telling me to use java.util.concurrent instead, I want to use kotlin coroutines but I need to learn kotlin for that.

I have heard that RxJava/RxAndroid is good and is a must learn for an Android developer. Should I learn it if I just want to just create a thread and do some processing?

What would you suggest for doing some multithreading stuff in Android and what's the current best practices right now?

Hi, newb Android dev here. I've been reading some scary posts on people getting their dev accounts terminated by Google. I read posts that suggest setting up an LLC even. I am trying to set up a new Google account just for learning and developing apps. Now, I'm not even close to making money from the Play Store, but would still like to be informed on what to do and what NOT to do. Any tips or advice would be appreciated!
