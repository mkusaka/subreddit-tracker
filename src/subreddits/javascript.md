Just trying to get pointed in the right direction.

https://cookiecad.com

The address posted takes an image that you upload and outputs a cookie cutter 3D file that you can 3D print. 

I can't for the life of me figure out what kind of script or backend they are using to do this can anyone point me in the right direction or help me out?

Sorry if this is not java. I wasn't sure where to start. 

Thank you

This isn't really *directly* related to JavaScript but I'm looking for JS developers who have worked with these kinds of requirements.

A friend and I are doing a side project together and we want to be able to concentrate on the frontend as much as possible (probably Gatsby or Next.js) but we still need some kind of backend storage and I'm keen to do as little work as possible in that area.

My friend is advocating for firebase and he makes a lot of compelling arguments for it; can host for free (at least initially), comes with auth, can interact with it directly without the need for a REST or GraphQL interface and no server maintenance. Plus all the firebase extras like auto-syncing, though I'm not particularly interested in realtime stuff it would be nice in some areas.

I'm suggesting strapi because I like the admin panel and REST/GraphQL is a paradigm I understand very well at this point. I would trust Postgres to safely store and index my firstborn child and I just like the predictability of it.

Just wondering if anyone has any insights into building stuff with either (as in real life experience) or if you can make any other suggestions that might fit.
