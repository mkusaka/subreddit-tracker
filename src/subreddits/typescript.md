I set up a project recently and I'm having issues compiling it and it seems to be because of my tsconfig file and node\_modules. As of now, my project contains a tsconfig file that looks like this:

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
        "module": "commonjs",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "types": [],
        "skipLibCheck": true
      },
      "exclude": [
        "node_modules"
      ]
    }

as well as a `package.json` and a `package-lock.json` file. Because I installed jest with npm, I have a `node_modules` folder as well as my own `src` folder. In the src folder, I only have one small file that I'm trying to run. When I use the command tsc src/main.ts I get an error: 

    node_modules/@types/babel__template/index.d.ts:16:28 - error TS2583: Cannot find name 'Set'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the `lib` compiler option to es2015 or later.
    
    16     placeholderWhitelist?: Set&lt;string&gt;;

I've searched the entire internet for a solution but none seem to work. Any suggestions would be really appreciated.

## [7][Yarn workspaces, create-react-app and express](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/g7eq4k/yarn_workspaces_createreactapp_and_express/)

Has anyone gotten yarn workspaces to work well for a single frontend + backend project? I want to have a structure like:

* package.json
* yarn.lock
* client/
   * package.json
   * src/
* server/
   * package.json
   * src/

&amp;#x200B;

But, I don't know how to have the "static files" generated by the client/ "create-react-app" be included as static files in the server/ "express" app. Do I have to do some kind of manual "cp" to get them over? I don't really understand how to configure the "static file" exports on the "client/" project so that the "server/" project can somehow include them and serve them.

I'm working on a typing test app in Angular, and in order to get the random list of words I store the result into a property. However it complains when I put a property at the beginning of the class that it is being used before declaration, look here to see where it's declared.  Then when I put it after the function declaration it tells me I should put the thing at the top of the file.  My application doesn't work if I put it at the top of the file. I don't like having warnings or errors in my code, so what's a good solution here? For now I've just stuck the property where it works and ignored the TS lint error.

I'm used to working with Python backends; what I'm looking for is something like [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) which uses type annotations to validate requests/response structures among other things. It's very handy. I've done a lot of looking but can't find a TypeScript-first API framework with similar features. Anyone have any recommendations?
