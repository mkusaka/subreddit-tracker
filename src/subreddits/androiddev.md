Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Cross-post from r/Kotlin, as this topic is a bit difficult to find answers to. I still havent had any luck. Basically what I have learned is that you need to test on real devices. But I still haven't gotten much luck when it comes to service types and names, to have those explained to me would be very helpful.

So how do you work with [NSD](https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/nsd) durning the production/ debugging? How do you test that it works properly? Could someone explain a little bit what "service type" and "service name" are. As service type when registering equals to \_http.\_tcp NO DOT, and when listening to a protocol it's with A DOT at the end. And an example for this with real machine (printer, PC, another phone). Like this is what I get when I run avahi-discover [https://imgur.com/a/DA7F14M](https://imgur.com/a/DA7F14M)  , if someone could use this an example to explain what is going on exactly.Thank you for your time. I am stuck on this for like 5 or so days. It's been frustrating. The examples online are horrible and just a copy paste of the documentation.

Im making a very very simple meditation app. The core of it is done but I want to be able to track daily streaks and display them in a neat minimalistic layout.   
I sorta have the [design](https://imgur.com/a/EKCafU7) in mind but don't really know where to start with coding it in. 
Any help would be appreciated.

I have a financial app to track daily expenses. Generally I get around 400 installs a day. For the last week I am seeing a decrease in download. (around 150 each day) and number of sessions are also less. Not sure if people are more engaged with the Corona issue worldwide and that is affecting the downloads. Is anyone experiencing a similar trend ?
## [10][Which ad network to use? How does AdMob compare to Appodeal and other networks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/flugxl/which_ad_network_to_use_how_does_admob_compare_to/)

What ad network are you using for your app?  


I am using AdMob, but wondering if there are other better ad networks.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Appdoeal. Is anyone here using it? How effective have you found it? Maybe there are better networks out there?

&amp;#x200B;

Any information would be much appreciated.
## [11][How to create Activity scoped ViewModel instance in Kodein?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/flubbo/how_to_create_activity_scoped_viewmodel_instance/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/flubbo/how_to_create_activity_scoped_viewmodel_instance/
---
I have tried this approach which obviously isn't working.

// In Kodein module

`bind&lt;HomeViewModel&gt;() with scoped(WeakContextScope.of&lt;Activity&gt;()).singleton{`  
 `KotlinViewModelProvider.of(context as FragmentActivity) {`  
 `HomeViewModel(instance())`  
 `}`  
`}`

// Calling it lazily from fragment

`private val mViewModel: HomeViewModel by kodein.on(this.activity).instance()`

This doesn't work, since it might be called before the fragment even attaches to the Activity. 

This is my first attempt to use DI, I started with Kodein, but this part of using, Activity context in binding isn't clear to me. Any help would be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.
