Question for go programmers that know some c#.  
[google-cloud-go](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go) **483.8k LOC**  
vs  
[google-cloud-dotnet](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet) **1.5m LOC**  


What is your subjective opinion about these repositories? Whose code is easier to maintain?

Is there a book, recent or old, on [Go Kit](https://gokit.io/) ? I have been looking for one for a while now. It is the last check I have to do before giving a try to [Go](https://golang.org/).

Good day to all,

I am trying to find a lib to facilitate my work with my next (mostly-curd) project in Golang.

I went for `gorm`, It is good, but I faced some issues with it and went through searching for other alternatives.

I used `sql` and `sqlx` in previous projects, but I feel I want a higher abstraction cause the project as I mentioned is full of CRUD operations.

I found another (looks relatively new) library called `rel` here [https://github.com/Fs02/rel](https://github.com/Fs02/rel)

I looked at the documentation here [https://fs02.github.io/rel/#/basics?id=full-example](https://fs02.github.io/rel/#/basics?id=full-example) and find it look really good, as I feel like this one has a good thing that is not in gorm which is being **non-invasive**.

However, I feel like I am going to bet on it since there are no many stars on GitHub (currently around 200). 

This is why I cam and ask here, Does anybody have experience with it?

I'm learning in Golang. I've finished A Tour of Go and effective go.I think effective go is not enough information after graduate A Tour of Go. (It's felt like difficult for me)Do you know nice learning article that level is between A Tour of Go and effective go?I hope to learn comprehensive things.(I'm a web developer. I hope to use Golang for this area)Thanks in advance.

hi

I'm looking for a CLI parsing package to parse arguments with the following specific feature:

* allow multiple arguments and then multiple options on each argument:
   * `myapp foo` - process foo
   * `myapp -n 5 foo` - process foo 5 times
   * `myapp -p 3 foo` - process foo with 3 cores max
   * `myapp foo bar` - process foo and bar
   * `myapp -n 5 foo -n 4 bar` - process foo 5 times and bar 4 times
   * `myapp -n 5 foo -n 4 -p 2 bar` - process foo 5 times and bar 4 times using 2 cores max so basically: `myapp [arg] ... [arg] with arg = [-n int] [-p int] string` with -n defaulting to 1 and -p to -1 (or whatever value I set).

I've quickly looked at cobra ([https://github.com/spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)) and ffcli ( [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/peterbourgon/ff/v3@v3.0.0?tab=doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/peterbourgon/ff/v3@v3.0.0?tab=doc) ) not sure they can do that. But before investing more times into them to see if they can I'd rather ask here if someone knows (or knows of another package that can do it).

Thx
