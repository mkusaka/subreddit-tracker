&amp;#x200B;

I am building a Gatsby site for a client that wanted a good CMS and "needed" a fast site (he had an issue with a Wix site before and is now obsessed with speed).

During a meeting he pulls up the [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) based on LightHouse and checks the site. The score was 35 for mobile and 83 for desktop.

I thought there was something wrong with the site and started checking how other web apps were doing. It turned out that even major light-weight sites like "Facebook for Developers" struggled to score close to 30/40 in the mobile version.

So now my question is: what's wrong with the mobile score that [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) gives?

btw you can check the site I am developing [here](https://thirsty-bell-786d5b.netlify.app/). It's still not pretty but speed wise I don't see visible issues.

How can I approach the subject with the client?
## [11][Removing selected items (rows) from a table](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j7b4e2/removing_selected_items_rows_from_a_table/)

In my app a user can select items on a table using checkboxes, and submit those items to an API. I need to "refresh" the table so that the submitted items will not be shown again. Basically, I need to "subtract" \[...selectedItems\] from \[...items\]. How can I do that?

Hello, 

I start working at a music streaming startup next week as a front-end developer, we're planning to use react and I was wondering if anybody that has experience with audio apps could help suggest some libraries and resources that could come in handy. I will surely tackle some challenges along the way and if someone experinced wants to be around so I can ask them questions every now and then, I'd really appreciate that too.
