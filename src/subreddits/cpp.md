**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

The x86 has strong memory model. But what about ARM?

With the Apple switch, I am wondering if code that uses C++ std::atomics, and that runs bug-free with Intel CPUs,
could in fact reveal bugs when compiled for ARM (in case ARM has a weaker memory model).
I am not speaking about compiler bugs of course, but about wrong use of std::atomics that are "hidden" when used on Intel CPUs.

A programmer got up one day and thought to himself "I'm going to create something so bad, it will piss off everyone that has to touch it". This project was a cruel inside joke of a group of friends that hung around on IRC. They figured that if you create something over-engineered, badly designed, and uses pretty colors at the stdout, people will use it. You can even get funded by some government entity if you present your project with a nice powerpoint presentation.

Fast-forward 20 years, and we're stuck with CMake. The joke became reality, and countless hours of high salary office workers have been wasted attempting to debug arcane messages, behavior, and a DSL that was designed in the darkest corners of hell.

Now don't tell me CMake was not a joke. It is simply not possible for someone, or a group of people, to create such an abomination. They would have set fire to every physical copy of CMake known to mankind early in it's development after realizing it's horrible nature. Myth has it that if you use CMake, you must find another person within a week and get them to integrate CMake else you die in highly suspicious circumstances. Did you know that CMake is causing global warming due to the countless CPU cycles wasted trying to compile from source? Oh, the pure insanity that is the documentation. You want to compile a program? Take my advice, type those `g++` and `ld` commands by hand - doesn't matter how big your project is. Anything that avoids using CMake is a win in my book. 

Know that some people, somewhere, are having the time of their lifes, rolling around in stacks of money earned through billed CMake consultancy hours, books, and conference talks.

Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

The other day I stumbled upon this website:  [https://www.tomdalling.com/toms-data-onion/](https://www.tomdalling.com/toms-data-onion/)

This website has a payload encoded in base85 with some challenges inside.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was curious about testing a Modern C++ workflow (not in the sense of only-language Modern C++ but in the sense of add dependencies + build system + code completion + C++ itself, from a point of view of productivity) , I took the challenge and I implemented the base85 decoder that could decode the first layer of the challenge. This is a base85 decoder.

I wrote an article with the experience I had compared to when I started to code in 2002, where code completion was a fantasy, refactoring was inexistent and the build tools and dependency management were either autotools or platform-specific things or do-your-own stuff.

I named the resulting project onionbase85 as a tribute to Tom's Data Onion challenge and I published it in Github.

At the end of the article you can find the link to the Github repo, but if you want to skip the article altogether, just go here: [https://github.com/germandiagogomez/onionbase85](https://github.com/germandiagogomez/onionbase85)

Warsim is a modern text based game that has now sold over 20,000 copies. Huw Millward started the project by just trying to learn the basics of C++ by creating I/O console applications. If you a re struggling with C++ as I did, this might be the motivation necessary!

This is a sort-wrapper which enables the use of std::sort (or other random-access sort techniques) with non-random-access containers. And it also speeds up sorting of large types in random-access containers.  
 

It is, on average across all numbers of sorted elements:

&amp;#x200B;

* \+130% faster than std::sort when used on vectors or arrays of large structs (\~480 bytes)
* \+28% faster than std::list's internal sort, on types smaller than a large struct.

std::list's internal sort is faster for large structs (as it only  writes previous and next pointers) and std::sort is faster on vectors  and arrays for smaller types.

More info at the link above, but basically it works by obtaining pointers to elements, then sorting them via the values of the elements they point to. Hence it has a temporary memory cost.
