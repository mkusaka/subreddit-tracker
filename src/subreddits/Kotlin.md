Anyone happen to have an example repo using 
- Gradle + Kotlin DSL (specifically `gradle.build.kts`)
- Javalin
- Docker

... that produces a runnable docker image?

I'm new to the JVM ecosystem (coming from Node/Rust), and this has been surprisingly difficult to get working on my own.

Thanks!

After a number of years of on again and off again study I am finally finishing a Java course.  I read an article that said once you've worked through Java it was best to jump to Kotlin before picking up any bad habits.  I need to make a couple websites so my plan was to start learning Spring Boot.  But then I wondered if it was best to start off with Kotlin and then jump into Spring Boot?

Hi guys, hope y'all doing well.

I'm trying to integrate Stripe's Payment API into my backend project but I'm facing a difficulty in terms of which layer it should go in. So far I've realized it should be in the repository (correct me if I'm wrong) cause it's related on how data is stored and managed and the job of the repository is to hide how data is handled. Now the questions are:

1. Should the repository depend on abstractions rather than direct access to ORM and 3rd APIs such as Stripe? 

2. If so, should these abstractions use Domain or Data model to communicate with the repository?

3. What's the best way to handle atomic operations when using multiple data sources in this case(the database and the API since one depends on each other) ?

For the last point, the best way I found to do it is to use runCatching for each call to database or the API and use onFailure for rollback. Is there a better way to day do it? 

I searched a lot but couldn't find an answer for any of these questions, I would appreciate if anyone could guide me on how to implement it properly. Thanks

### New Kotlin Community Discord Server

Hey there Kotlin Developers, recently I and my friends thought it would be nice to forge a little Kotlin Community Server for people to talk with each other since some people are more active on discord compared to Slack. If you would like to join just use [https://inv.wtf/kt](https://inv.wtf/kt) and it should redirect you to an instant invite! Have a lovely day guys!  

This is **NOT** an official server.

Thanks

I recently started learning programming, I was learning Python. But I am more and more attracted by Android and I would like to connect my future with it. 

Do I need to learn Java before learning Kotlin for Android development nowadays?
