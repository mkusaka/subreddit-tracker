## [2][TypeORM Sucks!! Something I wanted to talk about since long!](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jcw28f/typeorm_sucks_something_i_wanted_to_talk_about/)

Let's address it, TypeORM sucks but the community doesn't seem to do anything about it!! So I would like to take the step forward:

1. Querybuilder is very bad, chaotic

2. Relational query is not supported - subquery on relation etc

3. Eager loading is not supported

4. Cannot extend query builder

5. Repository is just sugar coating over bad querybuilder

6. Migration is super ugly and bad, have to write raw alter table queries 50% of the times, don't run migrations in batch

7. Seeders are not supported

8. Documentation asks to enable the db-model syncronization in development, but says to create migrations for production - What the hell?

9. Entity Manager is of no use

10. Polymorphic relations not supported

11. ORM cannot spot basic difference between where() and andWhere()

&amp;#x200B;

Thesre are my two cents! Your feedbacks are most welcome! 

We need better alternative ORM in typescript!

Hey! I've just started using graphQL and would advice on whats the best framework setup for Typescript on Frontend (Vue 3) + Backend (Node).

I'm currently using **AWS Amplify** to create the graphQL API and love how it generates the mutations / queries and subscriptions automatically just from a basic schema like:

&gt;type Todo u/model {id: ID!name: String!description: String}

Although it seems lacking in types and I'd ideally like to not get locked into the AWS ecosystem.

I've looked into Vue Apollo but couldn't figure out how to automatically mutations / queries and subscriptions and ideally would like to have this feature on frontend and backend.

I'd rather not have to manually set up all the the mutations / queries and if needed I could then customise them further down the line once I'm more familiar with graphQL. I'd love a solution where I can define schema and then just have default methods for each one that can be accessed like this.

`await graphQL.createTodo( {name: 'Demo todo'})`

`await graphQL.subscribeTodo( {id: '123'})`

Anyway would love to hear opinions on what frameworks are best, so I can get all that juicy goodness from having a predefined schema.

EDIT: To clarify I'll  be using a hosted graphQL instance and Node backend will also be a client.

It is open source so you can edit it and make it your own. [https://github.com/ably/ouija](https://github.com/ably/ouija) I've also written up a very thorough readme which goes over how it all works which is in the repo.

    type ConfigCallback = (...args: never[]) =&gt; AxiosRequestConfig
    
    class ApiService {
      private ctx: Context
      constructor(ctx: Context) {
        this.ctx = ctx
      }
    
      buildRequest&lt;T&gt;(config: ConfigCallback) {
        return async (...ar: Parameters&lt;typeof config&gt;): Promise&lt;T&gt; =&gt; {
          const resolvedConfig =
            typeof config === 'function' ? config.apply(this, ar) : config
          try {
            return await this.ctx.$axios.$request&lt;T&gt;(resolvedConfig)
          } catch (e) {
            throw e
          }
        }
      }
    
      commons: this.buildRequest&lt;Commons[]&gt;((type: string) =&gt; ({
        url: versioned('commons'),
        method: 'get',
        params: { type },
      }))
    
      someMethod(){
        // Argument of type '"string"' is not assignable to type 'never'
        this.commons('someType')
      }
    
    }

Some might say I should do (type: string) =&gt; this.buildRequest&lt;&gt;() and remove all the trickery in buildRequest(), however "commons" or something similar doesn't have to be a function, so I want to avoid calling it like this.commons('params')().
## [8][swc with Jest vs swc with Babel](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jcdie9/swc_with_jest_vs_swc_with_babel/)

So I've recently been seeing some impressive claims about various pieces of JS tooling written in languages other than JavaScript, so I was keen to give some of them a try.

Today I spent some of my work 10% time experimenting with swapping babel out of the toolchain of a current work project (a small typescript react application that was originally bootstrapped with Create React App) and replacing it with SWC.

Although test times are at present not that bad, anticipating the project getting bigger, I was particularly interested in seeing whether I could improve the test times (also jest runs are easy to benchmark).

The result was a little bit disappointing. Using `yarn add jest-benchmark` I found that our tests ran at an average of about 6.75 seconds per run using `babel` (average over 10 runs), compared to 6.5 using `swc`. Now I appreciate that transpilation isn't the only bottleneck in a test run, but given the wild claims I've seen everywhere about these tools (and all the blog posts which talk about it significantly speeding up your test runs), is this really what I'd expect to see or have I misconfigured things somehow? I've already raised an issue on the `swc` Github repository already only to have my issue immediately closed with a spectacularly unhelpful reply ([https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1172](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1172)).

To configure `swc` with `jest`, I installed `jest-swc` and changed the `jestConfig` transform block to the following:

    "transform": {
      "^.+\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$": "swc-jest",
      "^.+\\.css$": "&lt;rootDir&gt;/config/jest/cssTransform.js",
      "^(?!.*\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx|css|json)$)": "&lt;rootDir&gt;/config/jest/fileTransform.js"
    },

I then added the following `.swcrc` to the root of the repository:

    {
      "jsc": {
        "target": "es2017",
        "parser": {
          "syntax": "typescript",
          "tsx": true,
          "decorators": false,
          "dynamicImport": false
        },
        "transform": {
          "react": {
            "pragma": "React.createElement",
            "pragmaFrag": "React.Fragment",
            "throwIfNamespace": true,
            "development": false,
            "useBuiltins": false
          },
          "hidden": {
            "jest": true
          }
        }
      },
      "module": {
        "type": "commonjs",
        "strict": false,
        "strictMode": true,
        "lazy": false,
        "noInterop": false
      }
    }

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jcct5w/updating_relationship_objects_using_typeorm/

I have two entities:

    @Entity({ name: 'problem' })
    export class Problem {
      @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
      id: string;
       
      @Column({ type: 'boolean', default: false })
      isSolved: boolean;
    
      @ManyToOne(() =&gt; Student, student =&gt; student.problems,  { nullable: true })
      student: Student;
    }
    
    @Entity({ name: 'student' })
    export class Student {
      @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
      id: string;
    
      @OneToMany(() =&gt; Problem, problem =&gt; problem.student, { cascade: ['insert', 'update'], nullable: true }) 
      problems: Problem[];
    }

Each student and problem can exist independently; when creating a new problem, I want to update the student relationship 'problems':

 

    const students :Â Student[]Â =Â await getConnection().
 getRepository(Student).find({Â relations:Â ['problems']Â });
    
        students.forEach(async function (student, index) {
          // Student is free can solve problems
          if (student.problems === undefined || student.problems.length == 0) {        
            newProblem.student = student;
            // RELATIONSHIP NOT UPDATED TO STUDENT EVEN IF A PROBLEM WAS ASSIGNED
            await getConnection().getRepository(Problem).save(newProblem).then(e =&gt; ProblemDTO.fromEntity(e));
            return newProblem;
          }

How can I update both sides (student + problem)?

## [11][What is the proper way to extend custom headers on a fetch request?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jbxqh1/what_is_the_proper_way_to_extend_custom_headers/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jbxqh1/what_is_the_proper_way_to_extend_custom_headers/
---
I was getting "No overload matches this call" until I used `new Header()` to sneak my custom headers in via object.

Another option would be to use a global declaration file to extend the fetch global variable.

Should one turn to declaration files for custom headers in this case?
