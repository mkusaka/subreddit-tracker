## [4][Is anyone else frustrated by the state of React documentation, before and after the introduction of hooks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ge8fkg/is_anyone_else_frustrated_by_the_state_of_react/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ge8fkg/is_anyone_else_frustrated_by_the_state_of_react/

I frequently read tutorials, articles about React, etc., and I feel like the introduction of hooks made a barely functional situation totally dysfunctional.

To people who may have learned React before this split happened - in which case, you wouldn't have noticed - here's a summary.

Once upon a time, React was released. A bunch of tutorials and explanations about it were written, often centered on classes. They rose to the top of the Google search results.

Then hooks debuted. It was recommended that, if you could write your component using only hooks, you should. If you're starting a green field project - which includes every beginner - hooks first, classes second! People wrote some articles that put hooks first, that basically respected this philosophy.

But... the search results never caught up.

Instead of replacing "Beginning with React: Learning Classes" with "React Starter Kit: Introducing Hooks", the search results stayed stale. It's like everything written with classes had an ironclad grip on all the beginning with React search results, which only a few tutorials about hooks were able to break loose.

So now the search results are an unholy mess of tutorials and articles written about classes before hooks existed, and a few with hooks, with hooks now looking like this newfangled optional later add-on, or "advanced material" instead of, you know, the easier-to-understand less-boilerplate default.

All the time now, I feel like I see beginners saying on Twitter, "I'm about to learn React - starting this tutorial about classes! Wish me luck..." and then, only much later - possibly never - saying something like, "Hmm, decided to tackle hooks, finally feeling ready for this."

Instead of being a simplifier, it feels like (in the perception of many people) hooks are actually a complicator, becoming 'one more difficult thing to learn' instead of 'an easier more intuitive path to learning.'

The message that hooks are an easier way to do all of this, and you can bypass classes entirely, that in fact you should start learning hooks and not the other way around - totally lost.

Not at all clear from the search results, either. I just checked the top 10 returned in my browser, and I got this representative example:

\&gt; To get started you should at least know the following features:&gt; 1. Let&gt; 2. Const&gt; 3. Arrow functions&gt; 4. Imports and Exports&gt; 5. Classes

Finally, I know you could say: Why does this matter? Shouldn't you learn both?

Well, one problem is, if you're trying to learn something that straddles React classes and hooks - say, Typescript - good luck!

Instead of just seeing tutorials that begin with hooks and continue from there, it's another clusterjunk of class based tutorials, with some code using hooks randomly sprinkled in. It's a mess!

That content I'm searching for may exist, but it's damn hard to find through search engines, which seem to have failed dismally to updating to hooks-using content.

And beginners have no idea that hooks are supposed to make life easier for them, rather than being 'advanced' or 'Google interview question' React.

Hooks make learning and writing React easier, but you'd never know that from the average search result being returned online.

Hi! I am new to React and I‚Äôve discovered that there are quite a few options when choosing a UI Framework. One of the options that popped out to me was Bootstrap for React, as I‚Äôve used Bootstrap in many of my simple html/css/js projects. 

I have two questions regarding UI Frameworks:

How popular are UI frameworks in real-world React Development? 

What is your preferred framework and why?

I‚Äôm sure this has some obvious answer that I‚Äôm missing but I can‚Äôt find anything solid online. 

Are there any performance differences between importing component with react vs using React.Component when creating your class?

I have an working component where I can add and upload images to a backend. I recently noticed that I also need to be able to resize the images and found a great looking component called [react-image-crop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-crop).

I tried the [example](https://codesandbox.io/s/beautiful-wildflower-kobkt) and it works perfectly. But when I try to insert the example-code in my own component it does not work. I was expecting the image and imagePreview to show after selecting a single image. But I only get the original image rendered

 I copy/pasted the whole example changing only the `onSelectFile` to `fileHandler.`

In the useStates `imgRef` I get "&lt;img /&gt;" and in `previewUrl` I get "undefined"

What am I doing wrong ?
