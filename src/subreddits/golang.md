***Background***: I'm a student, I'm profound in Java, know the basics of Go and know the basics of JS. I'm tasked with creating a specific web app over the span of several months. 

***Initial thoughts***:

\- Go for backend (as apposed to PHP)

\- Angular or something alike for frontend

***My take***: 

As I would have to learn almost everything from scrath with fairly limited time, I thought of signing up for a Udemy course, such as this one: [https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language/](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language/). However, I would still need to learn how to use Angular.

**What would you say is the best/easiest way to learn fullstack web development using Go (and maybe Angular)?** Will the Udemy course teach me everything I need to know, in order to develope a web application, including database integration, users login, etc.?

Website and golang client lib looks really good so it's probably a good thing.

As I understand, if some unexpected (expected actually if I am ready to send it to the sentry) situation happens, I need to put all the context to the event and send it to the sentry. I also should do the same for logs and traces, or they are mutually exclusive?

Do I need to use `sentry.Capture*` in all `if err != nil {` or in one such `if` on top level function call, like: `err := handleSomeRequest(args); if err != nil { sentry.CaptureException(err) }` ?
