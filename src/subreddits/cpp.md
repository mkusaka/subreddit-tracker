Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Where is it's place in game engines? I understand that there are engines that use C++ but those are mainly for AAA productions (Such as the Unreal Engine.) but is it anywhere in small engines?

So in cmath the cos function is giving me wired results for example cos of 1.570 radians (so around 90 degrees) is -1.03412e-13 even do from my knowlege it should be around 0.

I know c++ does some optimizations and doesnt give perfet results but -1.03412e-13 isn't even close to 0. I tried diffrent online cos calculators and they gave the correct results. Why is that happening?

I had heard that some people really care about debug performance and out of pure curiosity I've recently been investigating code that is generated at -O0 and -Og and found the generated assembly to be shockingly bad.
I have a few simple questions based on that observation:

- Does it actually matter to you?
- Has this been a problem in your code base?
- What workarounds do you use?
- What is your optimization level in debug mode?

Edit: If you use -O0, have you tried -Og? If so, why do you prefer -O0?

I'm new to C++, but one of things I've heard being talked about most is the new feature called modules in C++, which apparently are able to reduce compilation times and clean up code.

However, they're also a lot of posts about why C++ modules are actually bad, such as

https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2019/01/27/modules-doa.html
https://izzys.casa/2017/10/millennials-are-killing-the-modules-ts/

and a few other reddit posts. However, I can't really understand what all these posts are saying, so can somebody summarize all the perceived problems with modules here please?
