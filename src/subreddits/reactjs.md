Hi, recently I started to learn python and I really enjoy that. I have an idea how to simplify my job, but to do that i need frontend application. My friend told me to give up at flask and django and learn react js. The problem is that i never learned basic javascrip and I dont know how to start. I found this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on udemy, can I start with this? I will appreciate every hint. Thanks.

Hello everyone!

React   newbie here. I'm seeking your help because I am currently struggling   with a feature. I managed to display a list of markers from an external   file (list of 3 museums in London) and added popups to them. But now  I'd  like to filter them with 3 buttons: let's say button1 displays  marker  1, etc.

I have no clue on  how to  perform such thing: my first thought would be to add some  specific  characteristic to each of them in my Data.js  
file but then I  do not know how to retrieve this info and based my  buttons on this  filter in my main component, could you please tell me  how to do it? Any  hints?

Here is what I've done so far:

&amp;#x200B;

 

    // Main document
    import React, {PureComponent} from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import ReactMapGL, {Marker, Popup} from "react-map-gl";
    import "./index.css";
    import Data from "./Data.js";
    
    
    const MAPBOX_TOKEN = "Mapbox_token";
    
    
    class Mapp extends PureComponent {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                viewport: {
                    latitude: 51.50985,
                    longitude: -0.11892,
                    zoom: 12,
                },
                markers: Data,
                selectedMarker: null
            };
        }
    
        _renderMarkers() {
            return (
                this.state.markers.map(marker =&gt; (
                    &lt;Marker
                        key={marker.id}
                        longitude={marker.longitude}
                        latitude={marker.latitude}&gt;
                            &lt;button 
                                className="marker-btn"
                                onClick={event =&gt; {
                                    event.preventDefault();
                                    this.setState({selectedMarker: marker})
                                }}&gt;
                                &lt;img 
                                    className="marker-btn"
                                    src="location-icon.svg"
                                    alt="location Icon"
                                /&gt;
                            &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/Marker&gt;
                ))
            )
        }
    
        _renderPopup() {
            return(
                this.state.selectedMarker &amp;&amp; (
                    &lt;Popup
                        longitude={this.state.selectedMarker.longitude}
                        latitude={this.state.selectedMarker.latitude}
                        onClose={() =&gt; {this.setState({selectedMarker: null})}}
                        offsetLeft={22.5}
                    &gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;

                            &gt;
    
                                {this._renderMarkers()}
                                {this._renderPopup()}
    
                        &lt;/ReactMapGL&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

    document.body.style.margin = 0;
    ReactDOM.render(
        &lt;Mapp /&gt;, 
        document.getElementById("root")
    )

 The file containing the information about my markers: 

 

    //Data.js
    const Data = [
      {

Hello all!  


I have made my initial deployment in Kubernetes and I was wondering if someone has done the same. I ask because I am wondering what type of livenessProbe/readinessProbe I can place for the NGINX pod serving the static files.  


Thank you in advance and regards.

Here's a simple contact manager app I made with React. The problem is that it only stores one record at a time so when I create a new record, the old one disappears. Does anyone know why? Here's the link:
