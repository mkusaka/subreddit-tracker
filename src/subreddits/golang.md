Hey everyone!

I have a bit of a strange request. At the moment my boyfriend (a programmer who loves Go) is having a pretty shit time generally. As sometime with literally no knowledge of programming or anything specific in this area I'm kind of lost as to how I can help specifically.

Basically looking to make him something to help him feel better and because he 'hates' puns I figure this is a good place to start! Are there any Go language/command(?) Puns that are pretty funny and simple? The current plan is an embroidery project on the pocket area of one of his shirts. (He donated it for a previous project willingly that never happened lol) 

I'm looking for top tier jokes, the really good ones, the ones you'd be willing to wear on a shirt!! Thank you for your help in advance!

Guys, I just want you to have a look at my open source distrubuted file system project on github. Iâ€™ll be pleased to have your comments about the readme files, code readability, understandability of the content and the like. Any input will be very helpful for me to create the project roadmap ðŸ¤—

In the latest days, I've been working on a small library which is able to determine current module root path, since I wasn't able to find a standard way (using a os method or system variable).

Is recursively looking for a go.mod file a good idea?

Any feedback is welcome!
## [9][Concurrency problem when writing to stdout and stderr with a multiplexed writer](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/ep02yz/concurrency_problem_when_writing_to_stdout_and/)

Hey /r/golang community,

at the moment I face a problem where I want to write the output of \`exec.Cmd\` commands to multiple writers. For this problem I created a struct, \`MultiplexedWriter\`, which holds all writers where it writes to.

You can view a working example on my gist.github account:  
[https://gist.github.com/SimonBaeumer/504e6c7f5747154872c88eb5eb827a48](https://gist.github.com/SimonBaeumer/504e6c7f5747154872c88eb5eb827a48)

I asked this question on StackOverflow and would appreciate every help or hint!

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59747920/writing-stderr-and-stdout-streams-to-multiple-writers-creates-inconsistent-resul](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59747920/writing-stderr-and-stdout-streams-to-multiple-writers-creates-inconsistent-resul)

My assumption is that the problem is in the implementation of the \`exec\` package itself but I am not quiet sure...

Thanks in advance!
## [10][Generating deltas (diffs/patches) for binary files to save storage space between file versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/ep02xo/generating_deltas_diffspatches_for_binary_files/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/ep02xo/generating_deltas_diffspatches_for_binary_files/
---
I am wanting to create deltas of binary files using Go. I have done a reasonable amount of research into my options (that don't include me writing the algorithm from scratch). Perhaps this is a useful reference, but hopefully someone/people can help me succeed here. I will outline the options I have discovered, and my experiences.
In terms of a scenario I am testing/researching for:
* There are two versions of a file
* You have both versions, however your colleague only has the original version
* Instead of sending the whole new version, you can send the delta of the new version and they can patch it on to the original

I am interested in an algorithm for images, binary files such as word docs, powerpoints, photoshop files, video files etc as opposed to text files or executables.

0. Bsdiff.
I started out with bsdiff however it has been optimised for binary file diffing and that results in it indexing the bytes for faster analysis, however causes it to be very memory intensive. I tried storing this index to disk but in some cases its 10x the size of the original files.
My goal is an algorithm that can diff a binary and save significant space (obviously dependent on the amount of file that has differs).

For reference, my testing jpg is a 12MB image, and the second image is the same 12MB image with a blue square in the middle thats about 25% of the size of the whole image (in space, rather than bytes).
1. github.com/monmohan/xferspdy

```
	fingerprint := xferspdy.NewFingerprint("testdata/profile-shot.jpg", 1024)
	diff := xferspdy.NewDiff("testdata/profile-shot-to.jpg", *fingerprint)
	modifiedFile, _ := os.OpenFile("testdata/profile-shot-to-applied.jpg", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0777)
	xferspdy.PatchFile(diff, "testdata/profile-shot.jpg", modifiedFile)
```
* On provided (testdata) from the repository this seems to work. However I get stack overflow whenever I use my own data and it seems related to file size* 

2. github.com/mdvan/fdelta

```
  delta := fdelta.Create(originalBytes, newBytes)
	appliedBytes, err := fdelta.Apply(originalBytes, deltaBytes)
```

* Works but the diff on testdata such as images is almost exactly the same size as the file that is being diff'd in the first place. THe diff is not smaller in anyway

3. github.com/balacode/go-delta

```
	var d = delta.Make(sourceData, targetData)
	d, _ := delta.Load(patchData)
	var appliedData, err = d.Apply(sourceData)
```
* Same issue as 2. The delta is no smaller

4. github.com/jbreiding/rsync-go

```
  rs.CreateSignature(originalFileReader, writeSignature)
	err := rs.CreateDelta(newFileReader, sig, writeOperation)
	rs.ApplyDelta(newFileWriter, originalFileReader, opsOut)
```

* It actually creates a patch that is larger than the original files, however I suspect it can be compressed effectively as the byte data _seems_ like it fits in the ASCii space. I may try.

6. github.com/snej/zdelta-go

```
  delta, err := zdelta.CreateDelta(originalBytes, newBytes)
	appliedBytes, err := zdelta.ApplyDelta(originalBytes, deltaBytes)
```

* Crashes as the library no longer adheres to the rules around pointers to pointers when using the C binding

7. github.com/konsorten/go-xdelta

```
	options := xdelta.EncoderOptions{
		FileID:    "TestFullRoundtrip",
		FromFile:  fromFile,
		ToFile:    toFile,
		PatchFile: patchFile,
	}

	enc, err := xdelta.NewEncoder(options)
	err = enc.Process(context.TODO())
```
* I had high hopes for this one, however the patch is again similar in size to the original files

Can anyone point me in the direction of any more that may fulfil my needs?
Thanks!
