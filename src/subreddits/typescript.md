I swear I something in io-ts that allows you to check whether an arbitrary object matches a io-ts type without the entire isLeft/isRight ceremony. Just a simple boolean value. Does anyone remember what this method in the library is?

Very new to typescript. Been scratching my head on how to do in the right way for sometime now.

# Context

Im using hapijs, and was trying to setup the routes. The `server.route` method takes in a array of route configuration objects `&lt;ServerRoute[]&gt;`. In each of the `ServerRoute`, there is a property called `method` which has the following type

    /**
     * (required) the HTTP method. Typically one of 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', or 'OPTIONS'. Any HTTP method is allowed, except for 'HEAD'. Use '*' to match against any HTTP method.
     */
    method: Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL | Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL[] | string | string[];

where the `Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL` is:

    type HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL =
    'GET'
    | 'POST'
    | 'PUT'
    | 'PATCH'
    | 'DELETE'
    | 'OPTIONS'
    | HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL_LOWERCASE;

# What I have tried

This is how i create the routes:-

    server.route(&lt;ServerRoute[]&gt;[
        {
            "method": "GETzz", // here "GETzz" is not a valid UTIL.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL
            "path": "/",
            "handler": rootHandler().get,
        }
    ]);

I tried asserting by `"method": &lt;Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL&gt;"GETzz";`, which gives me auto-completions for that type inside quotes, but the value is still not checked to be part of `UTIL.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL` or not.

(Edit)But take this example:-

    type Methods = "valid1" | "valid2";
    const obj:{method:Methods} = {
            method: "inValidValue",
    }

The above would result in the error that i was hoping for, which's `Type '"inValidValue"' is not assignable to type 'Methods'.`

# Question

The question is how to enforce the property `method` to only be assigned values that exists in type `UTIL.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL`? Currently i can give any value like `GETzz` etc but still no error is thrown, until I run the server and a request is made to the corresponding `path`. The information from that error is unreadable and in no way helps in pointing out that, giving the value of `method` as `GETzz` is why the server failed. 

(Edit)Is it a problem with the type definition files of hapijs in DefinitelyTyped?

So when I compile a `.ts` file to a `.js` file and then run the `.js` file and get errors at line `x` column `y` I can not look at my `.ts` file at line `x` column `y` because the `.js` code has code at different places than the corresponding code in the `.ts` file . Is there any way to fix that?
## [7][linting types](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/glcpew/linting_types/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/glcpew/linting_types/

How to solve that (I am using vscode):

1. eslint shows that I do not use **imported** types , despite the fact that I  use them.
2. eslint does shows error for types that I have **defined** but do not use, but when I hover over the unused type I see a ts error `"type" is declared but never used.ts(6196)`. However there is no red highlighting . Just the color of syntax highlighter is deem and is difficult to spot .

What I have done so far :

    npm install --save-dev eslint typescript
    npx eslint --init

I have choosen that I use typescript and esmodules and installed the extra packages suggested by eslint.

This might be a simple question but I search everywhere and couldn't find the answer.

`export interface IRouterMatcher&lt;T, Method extends 'all' | 'get' | 'post' | 'put' | 'delete' | 'patch' | 'options' | 'head' = any&gt; {`  
 `// tslint:disable-next-line no-unnecessary-generics (This generic is meant to be passed explicitly.)`  
`&lt;P extends Params = ParamsDictionary, ResBody = any, ReqBody = any, ReqQuery = Query&gt;(path: PathParams, ...handlers: Array&lt;RequestHandler&lt;P, ResBody, ReqBody, ReqQuery&gt;&gt;): T;`  
 `// tslint:disable-next-line no-unnecessary-generics (This generic is meant to be passed explicitly.)`  
`&lt;P extends Params = ParamsDictionary, ResBody = any, ReqBody = any, ReqQuery = Query&gt;(path: PathParams, ...handlers: Array&lt;RequestHandlerParams&lt;P, ResBody, ReqBody, ReqQuery&gt;&gt;): T;`  
`(path: PathParams, subApplication: Application): T;`  
`}`

 It seems like this is the interface for 'get, post put, delete...' but what does this line mean?

`Method extends 'all' | 'get' | 'post' | 'put' | 'delete' | 'patch' | 'options' | 'head' = any`

Is `method` also a generic in here? If it is then why it isn't used inside the interface? Also what is this whole thing 

`'all' | 'get' | 'post' | 'put' | 'delete' | 'patch' | 'options' | 'head'`

Are they also some kinds of interface?

One more question, how come express is written in typescript but I can require this module in pure JS ? Sorry for asking so many questions :(
## [11][I created a simple, dependency free web server with live reload for Deno called Denoliver (sorry..)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/gl3g5e/i_created_a_simple_dependency_free_web_server/)

Hey everyone,

I wanted to get into Deno and see what it had to offer during the weekend so I decided to write a small file server that:

* Is dependency free
* Has live reload
* Supports client routing

All written in Typescript of course :)

It was heavily inspired by Luke Jackssons [Servor](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor)

Would love if you wanted to try it out, or contribute!
