I'm a tottaly noob with js and regex, and I'm trying to create a function to scrape some data from a brazilian stocks website to insert in a spreadsheet. I was using xPath with the IMPORTXML function, but as my sheet was growing, the IMPORTXML function couldn't handle too many requests, and ended up not loading anything.

I'm using [this](https://statusinvest.com.br/) website to get the data from. Taking [this](https://statusinvest.com.br/acoes/abev3) stock as example.

My goals here are:

1. I want to take some of the indicators from [this](https://i.imgur.com/que6tXI.png) div area (such as P/L, LPA, M. LÍQUIDA, and others);
2. And some of the numbers from [this](https://i.imgur.com/lA8q7pC.png) tables's first column (such as row 11, 15, and others).

My sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PQV8exagIIbuME214F5Q6HU52Q01sFvo3AL-E2KKRxE/edit?usp=sharing).

What is the easiset way to achieve my goals? And as for I have 10 columns to get different things, should I have 10 different functions?

Since now, I thank you guys!

I'm not new to JavaScript, but have been exploring machine learning lately.

I can't find *any* examples of this, and as I'm new to machine learning, any guidance would be much appreciated :)

There are a number of reinforcement learning libraries out there, but they implement their own neuronal networks... Which aren't performant. Tensor flow uses webgl, which is 100x faster than the CPU in my testing.

There are also reinforcement algorithm only libs, but don't show how to integrate with a neural network. :/

Basically, I'm lost.

 thanks.  :)
