This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I'm trying to figure out the best monetization template so I'm asking.

1. Your total app profits? 
2. How many apps? 
3. Via Paid app, in-app, ads?
4. How many years took you to reach that?

Thanks!
## [6][Do Instant Apps through the web still work ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ixdftx/do_instant_apps_through_the_web_still_work/)

Hey I am working on a small instant app project for my company and cannot seem to see any websites that link to an instant app. For eg If I go to the play store page for vimeo, it shows up a "Try Now" button next to install, but searching on chrome, vimeo links take me to the website and not the instant app.

I also have the settings enabled for allowing to upgrade web links. Does this features still exist or are instant apps limited to the try now button on play store ?

I am publishing new application from new account and I need to make sure the app will be released in time. I submitted the app for a closed test and I still couldn't open the link for testers (I guess because of the review?).

After review finishes, will I be able to transfer this version to release immediately, or will it require another review from Google?

## [12][Changes to RemoteViews for Android 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iwx0bz/changes_to_remoteviews_for_android_11/)

Has there been any changes to RemoteView in Android 11. In my existing apps for displaying larger images on notification, which works fine on &lt;=Android 10 devices, earlier I was seeing an error printed that 'Removed too large RemoteViews'. But this has now been switched to a warning 'RemoteViews too large on this might be stripped in a future release'.  
Are any of these changes documented for Android 11.
