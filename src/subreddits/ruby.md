I’ve started to learn ruby roughly 6 years ago and am getting back at it. Doing Ruby on Rails projects while re-learning Ruby at the same time. I started to watch the [RubyConf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9R7PUCEXo) in the hope that I would get more info about the status of ruby, things that have been added, removed and about the compatibilities.

While I’m doing a project, I am getting confused again about the fact whether I have to call a function with or without parenthesis and it’s damn confusing. You’re forced to use a linter only because of this issue already. There’s a certain beautify to the syntax of the language, but the syntax is so flexible that I do think it’s actually removing readability and UX in some way.

The RubyConf 2019 mentioned about they want to introduce keyword arguments, which is hard to implement during the flexibility in the syntax Ruby is providing, the pattern matching is extremely slow lately and is recommended not to use, unless 3.0 released.

I haven’t used Ruby in production mode and certainly haven’t done *big* projects, but I’m not convinced Ruby is *the* language to go with, but at the same time, lately I’ve been applying for remote jobs and I came across so many applications looking for Ruby / Ruby on Rails developers that it became my motivation to continue with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

My questions are:
- Is it worth to continue to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails?
- How has Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails been doing the last years? Trouble to keep up with other languages? Or has is it improved significantly? 
- What’s your personal reason you continued to work in Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails?

It seems mistydemeo created a replica of the original website to help people reading the Poignant Guide practise on it. Here it is:  [https://github.com/mistydemeo/preeventualist](https://github.com/mistydemeo/preeventualist) 

How do I make use of this github alternative? I'm a total newb at Ruby &amp; programming in general.

Also, Chapter 6 from the guide, jfyr:  [https://poignant.guide/book/chapter-6.html](https://poignant.guide/book/chapter-6.html)
## [4][How do i create a recursive fibonacci function that prints until the argument?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/fn7ak5/how_do_i_create_a_recursive_fibonacci_function/)

So I have been struggling with this for quite some time. I can create a recursive fibonacci function that basically takes an argument and returns the fibonacci number at the position denoted by the argument. So \`fibs(3)\` would return 2. however now i wanna change it a little bit and print all the fibonacci numbers from the beginning uptill the position denoted by the argument. So this time, \`fibs(3)\` would return 1 , 1 , 2 unlike the previous return which was just 2. But i cant figure out how would i do that.

I'm on OpenSUSE and the available version of Ruby by default is 2.5. Is that acceptable for learning modern Ruby, or am I missing on on serious goodies in 2.6? I'm not interested in learning anything Rails related, if that makes any difference.

The company I was just laid off from uses Ruby in most applications, and if I want to move up and be of more use I need to get beyond the copy and paste of it all and start understanding how to write it and make it functional for myself.


I've gotten through TryRuby and I bought some books, but I'm a hands on learner who can see something done and then learn from that. Any resources you can recommend, or small projects I can start with?

Hey y'all total noob here but something just occurred to me and I fired up pry to play with no luck.

OK so I know you can write

`my_string = %w(The brown fox is lost)`

`=&gt; ["The", "brown", "fox", "is", "lost"]`

But is there a way to inject a variable into the %w(variable) without it thinking it's a string? i.e.

`my_string = "The brown fox is lost"`

`new_arr = %w(my_string)`

Hopefully get this?

`new_arr`

`=&gt; ["The", "brown", "fox", "is", "lost"]` 

And I know it's no biggie I can always call the split(' ') on the string, I was only curious, seems like a nice lil shorthand especially when getting user input, no?

Thanks in advance.
