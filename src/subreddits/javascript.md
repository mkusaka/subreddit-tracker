As part of my new year's resolutions I want to get a little less camera shy and I thought I have a somewhat interesting story to share about being the solopreneur owner of a web app. This opens up the possibility to show all the code/analytics etc. without repercussions from any other stake-holders.

In terms of priorities, I wanted to ask you all what topics would you like to see covered? Here are some initial ideas I had. Feel free to add anything you don't see here.

(FYI: The site is a two-sided marketplace selling Word documents )

**Coding Topic Ideas**

1. generating a maximally enjoyable development environment (e.g. seeding data, simulating cron, mirroring production as much as possible etc.)
2. removing brittleness from integration tests that run on circleci
3. dealing with the shitshow that is sales tax accounting across multiple currencies
4. detecting and recovering from production bugs asap
5. dealing with the real-world mess that is imperfect user input (e.g. when they type emails with a leading space or inconsistent capitalization; when they create a tag that is almost the same as a previous one — like E Guitar vs. Electric Guitar—and now your data is split across two areas)
6. discussing the 8+ year consequences of certain architectural/software design issues
7. streamlining massive amounts of config
8. multi-redundant systems of backup to prevent disaster
9. designing error messages and a logging strategy that speeds up recovery from errors
10. a tour of the most evil, insidious bugs I dealt with over the years (I keep a diary for them)
11. payment systems in-depth (refunds, errors etc.)
12. caching systems for performance
13. Javascript frameworks — why I decided to tear mine out and stick with simple, modular JS.
14. Choosing dependencies that don't come back and bite you in the ass (think about how the JSscape has changed in the last ten years...)

**Marketing/Business Topics Ideas**

1. how I use data to decide to add/remove a feature
2. AB testing a web app
3. technical SEO (microdata, site structure for internal links, google's tools, sitemaps, etc.) — I get 85% of my traffic (and therefore revenue) from SEO, so I know a thing or two
4. how I use JS and integration tests on all tracking code (critical to get right in my business)
5. auto-email systems to previous customers for extra sales
6. Adwords workflow to drive revenue
7. Analytics workflow to figure out what content working
8. Writing copy that gets sales (what worked for me vs. didn't)

## [11][[AskJS] why is css-in-js so popular when css modules is a thing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/f3cpdl/askjs_why_is_cssinjs_so_popular_when_css_modules/)

It seems to me that css-in-js takes some extra parsing which to my understanding happens @ initial load time, which we usually try to minimize. At some point when styling conflicts were resolved by discipline using namespacing like BEM avoiding conflicts was a hassle and imo unenjoyable busy work, but css modules solves that problem. 
Now I’m assuming that the large part of the web community that decided to use css-in-js aren’t idiots, but I don’t get it. Am I missing some major benefits?
