i published my first react project today - it's just a simple website, and i'm hosting it on firebase with a custom domain. i was wondering how other people host react websites. i know there's no right or wrong way to do it, but i wonder what the other ways to do it are.

Dear fellow react enthousiasts! I'm looking for advice for a specific problem I'm facing. I'm building an app that acts as a **container for user-supplied scientific experiments**. The platform takes care of most of the features (identifying people, configuration, etc.) and is under my control. But a part of the application should be flexible enough to make it possible for users to **"inject" their problem-specific bundle of code in the application** (think: screen layouts, specific code to handle each result, etc.).  


I have resorted to simple solutions such as creating a Function object with the injected code as a constructor argument (the lesser evil eval). But that only takes me so far. I want users to be able to describe screen layouts (in jsx?), and **bind their implementations to dependencies that are already loaded and available** in the application (think: React, lodash, etc.). Ideally the user would be able to load their "application bundle" into the framework **at runtime**, and the container merges the supplied code (according to a well documented structure and api) into the running container application.  


I'm perfectly ok with users describing their screens as **React components**. But I would like to avoid that users have to supply their own environment (and potentially breaking the application when two instances of the same library are loaded) and build a complete separate application.

Which combination of technologies would help me out here? Anybody any experience with this kind of requirement? Bonus points for a solution that works in a React Native and React Web environment.
## [10][How can I get the IP address of the server using React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/imdv45/how_can_i_get_the_ip_address_of_the_server_using/)

I have a server with a React app on it. I simply want to be able to set the server's local IP address (the same one as would be in the browser bar) in my React app and display it.

Everything I have tried just gives me the IP address of the client that is displaying the React app (localhost).

How do I get the server's address?

Hi ReactJS we are open source developers working on the latest iteration of Reactime - A time-travel debugging tool for React, Hooks, and now with support for Recoil.js! We are extremely excited to launch this product and we hope that it would help you as React Developers to develop awesome apps. Here is the our [Github](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacTime) &amp; Chrome Store [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reactime/cgibknllccemdnfhfpmjhffpjfeidjga?hl=en-US](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reactime/cgibknllccemdnfhfpmjhffpjfeidjga?hl=en-US)

 Note: that you don't need to download any packages as this is a Chrome Dev Tool and we extract state data from React Fiber tree.

Ask us anything about React, Recoil, developing a debugging tool, or working in Open Source.
