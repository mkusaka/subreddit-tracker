I’m building a new project and I want to use the best options possible from 2020.  It is important to me that this project scales and is performant.

I’m thinking it’s Next using Apollo to call GraphQL that has endpoints available from an express server that points to ElasticSearch queries.

The part I’m concerned I might be over complicating is from Apollo to Express I know I have to use ElasticSearch.  I also know that I’ll be making multiple endpoint calls from the frontend and think GraphQL would solve this problem.  I’m most worried about GraphQL instead of using just REST endpoints because it seems like GRaphQL still requires those REST endpoints for it to get the data from ElasticSearch.  Is this the way I should be using it?

Hi all!

I'm  preparing the folder structure of a React/Node web app and I decided I  want to structure the repository to have a folder for the server and a  folder for the client, both with their own package.json file. I have  some trouble figuring out how to best integrate Prettier, ESLint and  Typescript, especially regarding to integrating them with VSCode. Would  it be better to have global configuration for both of them in the root  folder? Or would it be better to have seperate configuration files for  the server and the client?

Right now I'm leaning towards configuring Prettier globally and configuring ESLint and Typescript per package. Any advise?
