Hello! We launched our first-ever [moderator applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j32odm/whos_hiring_and_rreactjs_moderator_applications/) 2 weeks ago (in consultation with /u/nextdoorNabors from the Core Team) and dozens of you applied!

I'm excited to introduce our 4 new mods (note that some are newer accounts created for more "professional use"):

- /u/CodeGeeek is a UI Architect from Bengaluru, India üáÆüá≥ with &gt;10yrs experience in frontend. We've enjoyed [her talks](https://youtu.be/2so479wrHNk)! She's interested in adding more FAQs, reference material, and news recaps to our content mix.
- /u/Lashuel is a Sr. Software Eng from Sanaa, Yemen üáæüá™ who has given some cool [React](https://hooks-kyan.ayox.now.sh/) [talks](https://prod-talk.ayox.now.sh/). He's keen on organizing monthly challenges/activities for folks to stretch their React skills together.
- /u/ZenosGarcia is a fullstack engineer from California, USA üêª who was a Deputy District Attorney(!) before changing careers to webdev. As a bootcamp grad (like me!) she's keen on helping beginners understand React, feel welcome and not be intimidated.
- /u/Nutlope is originally from Morocco üá≤üá¶ and is now in his final year in CS at Drexel. He has [run a large gaming community](https://www.quora.com/profile/Hassan-El-Mghari-1) on the side. He's interested in starting a mentorship program here on /r/Reactjs and running more AMAs from key figures in our community.

They'll join the current active mod roster of /u/acemarke, /u/dance2die, /u/timmonsjg, /u/Charles_Stover from today. Thank you to the rest who applied - we couldn't accept everyone but we might grow again in future. Your suggestions will be shared with the mod team. Those who are interested in being considered in future can still [fill out our form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoP-n06uTmPouq2EOTQ5TD9vFH_jp7glG9hh4rpEZV1EHzSg/viewform?usp=pp_url).

Moderating is 100% volunteer community service, and Reddit gives mods only very limited powers to shape the culture of this community. Ultimately the most important elements here - from quality content to quality discussion to inclusiveness - comes from you, our members. Thank you for making /r/reactjs what it is today - now let's make it better :)

## [6][Client redirect trough server: CORS error.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jfbudv/client_redirect_trough_server_cors_error/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jfbudv/client_redirect_trough_server_cors_error/
---
I try to redirect the user from my client trough my Express API to another page. The reason for this is once the user hits the POST 'auth/login' endpoint with success (and valid data) he/she will be redirected to the home page.

That gives me the following error:

&gt;Access to XMLHttpRequest at '[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)' (redirected from '[http://localhost:4000/auth/login](http://localhost:4000/auth/login)') from origin '[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume this has something to do with handling CORS on the frontend, since my Express API is already using the following middleware:

    app.use(
      cors({
        origin: "http://localhost:3000",
        methods: "GET,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
        credentials: true
      })
    );

The idea is to create a microservice with no Node nor Express knowledge. the main purpose is to give front-end guys a way to build apps and consume APIs without the trouble of creating a proxy.

The JS module is built and deployed in a cloud (Google functions as of today) and called with a generated wrapper.¬†

## [11][Socket io with async operations](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jf9skn/socket_io_with_async_operations/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jf9skn/socket_io_with_async_operations/

Hey guys, I want socket to wait for my Async operation to finish before emitting, but it's not executing the last two lines at all.

How should I approach this?

`socket.on('passengers',¬†async¬†(id)¬†=&gt;¬†{`

`Logger.info('Passengers',¬†id);`

`const bus = await¬†(await Bus.query().findById(id))`

`.$relatedQuery('passengers')`

`.select('id',¬†'username',¬†'phone',¬†'location');`

&amp;#x200B;

`Logger.info('passengersBack',¬†bus);`

`socket.emit('passengersback',¬†bus);`

`});`
