* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Some time ago I got really tired of Googling every time I wanted to add a new dependency to my project, so I decided to come up with a plugin for Android Studio that will do that for me.

This version finally supports **build.gradle.kts** (Kotlin Script) files! :)

[See the plugin in action](https://imgur.com/a/A01LGEj)

You can download it from the [official Jetbrains Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10102-ok-gradle-)

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/scana/ok-gradle)

I deeply appreciate all kind of feedback! If you encounter any kind of bugs/issues, please, let me know!

Disclaimer: this features is/was already kinda (only for regular build.gradle files, though) available in Android Studio, as mentioned by u/wkalicinski in other thread about this plugin. You can see how to do that here: https://imgur.com/6bxEhCe
Though, I am still working on Ok, Gradle! in order to add more features, e.g. automatic library suggestions based on their popularity.

Hello,

I am currently writing an library in C++. On Android I would like this library to use the Android keystore for storing and using cryptographic keys. How is it possible? Or is it a pain?

Thanks

I've spent the last few days googling and trying to figure out how to \*easily\* do authentication to write to a google sheet from my app.  I have the reading part working.  I have read a lot of tutorials, and they all seem to do it a little differently, so I'm trying to figure out what is the most basic, simple (even if less secure) way to do this.  It's just for a personal thing, so I'm not so worried about security, as it's more of a proof of concept at this point.

Could someone give me a shove in the right direction, and maybe answer some questions as I work through this?

I have a frame layout inside a relative layout and i need to move frame layout on the press of a button a bit to the left and top. I have tried setLeft() and setTop() method which necessarily stretches my view but it's still okay for my purpose. But problem is i can't get the original unstretched frame layout back. 
Doing setRight() and setBottom() with same parameters does not seem to do the thing. Any suggestions will be welcome.

How do you deal with libraries that require an actual activity in order to work? And how do you avoid leaks? 

Currently my solution is to use a 'fake' activity which uses a soft reference to a real activity, but that seems to cause way too much problems and actual crashes if the activity is nulled. Is there a better way of doing this?

Hello

I want to start google ads campaign.

Is there any way to track (example in gameanalytics) only users from this campaign?
