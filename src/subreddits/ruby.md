Anyone know some direction for online intermediate level learning?? 

Iâ€™ve done the intro books, built simple text based games, little tutorial programs ... how do I level up now?!
Just need some starting points for the next level. 
Thanks all.

## [6][looping conditionals if none of the conditions are met](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/i3os0o/looping_conditionals_if_none_of_the_conditions/)

I wanted to see if there is a way to go back to a specific line if none of the if, and elsif statement's conditions are met. for example

puts "what would you like to do"

answer = gets.chomp

if answer == "add"

  \#thing happens

elsif answer == "display"

\#thing happens

end

so i need them to type either add or display, but they dont. so how can i restate the question without using goto?  (Since goto is apparently evil according to expert programmers.)
