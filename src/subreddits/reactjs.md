We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

## [3][I built my new portfolio in GatsbyJS and it's amazing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gq8564/i_built_my_new_portfolio_in_gatsbyjs_and_its/)

I decided to make a new faster portfolio with a catchy design so I have been reading through the amazing Gatsby doc for some time. It's not my first time building something with Gatsby, but I wanted to skim through the docs before starting.

Gatsby helped me get about score 99 (for desktop) and 90 (for mobile) on Google PageSpeed Insights.

  
Check it here: [https://web-dev.works](https://web-dev.works)  


* The blog is integrated with Contentful API. 
* Google Analytics already works. 
* The website being styled in flexbox, made it easier to be styled for different devices' screens. 
* The contact form works with Netlify Forms (no back-end work needed)  


You can find the Github repo here:  [https://github.com/Lartwel/portfolio](https://github.com/Lartwel/portfolio)

Website performance can be even better doing the headers redirects.  


Doing some Gatsby config and fixing stuff such as gatsby way of routing pages with animation was kinda time-consuming more than normal react or css/js for the first time, but I loved it.

My previous personal website wasn't very mobile friendly and relied on a third party library. I decided to spend a bit of time rewriting my command prompt / terminal inspired website from scratch using React and TypeScript.

There's definitely room for improvement, but I'm pretty happy with the results so far and it was a fun project to work on.

## [10][Is Redux just React's way of using global variables?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gpzg3i/is_redux_just_reacts_way_of_using_global_variables/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gpzg3i/is_redux_just_reacts_way_of_using_global_variables/
---
Most programmers start by using globals all over their code. It's a very easy way to code as you don't need to worry about passing arguments to functions or scoping. Everything is just available at the top level if you need it. But as I'm sure you all know, this is heavily discouraged and causes problems as your code grows beyond a small demo.

React on it's own makes sense as each component holds it's own state, and arguments are passed as props or returned through callbacks. Totally get that. But Redux (or any other global state management) seems to throw out all of the warnings of using global variables. The convention for using Redux is to put the state of your entire app in one store which is accessible and modifiable from anywhere.

Could someone explain the difference between using globals in a standard webapp and Redux in React? Why is it accepted to use Redux as global state when a top level variable is a big no-no in every language I've ever used.

A new version of Spinners React has been successfully released. The secondaryColor property is now added for an easy and more convenient way of changing background color along with some bug fixes. Thanks for your valuable feedback on the previous version of the component.

The Spinner React component received 209 stars on GitHub and was downloaded 1k+ times within the last 3 months.

As always, we are happy to continue improving the component, and thank you for your support â€” it is very much appreciated!
