This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I've noticed that if you used Nova launcher, and you try out some launchers (such as Apex Launcher, Evie Launcher, ADW Launcher 2, and maybe others), they let you import various settings from Nova launcher, including the shortcuts to apps and even the widgets.

How do they do it? How come it doesn't exist for other launchers? Are there other launchers that you can switch from, knowing that another launcher could import the data from?

Is this a known API ?

I‚Äôve never done any MVVM thing before, and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the significance of using such a headache!

Room is currently working fine for me without too much complications, but I‚Äôm using GlobalScope launch to get access the database, which is highly discouraged as I read [here](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-global-scope/). 

I wanna do it in a better way and learn more about the subject (MVVM, lifecycles, LiveData, etc), can you provide some links that help with that?

I‚Äôm hoping that implementing these will result in a better code.

Thanks, appreciate the help!

Hello,

Trying to create secure MQTT connection to Mosquitto server.  I'm using CA.crt certificate to get secure connection with help of [sample application](https://github.com/eurbon/Paho-MQTT-Android-TCP-TLS-WSS-Example/blob/master/app/src/main/java/paho/android/mqtt_example/MainActivity.java). 

&amp;#x200B;

Mosquitto server reports with error:

`1578142589: OpenSSL Error: error:14094416:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert certificate unknown`

`1578142589: OpenSSL Error: error:140940E5:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:ssl handshake failure`

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using same CA.crt certificate to connect from linux machine at it works fine:

`mosquitto_sub -h` [`192.168.1.8`](https://192.168.1.8) `-t s1/ss --cafile ca.crt -p 8883 -d -u c -P c -i dd`

&amp;#x200B;

What might be wrong with my connection and how to solve this problem.
## [8][[Need advice] AdMob restricted ad serving due to curse words](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ejvto1/need_advice_admob_restricted_ad_serving_due_to/)

Hello, fellow Android devs,

I need advice on what to do in such a situation:

My app plays Russian phrases that are popular in a game called Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I have released 2 versions of an app, one that contains no bad words and another that is basically full of curse words both in English and in Russian (I call this 'rage' version). I had integrated AdMob interstitial ads into both of the apps and it was working fine. However, yesterday I have received a notification that ads were restricted in 'rage' version. The issue is "Adult: Sexual content":

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, the app contains no visual sexual content, only written and spoken phrases, here are some examples (upon pressing the play button the phrase is said in Russian):

*Oh fuck - –ë–ª—è—Ç—å*

*Rush B whore bitch - –†–∞—à –ë c—É–∫–∞ –±–ª—è—Ç—å*

*You make my dick hard with your performance - –£ –º–µ–Ω—è –≤—Å—Ç–∞–ª –æ—Ç —Ç–≤–æ–µ–π –∏–≥—Ä—ã*

&amp;#x200B;

This is how the app looks when you open it:

**Basically, these Ads are my only source of income from these apps. If I want to restore the AdMob serving to my app, what choices do I have?**

**Will it be enough to blur curse words (whole or just one letter)? I don't want to lose user experience.**

**Are there any alternatives to AdMob that does not have such restrictions?**

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! 

I need to identify people with face detection in my app. I haven't been able to find such thing in ml docs. 

Is there any way to identify and compare different faces with ml kit?

Like for example does ml provide an ID for each individual face?

## [12][How to create a custom music database like in Poweramp (my goal is get rid of MediaStore)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ejudns/how_to_create_a_custom_music_database_like_in/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ejudns/how_to_create_a_custom_music_database_like_in/

Poweramp has its own databse with albums/tracks/artists. It detects file changes, links tracks with albums, with artists etc.

I want stop using MediaStore because it is buggy and many users complains about their music not updated, not displaying and so on.
