Hi everyone, this is my first day learning ruby and I have a question about a leap year program I'm writing. In java I'm able to write 

`if((year % 4) == 0){}`

and it would work just fine, and if I'm understanding ruby correctly, which I'm not because I wouldn't otherwise be here, it would be written

`if year % 4 == 0`

`end`

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help me to understand what I'm doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

I want to make a world population counter in Ruby. I don't need the counter to be exact I just want a number to be added every second. Lastly, I don't want the counter to go to the next line whenever it increases in CLI. I want the counter to be in the same position the whole time even when it increases in value. FYI: I might want to add other counters below the population counter in the future.

UPDATE: Just wanted to clarify something... I probably shouldn't have used the wording "most accurate" in my title because I don't really need a lot of precision. If, say, eight decimal places is sufficient, is there a recommended way to handle the numbers? 

-----

I just started incorporating various trig functions into an app and after noticing some inconsistencies here and there, it seems I've stumbled headlong into inaccuracies of how numbers are represented in programming languages.

My question is, is there any recommended way in handling these?

In my research this morning, I've come across 

* Math the Ruby class
* BigDecimal the Ruby class
* BigMath, related to the above
* BigDecimal the Ruby gem (still not sure how this compares to the built-in Ruby class...)

Up to this point, I was relying on the "basic" Math class, which works with floats. I know now this is NOT preferable.

As a concrete example, working with Trig functions using BigMath: 


    rad1 = 45 * BigMath::PI(8) / 180
    rad2 = 135 * BigMath::PI(8) / 180
    cos1 = BigMath::cos(rad1, 8)
    cos2 = BigMath::cos(rad2, 8)

Technically, `cos1` + `cos2` should equal zero, but what is returned is some almost zero number...

So where do I go from here?

Is it recommended to round each number to, say, the 8th decimal place? And if so, do you round for the 
"intermediates" like 

    rad1 = (45 * BigMath::PI(8) / 180).round(8)

 or wait and round the "final answer" like 

    answer = cos1 + cos2 
    answer.round(8)`

Any thoughts or ideas? Or articles/books that could help guide me through this?

FYI: I'm new to Ruby. I'm running a Ruby http server on localhost. How can I get user input with a ruby http server?
