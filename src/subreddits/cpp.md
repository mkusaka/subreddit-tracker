Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

## [2][Matplot++: A C++ Graphics Library for Data Visualization](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iikdwq/matplot_a_c_graphics_library_for_data/)

Data visualization can help programmers and scientists identify trends in their data and efficiently communicate these results with their peers. Modern C++ is being used for a variety of scientific applications, and this environment can benefit considerably from graphics libraries that attend the typical design goals toward scientific data visualization. Besides the option of exporting results to other environments, the customary alternatives in C++ are either non-dedicated libraries that depend on existing user interfaces or bindings to other languages. Matplot++ is a graphics library for data visualization that provides interactive plotting, means for exporting plots in high-quality formats for scientific publications, a compact syntax consistent with similar libraries, dozens of plot categories with specialized algorithms, multiple coding styles, and supports generic backends.

## [3][Why do all guides use #using namespace std if it's supposedly really bad practice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iihj9s/why_do_all_guides_use_using_namespace_std_if_its/)

I'm learning my first programming language and every guide I've seen uses #using namespace std.

But when I look on the internet, everyone calls it a bad habit that one should break as early as possible.

I haven't been able to find a YouTube guide that doesn't use this, but all the guides I've seen have been pretty bad either way. Anyone have any recommendations or advice?

LEAF is a lightweight error handling library for C++11. Features:

* Small single-header format, **no dependencies**.
* Designed for maximum efficiency ("happy" path and "sad" path).
* No dynamic memory allocations, even with heavy payloads.
* O(1) transport of arbitrary error types (independent of call stack depth).
* Can be used with or without exception handling.
* Support for multi-thread programming.

## [8][Range-Vector a header only lib, mimic the python operator [::] on it list, for c++ container.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iiaqdr/rangevector_a_header_only_lib_mimic_the_python/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iiaqdr/rangevector_a_header_only_lib_mimic_the_python/

Hi, I would like to present [Range-Vector](https://github.com/Ail-nare/Range-Vector) a header only lib that I made.

This lib introduce a new class `range` .

The class `range` has for objective to mimic the way python work with the operator `[start:end:step]` on it list. `range` will accept any container that has random access iterator ex: `std::vector`, `const char[N]` etc... .

Ex:

    std::vector src = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    
    for (int i : range(src)(1, {}, 2))
        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ':';
        
    output -&gt; "2:4:6:"

The lib also works with constexpr data such as `constexpr const char[N]` which allow operation on C-style string at compile time.

The lib was primarily developed for C++17, but compile in C++14. In C++17 the templates are deducted, which give a smoother typing.

You can find a more detail presentation of the lib on the [repo](https://github.com/Ail-nare/Range-Vector).

So, the reason of this post is to share this lib to how ever wish to use it. And to have feedback. Especially about error or warring onÂ compilation on other platforms.

Sorry for my english.

Link to tutorial here: [CMake tutorial](http://goorep.se:1001/changelog/report/rSelect/PAGE_result.htm?alias=guest&amp;set=api&amp;query=Book+pages&amp;$$TArticleBook1.ArticleBookK=7107&amp;link=%5B%5B%229F1E006D78894848838A0970E2FF0BE9zoom%22,%22Object1%22,7107%5D,%5B%2271C91DEE3C5A4FDC8EC1114C7C18033Bzoom%22,%22TArticleBook1%22,7107%5D%5D&amp;rows=25)

This documentation differs some from other types of documentation. Docs are stored in a database called changelog. Parts in this  database is structured to manage software documentation. The websystem that runs this database is called Selection. It has many commands and techniques to connect, view and search for information.
I also did a video to  explain some how this application work  
[Getting started with changelog and selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmaue86qseo).

Have been working with this as a side project and it is in the final stage to be released. If you have any ideas or input about the system that runs the database feel free to tell me.  
It is quite advanced because the system is primarily made for internal use (on premise)

The CMake tutorial and API documentation are expanded with more examples and text over time.
