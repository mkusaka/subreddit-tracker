Hey guys, this is my first post.

Ive been doing react for couple of months now, self learn.  I was wondering how does the common corporate or startup or even yourself Structure your react project? 

Like how do you decide this certain thing should be a component and where would you write all your functions? 

 And what kind of tools do you use to help with your development (Redux, MobX, Jest, and so on)?

Appreciate it thanks

So I am developing a website in which a user can post any data in any Indian Language like Hindi, English, Bengali, Tamil etc

I have 3 queries related to it.

First is which kind of rendering should i go with, server side or client side. The user interaction which changes the state of site are normal stuff like, comments, review, rating, voting . when user posts something, it will create a message saying that it is sent to moderation. Comments/review and votes are to be added on stop. Otherwise other stuff on the site is static in nature, so for this scenario , which is better , and should proceed with, i am still not clear about CSR  and SSR. 

&amp;#x200B;

2nd query is that I am planning to use MERN stack. So how can i make an editor which will allow the user to type in the Indian language, and how can i port this to  mobile site. What APIs can i use , and what options do i have.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd-When user is selecting a particular language, i am thinking of redirecting different sub domain.

Like if he selects Marathi, then i will redirect to mr.abc.com something , what changes do i have to make for routing and database base. Does the user needs to register on every domain separately or just registration works

&amp;#x200B;

Could really use your advice.

Let's say I have an application that each user have their own subdomain and theme. How can I select the page theme accordingly to the subdomain with react since the react router doesn't deal with subdomains?

Thanks!
