We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

This isn't really ReactJS specific, but what measures should be taken to prevent people from stealing sensitive API keys for google maps etc by simply going into network requests in inspect element?

After one year of fast track in Web Dev, I arrived in the job-hunting mode now. But I am having difficulties describing myself as a react developer. I mean, I can show up some projects, or say I know x, y, z in react, but beyond that, I really can't think of any other way to differentiate myself in my resume. Any suggestion? Thanks!
## [11][IOT Dashboard with ReactJS (and MQTT?!?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fk3olb/iot_dashboard_with_reactjs_and_mqtt/)

Hi there! I'm new to reactJS and I have a very basic but conceptual question:

I would like to build a responsive Webpage for an IOT dashboard (with ReactJS) and I'm struggling with way too many options on how to start, component variety and so on...!

My main concern now is: how do I get live IoT data (most efficiently) into such a react dashboard?

My core IOT system is a simple Mosquito MQTT broker + Node-Red.

Would be MQTT.js (via websocket) be a good option in order to get data into a reactJS page?

What other options are suitable/available?

It would be really great if someone could give me some starting guidance/tutorial on essential bits and pieces to start with.

(I started to experiment with create-react-app, material-ui, mqtt.js, char.js ... but I'm not sure if I'm on the right path here ... especially the mqtt suff worries me, as I hardly can find useful tutorials on it...)

Any help would be really appreciated! Thank you in advance!
