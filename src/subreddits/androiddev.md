This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Does anybody experienced this after updating to Android Studio 3.5.3?

    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;project version="4"&gt;
      &lt;component name="AndroidLayouts"&gt;
        &lt;shared&gt;
          &lt;config&gt;
            &lt;device id="pixel" /&gt;
          &lt;/config&gt;
        &lt;/shared&gt;
      &lt;/component&gt;
      &lt;component name="AndroidLogFilters"&gt;
        &lt;option name="TOOL_WINDOW_CONFIGURED_FILTER" value="Show only selected application" /&gt;
      &lt;/component&gt;
      &lt;component name="ChangeListManager"&gt;
        &lt;list default="true" id="5f8ee286-50de-4b3e-b06b-452c3d44810a" name="Default Changelist" comment=""&gt;
          &lt;change beforePath="$PROJECT_DIR$/build.gradle" beforeDir="false" afterPath="$PROJECT_DIR$/build.gradle" afterDir="false" /&gt;
          &lt;change be

These just randomly occur every time I check a file I just updated. Then lint alerts that a random class used in the file cannot be located because the file was magically rewritten. I did not even update that file.

I am a first year college student, and would really like to learn mobile app development. I've searched around on the internet, but aren't quite sure how to proceed yet. i signed up for the course on Shaw Academy, but after reading more about it I don't know whether that's the best idea. Can anyone guide me as to how I Should proceed? Any online course recommendations would be highly helpful, and even if not, any other ways I could start learning?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

There is literally ONE bit of sample code for this and it crashes in its own address space on Android 8, 9 and 10. Documentation is just about nil and can't find any other references to it anywhere even though it's been a thing since Android M. 

Any leads would be awesome, want to use it to pair with a robotic Bluetooth arm that is mounted to a wheelchair.

TIA
## [12][How to access nested local jar](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/elrzf5/how_to_access_nested_local_jar/)

I have this app that uses a local jar. The app also has a dependency on a self created library that also contains that same local jar. If i remove the local jar from my app it cannot access the jar from my library. Is there any way to do this so i only need to have the jar in my library and not in my app?

Thanks in advance :)
