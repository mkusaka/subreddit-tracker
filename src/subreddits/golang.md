It's a lightweight, fast, **Terminal-UI based Golang app**.

[https://github.com/ajaxray/geek-life](https://github.com/ajaxray/geek-life)

I was finding for a generic To-do list manager in CLI with "Project =&gt; TaskList" view. Didn't find any. So, I started developing one for myself and anyone who -

* Loves and live with his dark terminal
* Thinks and writes in markdown

If you're a geek, try it. It's free and open source.

If you're a go developer, contribution and suggestion is much appreciated! (Also, don't forget to ðŸŒŸ the repo)

Hey everyone. I'm new to go and come from a PHP MVC background. I have a very basic project working in go that accesses a table in mysql and passes the content via an API endpoint to a Vue component. All of the go code is written in main.go

Before I continue learning and experimenting I would like to get the basic structure of the project files correct so that I practice good habits from the get go.

Would any of you be able to recommend a decent project structure and a good example of how to split code into different kinds of responsibilities (and what those responsibilities might be).

An example in PHP that I would often use would be a folder for controllers, a router file that calls the controllers, a model folder that holds instances from the database, resources including views+js+css, repositories (and factories) which generate and manipulate models, services which abstract out controller logic into reusable methods

Many thanks

## [9][Forever channel terminating the program and go channel with RabbitMQ consumer](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/h8psve/forever_channel_terminating_the_program_and_go/)

I am new to GO and writing program in GO and also RMQ consumer with go channel and came to these scenarios.

**"go forever channel" blocks the main thread until it gets stop signal from other go routine".**

But below program 1 tells deadlock error, and **program 2** works fine without deadlock error,

why it's happening?  


**Program 1** : Go routine printing element in loop and deadlock error

        package main
        import "fmt"
        
        func main() {
            stopProgram := make(chan bool)
            
            go func() {
              for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {
                 fmt.Println("hello ",i)
              }
              // Send signal through stopProgram to stop loop
              //stopProgram &lt;- true
            }()
    
    
           // your problem will wait here until it get stop signal through channel
           &lt;-stopProgram
           fmt.Println("after forever channel")
        }

**Output**

                    }
            }()
          
            // your problem will wait here until it get stop signal through channel
            &lt;-stopProgram
            fmt.Println("after forever channel")
        }

Can anybody clear the things here(i am new to GO) that how forever channel works here ?

**My assumption** \- In program 1, go routing ends after printing hello 5 times and there is no infinite execution in current routine/any other routine or stop signal to forever go channel.

If we want to use forever go channel(or block the main Go routine to stay in a specific go routine), we have to make sure these things 

 1. Either go routines ensures the infinite execution OR 

 2. Go routine sends the stop signal to forever channel.
