I'm having an issue importing various classes for mocha testing, for my Typescript project. I have included the following stackoverflow post for reference:

npm start works just fine but npm test is throwing an error where \[Class\] is not a constructor for most classes in my project.

## [5][Dependency Injection: inversifyJS vs tsyringe](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i0jdmn/dependency_injection_inversifyjs_vs_tsyringe/)

 I am new to DI.

I could not find a good comparison of the two frameworks. On the first look tsyringe looks more elegant to me. It seems to auto register classes. In inversifyJS you seem to have to bind every class to the container first before it couls be injected? On the other hanf inversifyJS is much more popular (but is also older). Why is this?

Any PROs &amp; CONs?

Thank you!

New TS user here and while setting up a dev workflow, I am confused between the two for local development:  

1. Use `ts-node` to watch for changes and run `*.ts` files without transpiling to JS.
2. Transpile to JS first and then run the `*.js` files.

Option 1 looks more natural to me but I wouldn't know for sure if my transpiled JS files work as expected. Option 2 would make sure my transpiled JS files work as expected but that would require transpiling on EVERY file change. This question was asked [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/9o1zzp/tsnode_vs_compiling_for_development/) as well but I couldn't find a satisfactory answer.

Thanks!
## [7][Help with mutating functions](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i06arp/help_with_mutating_functions/)

I'm having some difficulty wrapping my head around what I'm trying to do using Typescript with a function that mutates data.  

Let's say I have a person entity who can be either sitting or standing.  I want to make a function that will make him "stand up".  The function should only work on sitting entities and not allow you to pass an entity that is already standing.  After the function has done its work, it should assert that the entity is now standing, and after the function has been run allow you to continue with code that operates on standing entities.

Here's an example of the kind of thing I'm trying to do.  The error is obviously that it ends up in the `never` type, because the intersection of an entity that was sitting, but is now standing, is `never`

    interface Person {
      name: string;
      position: 'SITTING' | 'STANDING';
    }

    interface SittingPerson extends Person {
      position: 'SITTING';
    }

    interface StandingPerson extends Person {
      position: 'STANDING';
    }

    const bob: SittingPerson = { name: 'Bob', position: 'SITTING' };

    function standUp(p: SittingPerson): asserts p is StandingPerson {
      p.position = 'STANDING';
    }

    standUp(bob);

On the line:

    function standUp(p: SittingPerson): asserts p is StandingPerson 

there is an error that SittingPerson is not assignable to StandingPerson.  Obviously this is true, but what I'd like to be able to say to Typescript is:

`"Make your assertion based on the value at the end of the function, not at the start"`

I'm aware of this code immediately starts working if I simply make `bob` a `Person` instead of a `SittingPerson`, however the point is that I explicitly know which state he is in already, I don't want to define him as the less specific `Person`.  I don't want people to be able to invoke `standUp` on a person who may already be standing.  I want it to be as clear and concise as possible.

I'm wondering if I'm going about this the wrong way, and if there's a better way to do what I'm trying to do.

The reason it's using mutation rather than just returning a new person entity, is that it's in the context of a game, so these actions could potentially be happening countless times in a short period, so mutation is preferred vs creating new objects.

Thanks for any help
## [8][How to unit test private object variables mocha chai for typescript project?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i08u9i/how_to_unit_test_private_object_variables_mocha/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i08u9i/how_to_unit_test_private_object_variables_mocha/

After researching this I found the best response would be to test the private variables of an object against the prototype of the object. Effectively then inside the test creating a prototype and accessing the variables in that way. When I do this, however, it seems that all variables are not null but are undefined. How am I able to test the private variables, so that they remain defined? For reference, this is what I'm doing now:

Questions in the title .

Edit :

My bad for not wording it properly .

I am not looking at default exporting two things .

I am looking on being able to default export a type . Also I am looking on being able to default export an interface without name .

There will always be one default export in each module .

I just had two different and not related question not worded properly .

Edit : 

Problem solved : [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hzzxti/is_it_possible_to_default_export_a_type_and/fzmr3t1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) is how to default export a type . [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hzzxti/is_it_possible_to_default_export_a_type_and/fzmnme2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) is how to default export an interface (you have to use a name on the definition of the interface ).

I have a Typescript project where I read in `AmazonRootCA1.pem` for fully functioning `AwsIotRestApi`. That is, when I run the API it seems to be working just fine. I want to test the API with mocha. When I attempt to do so I get the following error:

    Error: error:0909006C:PEM routines:get_name:no start line

`AmazonRootCA1.pem`, the file which is being read is correctly formatted, so I'm not entirely sure how to go about solving this. Would anyone know how to resolve this error?

I have been experimenting with using \`Array.from\` and \`reduce\` to build the output file instead of the \`for of\`, but keep on running into syntax problems. Any input? Would be great to get a mini code review.

The purpose of the program is to let you copy/paste YouTube chapters from creators' videos and make a chapter file that can be used with .mkv and .mp4 videos. Perfect for videos downloaded with \`youtube-dl\`.

I had the whole thing as a function before, but have been reading about domain-driven design and now think it belongs in a class. The 'chapter file' is definitely a 'domain concept'
