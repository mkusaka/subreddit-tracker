Probably the title is wrong, i couldn't figure out how to explain it. Here is a simplified version of the problem.

    type Foo&lt;T&gt; = { getValue: () =&gt; T; };
    
    function createFoo&lt;T&gt;(value: T): Foo&lt;T&gt; { return { getValue: () =&gt; value }; }
    
    let items = { apple: createFoo(1), orange: createFoo('hello'), };
    
    function combine(items) { // }
    
    let combined = combine({ apple, orange });
    
    /* combined's type should be { apple: number, orange: string } */

Thank you :)

Edit: Switched to Markdown. I really need to see if there's a way to set that to default. Also, apologies for the syntax highlighting in Pastebin. Is there a better service to share TS code?

For practice I'm working on an algorithm that assigns values as (object) key names. The keys are paired to an array.

This is in raw  JS. In TS I don't know how to handle objects with dynamic key names:

    { joe : [{...}, {...}, {...}], sally : [{...}, {...}]  } 

(key names will vary)

Anyone know how to properly type these?

Trying to grok `typedi` and came up with this. Is following right?

1. `@Inject()` injects `Container` into decorated class properties,  
*Hint: **InjectContainer**IntoProp*
2. `@Service()` injects `Container` into decorated classes via constructor params,  
*Hint: **InjectContainer**IntoClassViaConstructorParams*
3. `@Service{'&lt;name&gt;')` injects `Container` into decorated classes and provides that classes via `&lt;name&gt;` via `Container.get('&lt;name&gt;')`,  
*Hint: **InjectContainer**IntoClassViaConstructorParamsAnd**ProvideClass**ViaAlias*

1 is mandatory for classes without a constructor. 2 is mandatory if a constructor with params injects the dependency. 3 is the one which actually act as a *service*.

A more intuitive naming scheme would have been:  
1: `@InjectToProp()`   
2: `@InjectViaConstructor()`  
3: `@ProvideAs('&lt;name&gt;')`

Hello all,

I am learning Typescript and I was naming my interfaces happily until I arrived to Mongodb/Mongoose.  


For example, I had before an interface called User. However, when I create my model schema, in mongo without Typescript I would have called this User as well. Therefore, that would create a conflict.  


Is there a common convention about this?  


I see this guy in the link down below uses IUser but I have read also that Typescript community does not like using Iwhatever... and personally I do not like that either.

Therefore, do you know what is the most common way to naming mongo stuff and interfaces?  


Thank you in advance.
