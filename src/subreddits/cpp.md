Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

GCC 10.2 is a bug-fix release from the GCC 10 branch containing important fixes for regressions and serious bugs in GCC 10.1 with more than 94 bugs fixed since the previous release. Bug list: [https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug\_status=RESOLVED&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;target\_milestone=10.2](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;target_milestone=10.2)

Take a look at this [masterpiece](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.cc#L39). The level of amateurism in Google's C++ libraries is stunning. This is just one link to one problem, but there are numerous places I can point to. I think Google fell into the trap of hiring a bunch of smart graduates who are good at solving puzzles. Now they have inmates running the asylum. They hire what they think are best of the best. In reality, they hire a bunch of kids that have no experience and no perspective. What they get is falling way behind the industry in best practices. They're basically just throwing money at every problem. I think I've ranted enough, any comments/opinions?

## [10][Could C++23 executors be used for GPU?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hwrphi/could_c23_executors_be_used_for_gpu/)

I just want to put out there that the C++23 spec isn't set in stone, etc, etc.

But upon reading about C++ executors I've noticed one of the goals was for it to be heterogeneous with the goal of running a callable object on an internal or external processor and reading it back to an internal or external processor. Would GPU's qualify for this?

[ModernCOM on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexBAV/moderncom)

This library is a header-only lightweight wrapper for utilizing, declaring and implementing of Windows COM (Component Object Model)  interfaces.

This is the code required to define `MyObject` class that implements two COM interfaces, `IFirstInterface` and `ISecondInterface`:

```c++
#include &lt;moderncpp/interfaces.h&gt;

class MyObject :
  public belt::com::object&lt;
    MyObject, // our class
    IFirstInterface,  // any number of interfaces
    ISecondInterface&gt; // we implement
{
  // Implement methods of IFirstInterface
  ...
  // Implement methods of ISecondInterface
  ...

  public:
    // MyObject may optionally have non-empty constructor that is
    // allowed to throw exceptions
    MyObject(int a, int b);
};
```
