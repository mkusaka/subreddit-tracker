We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I know Kent Dodds gained fame through javascript testing course, but even after 40% off $359 seems insanely expensive for 19 hours of video instructions compare to 30 hours of popular Udemy react course that you can get for $10 on sale. Has anybody taken his course before? What's your opinion of him? Anybody considering buying this course at current price?
## [5][Learn Django+React by building real SaaS products from scratch](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2in8m/learn_djangoreact_by_building_real_saas_products/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2in8m/learn_djangoreact_by_building_real_saas_products/
---
I would like to start a series of tutorials that will show how to build SaaS (software as a service) products from the scratch with Django and React. I would like to ask a community what they need from such tutorials? Are they needed? 

An example tutorial will look like:

- I will build a web service for scheduling posts on social media. What will the service do? You enter the link and a title in the web service and web service will post it on selected social media channels (automated posting).
- The service will be open-source. It will be deployed and ready for use.
- I will write a detailed step-by-step tutorial on how the service was created. So you can recreate it from scratch. Or you can modify it and create your own SaaS.

My experience:

- Tutorial on how to deploy machine learning models with Django: https://www.deploymachinelearning.com/ - it is very detailed and I got a lot of positive feedback
- Automated Machine Learning SaaS: https://mljar.com
- AutoML Python package: https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised

The stack that I'm using: Javascript + React + Redux in the front-end. For backend I'm using Python + Django + Django REST Framework + PostgreSQL + Celery. Deploy with Docker on AWS.

The website with information: https://saasitive.com

I'm waiting for your feedback. What would you like to see in such tutorials?

## [7][Is there a tool which shows a visualised tree structure for the components along with the their local and global states?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2kljl/is_there_a_tool_which_shows_a_visualised_tree/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2kljl/is_there_a_tool_which_shows_a_visualised_tree/
---
I don't know if such tool exists or not, I tried to find it but I wasn't sure how to exactly search for that.

Wouldn't it be really helpful if we could have a tool which makes a tree of our project code. It will be even better if you can see the state values in it , this way we can tell which component has stale state when we're using global state.

Hello everyone, 

I've built a group of menu components with React.

It has some great functionalities that are not offered in many popular React libraries.

Welcome to try it out from my GitHub page at: [https://szhsin.github.io/react-menu/](https://szhsin.github.io/react-menu/)

Feel free to submit GitHub issues if you find bugs or have feature requests.

Happy coding!
## [9][useEffect hook cleaning function](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2lmz4/useeffect_hook_cleaning_function/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2lmz4/useeffect_hook_cleaning_function/
---
Hey Guys,

I have a question regarding the cleaning phase of an effect (useEffect function's return function).

From what I understand at each render, the effect function is re-evaluated and is scheduled for execution once the render is complete. How about the return function which is used for cleaning? If at each run, we return a new cleaning function which one is going to get executed once the component is detached? Is it the last one? Or is it going to be all of those functions?

## [12][I just finished a React-Native mobile app and want to make a web version of it. Is it okay to stick to RN with RN-web or should I really switch to ReactJS](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2irqg/i_just_finished_a_reactnative_mobile_app_and_want/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/j2irqg/i_just_finished_a_reactnative_mobile_app_and_want/
---
I have built several pages with ReactJS, as well as mobile apps with React Native. However, I never used React Native for the web.

I am about to release a React Native mobile app and I want to create a web version of it. The UI will be quite different, but the core functionalities will be the same.

To make it easier to reuse my code and maintain both versions, I am considering using React Native web. 

Considering that it is a quite complex app, is it a good move, or should I prefer ReactJS when it comes to webdev?

I am mostly worried about finding out late in the process that RN limits what I can do on the web somehow, or affects performances.
