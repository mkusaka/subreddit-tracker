This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I often get asked from potential employers if I've published any apps on the Play Store, and I say no. I've been doing Android apps for 4 years now but I've always been hesitant to publish one out of the fear of getting banned like how so many have been. But I feel like I'm missing out on opportunity. What's the best way I can go about this?

This is the first time I am publishing an app on play store I submitted my game for review in play store and it bean 20 hours still no response and Google says it will take more time to review,but it doesn't specify how much time can someone say how much time it take , because I needed to plan accordingly
## [9][What are in your opinion the best ad services to implement in an Android Studio project besides AdMob?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j93w54/what_are_in_your_opinion_the_best_ad_services_to/)

I have experienced using AdMob with my first app before summer, and although it seems like a great service, with easy implementation, the bad part comes when you actually want the ads to work, or expect to get paid. I mean, in order for AdMob ads to work, I got a message from Google AdSense that I need to verify my physical address using a verification code. I did just this (3 times) and have been waiting since before this summer, but the verification code never arrived (and I doubt it ever will). By the way, I live in Eastern Europe.

Therefore, I am trying to look for alternatives to AdMob, because I don't want to have to wait for my address to be verified. It either takes too long, or it never takes place XDDD

I heard from some people here that Unity Ads might be a good alternative. But I also wanted to hear others' opinions.

Thank you so much in advance!
