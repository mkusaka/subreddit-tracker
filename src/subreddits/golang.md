Is there any good blogs or tutorial available on how to *upload* and get *uploaded* files using postgres and golang.

Just found out about this and definitely a pretty cool implementation if you like Jupyter Notebooks.

&amp;#x200B;

It works on Mac, Linux, and Windows. There's also a Docker image that you can easily spin up. [https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes)

I'll definitely be working on a YouTube video and some posts about this via Twitter: TheNJDevOpsGuy
## [7][A lib to make parallel go testing less verbose](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/j33etw/a_lib_to_make_parallel_go_testing_less_verbose/)

Repo: [github.com/ysmood/got](https://github.com/ysmood/got)

So that you won't forget to write `t.Parallel()` in every test case.

```go
package main_test

import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/ysmood/got"
)

func Test(t *testing.T) {
    got.Each(t, func(t *testing.T) S {
        t.Parallel()
        return S{got.New(t)}
    })
}

type S struct {
    got.Assertion
}

func (s S) A() { // just like the: func TestA(t *testing.T) {}
    s.Eq(1, 1.0)
}

func (b S) B() {
    b.Eq([]int{1, 2}, []int{1, 2})
}
```

The lib has zero dependencies. It's easy to use it with any other assert lib, such as testify:

```go
package main_test

import (
	"testing"
	"time"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/ysmood/got"
)

func Test(t *testing.T) {
    got.Each(t, func(t *testing.T) Suite {
        return Suite{assert.New(t)}
    })
}

type Suite struct {
	*assert.Assertions
}

func (s Suite) A() {
	s.Equal(1, 1)
}

func (s Suite) B() {
	s.Equal(2, 1)
}
```

Hey guys,
a few weeks ago, I mentioned here that we'll OSS our GraphQL integration for [ent](https://github.com/facebook/ent). So, as promised, here's the link to the docs [entgo.io/docs/graphql](https://entgo.io/docs/graphql/), and to the [entgql extension](https://github.com/facebookincubator/ent-contrib) in GitHub. 


What exactly we currently provide in this integration: 

- [Node API](https://entgo.io/docs/graphql/#node-api) support. 

- [Pagination support](https://entgo.io/docs/graphql/#pagination) - Follows the *Relay Cursor Connections Spec*.

- [Connection Ordering](https://entgo.io/docs/graphql/#connection-ordering).

- [Fields Collection](https://entgo.io/docs/graphql/#fields-collection) - (*This one is super cool!*) Auto eager-load relations/edges that exist in the GraphQL request.

- [Transactional Mutations](https://entgo.io/docs/graphql/#transactional-mutations) - A handler that executes each GraphQL mutation in a transaction and either commit or rollback the transaction based on the response. 

- And additional small features that makes the binding between the 2 libraries much friendly. See the docs for more details.
 
We are actively working to improve the integration between the 2 libraries and we expect to OSS additional options in the future. If you're using gqlgen and ent, please give it a look/try and let me know what do you think :)

Hey guys, I'm looking for some project recommendations that could get me started on a tech career.

I've been learning Go for two months now, and I am pretty comfortable with the basics up to concurrency and channeling, those are still a challenge. Anyway, I'm looking for a couple of projects that I can do as a beginner to build experience and portfolio, but I'm struggling to find something that could get the attention of recruiters. Can you please suggest something to steer me the right way?

I also have experience with React, but wouldn't like to go for the web backend route of Go. 

Thanks

Mine are boring but wondering if others do similar?

I often say semi involuntarily to myself:

1./ Another one bites the dust.
2./ Back in business.
3./ Right, lets get the party started people.
