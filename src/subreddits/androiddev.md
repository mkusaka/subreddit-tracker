I've lost access to my Google Developer Account, I have just forgotten my password and didn't set any recovery e-mail earlier (yes, I know, this was very dumb). I was trying very hard to recover access to my account with no luck.

The biggest problem is that while you are trying to contact Google Play developer support you are getting a response only from bots, so you can't find any help there, they only guide you through the account recovery process which is useless in my case.

My situation is like losing a ticket from a parking lot and getting a car stuck there forever.

Fortunately, the app was not promoted so there aren't any real users. So I am looking for any guerilla ways to force Google to unpublish this app (so then I can reupload it on another account).

Since still I have access to the back-end I could upload images like "your android contains a virus" and report it to Google â€“ but in this case, I was also totally ignored by them.

Do you have any idea how to get rid of this? What is the best way to make sure that Google would unpublish this app? Maybe buying fake 1-star reviews would help?

Are there Android APIs that allow to implement a video chat between two users and to stream the content to other users? If not, what would be the best approach to do it?

Perhaps I am missing something here, but the build is Google app data backup is totally worthless and not fit for purpose?

It seems to only backup/restore to the same device, and if you uninstall, it gets wiped.  What on earth is the point of it?  What use-cases does it actually solve?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my app for several years has allowed users to export their content to external storage and back in again, either on the same device, share it with friends, a different device, I don't care, it's their content.   As google has slowly locked down SD card access, it's become harder and hard to support this across all API versions, and with the data backup being so naff, I am looking for some other ideas.

My content I want to share/backup is just a JSON file of data, a single file.  What real backup sharing options do I have, if I want to target API30?   Is there a way of sharing the file and importing/exporting with Google Drive?  Any libs that can help with this?

  
Thanks.

I got a prompt from the Google Play Console which said "
Changes to subscription settings
You must have account hold and restore implemented in your app by November 1, 2020. Subscription pause and resubscribe will also be enabled by default, unless you explicitly opt out." I'm not sure exactly what this means as my app is free and has no subscription required, does anyone know?
