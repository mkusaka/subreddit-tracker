I decided to see if i could make a working klondike with React and React DnD. I hadn't tried DnD in anything before this and just started hacking away :)

I used maybe  \~12-14 hours in total during 1 month period. Some of the decisions made are not the best for sure but i am overall happy with it.

Any comments would be apprecited there's some things mentiond that I need to improve in the repo.

I've been using Jest/Jasmine for a long while; frustrating but front-end-testing is just hard.  Cypress DRAMATICALLY improves testing and a PLEASURE to use.  It is a bit different...very "browser" oriented and 'speed' feels like a user is really typing/waiting, but the philosophy is cool. Why? Because they know what and how you need to test so async basically goes-away (absorbed by their api/wait/try) and debugging is a breeze.  If anyone needs any tips/tricks, contact me!  Also,  I know it wont test non-DOM (React Native) but I'm hopeful if 90% of my project is pure-react, the benefit carries forward. Love to hear thoughts on that.

I am creating a custom newsfeed which retrieves articles from RSS feeds and stores them in different collections based on category in MongoDB.

I am able to display only one category in my front end. The one which I am defining last is the one that gets rendered. The rest don't really show. I want it to display in three flex containers that have scroll but the scroll isn't working either. It's only showing a set number of articles and I need to zoom out. (This is probably a frontend/css question that I will ask)

But yeah I'd like to know why my remaining components aren't rendering.

I want a guage like this:  [https://imgur.com/32Froe0](https://imgur.com/32Froe0). 

In addition it would be great if the color gets changed (ex: darker or brighter) the more full or empty it is. So far I haven't found one capable of doing that. Does anyone know of any like that? Or is there an easy to build something like that from scratch?
## [10][useState with Suspense causes rerender loop?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ez7oaq/usestate_with_suspense_causes_rerender_loop/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ez7oaq/usestate_with_suspense_causes_rerender_loop/

Hello, I am working with Suspense and want to be able to generate a new random number when a button is pressed. I have an issues though where `useState` keeps invoking the initial function passed into it, therefore rerendering the component. I have no idea why this is occurring and have been banging my head against the wall. The only thing that has worked so far is to pass in the promise as a prop but that means that the button to generate a new promise needs to be extracted to this component's parent. I am trying to keep all of the logic encapsulated.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    const SuspenseWrapper = (promise) =&gt; {
	    let status = 'pending';
	    let result = '';
	    let suspender = promise.then(
	    	    (r) =&gt; {
	    		    status = 'success';
	    		    result = r;
	    	    },
		    (e) =&gt; {
			    status = 'error';
			    result = e;
		    }
	    );

	    return {
		    read: () =&gt; {
			    if (status === 'pending') {
				    throw suspender;
			    } else if (status === 'error') {
				    throw result;
			    } else {
				    return result;
			    }
		    }
	    };
    };

    const getNumber = async () =&gt; {
	    return await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
		    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
			    const randomNumber = Math.random();

			    if (randomNumber &gt;= 0) {
				    resolve(randomNumber);
			    }
			    reject({ message: 'Number is less than 0.5' });
		    }, 2000);
	    });
    };

    export default () =&gt; {
	    const [ wrappedPromise, setWrappedPromise ] = useState(SuspenseWrapper(getNumber()));
	    const number = wrappedPromise.read();

	    return (
		    &lt;React.Fragment&gt;
			    &lt;div&gt;{number}&lt;/div&gt;
			    &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setWrappedPromise(SuspenseWrapper(getNumber()))}&gt;Generate New     Number&lt;/button&gt;
		    &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
	    );
    };

Hey, I made a voting web app while learning react. Im not a professional web dev but someday hope to be. Took me a long time, but this is currently a side hobby, as I work full time. Let me know what you think. If you sign up, look for the verification email in your spam, and mark as not spam. 

I used MERN stack with redux. Deployed on digitalocean.  It is only yes or no voting, and you can make public or private votes. Private votes send a text message and email (again check your spam) with unique link to that vote to each voter.

The app is at:   https://yessno.tk

I really loved learning react and am currently building a portfolio app with react as well. Any feedback would be great.
