This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [6][Is it alright to have a navigation graph this big? Or should I take the extra effort to split it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iyu6hf/is_it_alright_to_have_a_navigation_graph_this_big/)

So currently my Navigation Graph looks something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/mhvn4pq4g2p51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f84cca0e0ed6fa330a14b9f3a56c9748f01787

As per the documentation, I can split this into multiple nav graphs to make it smaller. But is it worth doing it since this nav graph is only around 240 lines of code and much smaller than some layouts.

Is it worth splitting it into multiple parts? Or do you have bigger nav graphs than this?

We have a utility app for car owners and we sell yearly/lifetime subscription. Our weekly revenue fluctuates a lot.  

We get most of our install through Google Adwords and the spend/week is more or less is the same.   
One week the revenue is going to be - $200 and the next week it would be $100 and so on.    
What could be the reason for this?   
we have looked at the ad campaign and they are performing well. We send notifications but they are also the same.

I didn't even know what was Local history until now. 

I thought i was done with the current feature, so i made my "final commit". But i forgot something, so i reseted the commit, did my change...  Then all the sudden i had a brain fart, instead of making a commit again, i reseted my files. So seeming i lost the past few hours work. 

Turns out, AS / IJ keeps track of your changes. So i was able to reset the last 'External change' (git), reverting my changes (restoring the commit).

I have no affiliation with Coding in Flow, but he has a 5min tutorial on [Local History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A5F34TofMY)
