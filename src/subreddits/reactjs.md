We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I have an interview coming up this wednesday. The recruiter said that the company is looking for a reactjs dev and the company is going to ask questions from my resume. This is going to be my first time giving an interview (a little nervous), what should i expect?

Hello all! My question is how far can you push a React app using only React Hooks for state management before resorting to Redux or something like it? I assume I could make a form-over-fields with some complex validation and perhaps dynamic fields, but I would like some of your thoughts on where and if its got a breaking point.

Hello everyone, I came back to one of my old projects and I have hit a road block. The project is a movie discover app.

The problem I am facing, I am rendering on the FE multiple movie list view components with like movie title, description etc

Desired flow:

Base state

```state = Object.freeze({
           favorite: []
         })```

1.	Have button component - ‚ÄúFavorite‚Äù
2.	 When clicked on ‚ÄúFavorite‚Äù, populate data set to state (data are comming from props, which are fetched from api)
3.	If clicked on another, push the next data into state
4.	In state I should see ```[{...},{...}] ``` as I have added 2 items into state
5.	Retreive data from state, save into localStorage
6.	From another component retreive data from localStorage and render it, data from localStorage are used for another component on another route

Current flow:

1.	Clicked on ‚ÄúFavorite‚Äù
2.	Data populated - [{...}]
3.	Add another item into favorite, data is not pushed into arr, it will overwrite previous data

 [Gist of the helper function](https://github.com/tomasvn/react-repo/blob/80257a770e4f15be8401fc2a3f056204190eb8c1/react-movie-discover-new/src/components/MovieListItem.js#L15)

Tried, failed approach

1.	Use `this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({...prevState.favorite, data})`
2.	create `const data = []` and use `data.push({...})` and then use setState

If you need more info happy to provide

I'm having a hard time trying to find a decent one. Half are unmaintained, others are buggy or missing features. The only potential candidate is a "pro" one that's paid and not open source and the 'lite' version looks like it has a lot of issues on its github.

I'd love something like fancybox for react. This is what I mean: http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/ It just works. But it relies on jQuery. Apparently the dev of fancybox is working on making it no longer rely on jQuery, so that should make it easier to use with react, but seems like it'll be a little while off.

Here's the one's I've been through

- https://github.com/xiaolin/react-image-gallery - No modal/lightbox (that I can see). Can't swipe on desktop. No zoom (only fullscreen, which is not the same).
- https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox - Possibly abandoned. 
- https://github.com/jossmac/react-images - No longer maintained/abandoned.
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-react-lightbox - Best so far but is super buggy on image zoom, makes the feature unusuable. 
- https://fslightbox.com/ - the "pro" one I mentioned

Any suggestions? At this point I'm wondering if it's worth it to just bite the bullet and pull jquery on the page and use fancybox until the dev can make it vanilla js. But if anyone knows of any decent React based ones, I'm all ears!
