I am learning Material UI and the problem I am facing is that I don't know how to design the layout in order to make it Material Design compliant.

I mean, Material UI gives me a lot of loose components which look great, but how am I supposed to put them together so that the WHOLE thing looks good and UX friendly? Do you guys use any software for this?

Seriously, learning about testing in react is increasingly hard because of plethora of stupid hello world articles.

I do have some experience in it since I do it on my job but I would like to expand my skillset

I would like in-depth material on this. Thanks!

So I graduated from my college this January 2020 and landed an internship at a Startup but the problem is they're paying me quite low even after I worked with dedication for them and got converted to full time I mean honestly according to me the pay is below par. Just so let you all know I am experienced in writing both React and Angular (but I prefer React) code and I wouldn't say I have developed extraordinary applications with them but I can develop quite good things with them (especially with React). Honestly I really love and enjoy reading new stuff and learning new things in React but when I apply for the Jobs with better I'm always rejected with the statement *"you lack experience".* I'm really confused about how should I proceed with my career?

Just to give you overview I'm vell versed with all this:

1. React

* Props, State
* Hooks
* Component Lifecycles (tbh I do require some help in this)
* Redux, Context API
* CSS Modules, CSS in JS
* REST API integration using both **axios** and **fetch** &amp; Building **Forms**
* React Router and using almost any other library with it

Normal Stuff that I'm also good with

* **CSS Frameworks**: Semantic UI, Bulma and my fav. Bootstrap
* **CSS Preprocessor**: SASS
* **Node.js**: I can build basic CRUD APIs and also familiar with Jade and Pug Templating 
* **Angular**: Dependency Injections, Behaviour Subject, Forms, Routing, ViewChild, Eventemitter
* **JavaScript**: I try to adapt to new syntax as much as possible, familiar with all the functions like map, filter, reduce etc and concepts like hoisting, closure
* Also I can write **jQuery** too (though anyone who has written JS can write it)

Please help me in moving forward as I really want to become a really good frontend developer and earn decent pay so that I could pay off my student loans and do something good in this field. I know the stuff written above is quite normal to any experienced FE Dev. but that's why I want to improve myself and become a better Dev, any critics please answer where am I going wrong I'm really open to listening any flaws. 

\*\*\* If any other info required will be happy to answer in comments and message as well.
## [11][React router dom Links vs just rendering components](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ggezdn/react_router_dom_links_vs_just_rendering/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ggezdn/react_router_dom_links_vs_just_rendering/

Hello guys. 

So... here‚Äôs my curiosity. What‚Äôs better:

1. Have in your main App.js routes to separate page components and render in App.js a Nav component that Links to the different pages

2. Have a navigation component in App.js that uses state and based on the value of the state (0, 1, 2 and so on based on how many pages you have) render different page conponents. 

Example: 
In App.js just render &lt;NavComponent /&gt; and in NavComponent.js you have
{state === 0 &amp;&amp; &lt;HomeComponent /&gt;}
{state === 1 &amp;&amp; &lt;OtherComponent /&gt;}

I hope I made myself clear enough. Any answer is helpful. Cheers.

Edit: all of this for a mobile pwa. Is one faster than the other? Does one make less requests to a database or something like that?

I'm learning Redux, that's why I'm trying to change in-component state to global state.  
Recently added task shows but only after the page refresh.
