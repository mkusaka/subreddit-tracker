We alternate between **Who's Hiring** (on the 1st of the month, [most recent one here][hiring:most recent]) and **Who's Available** (on the 15th, [most recent one here][available:most recent])

_I am sorry for the missing "Who's Available [Dec 2019]" üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_

Welcome to **the biggest React job board in the world!** This is like Hacker News' **Who's Hiring** but just for React. Top Level comments must be **Job Opportunities.**

‚ö†Ô∏è NEW: WE ARE REQUESTING EVERYBODY FOLLOW [THE HN Who's Hiring FORMAT][format:hiring:hn]

**Company inc. | Job Title | City/State Location | Full-time/Part-Time | On-site/Remote | (Optional) Salary range | Website jobs page, other hard requirements etc.**

examples:

- **Thorn | San Francisco or Remote (US based) | Full-time Contract | $100k - $150k | Software Engineer | https://www.wearethorn.org/**
- **PolicyStat | Full-Stack Python+Django Software Engineer | Indianapolis, Vancouver, or REMOTE | Full Time | +\$80k**

Please include as much information as possible. **If you are remote-friendly, or open to sponsoring work visas to your country, say so! These are the top 2 questions!**

If you are looking for jobs, send a PM to the poster or post in our [Who's Available thread!][available:most recent]

This is an example of the power of open-source, working together or building off of one another to  improve user experience for everyone: 

Marcy Sutton of Gatsby produced original research on  -  [client-side routing and accessibility](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/) 

Madalyn Parker took that research and [turned it into improvements in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-02-10-accessible-client-side-routing-improvements/)

Marcus Herrmann wrote about [improved accessible routing in Vue](https://marcus.io/blog/improved-accessible-routing-vuejs) and namechecked Marcy's research

And svelte has been inspired to [change their routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing/issues/25#issuecomment-576513320) based on Madalyn's work.

Hi all! So I created a component that "highlights" an element by darkening the whole page except for a circle around the given element. However, I can't seem to get the circle to be exactly centered on the element for some reason. Here's what I have:

https://jscomplete.com/playground/s397512

Does anybody have any recommendations for how I can make sure the circle is positioned correctly? Thanks.
