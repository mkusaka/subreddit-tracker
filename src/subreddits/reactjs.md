Is there any good cheat sheet on how to extend Material-UI? There are several ways on how to extend Material-UI, but a lot of them leave unmanageable bloat in the code and don't maximize code reuse, so I would like to see a list of anti-patterns and best practices.

Recently I came across a site called [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/components), it provides a huge library of UI components for React, Angular, Vue and React Native freely made available by the community. Bit is also provides a platform to share UI components among team members while doing a project. But this is where my knowledge about Bit ends.

Can anyone help me to use Bit in my project, I tried to find vdo tutorial in YouTube but failed. There are few tutorial showing how to create my own components and upload in the platform but those tutorials are also not very much clear and I couldn't find any tutorial showing how use the community made components to my project.

If anyone is able to provide me with a vdo tutorial then it will be very much helpful.
## [6][UI Design in SCSS or Styled Components (or any CSS-in-JS)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jp2iwa/ui_design_in_scss_or_styled_components_or_any/)

Hey all, 

I am working with moderately large React codebase which is turning into legacy now (or that's what I think)

I would like to get the whole app's design in sync with Designs and Designers are working on this part. Same is coming up for React App.

Now I would like the get the communities opinion on what to use? SCSS (with BEM) or CSS-in-JS?

We are using SCSS with BEM right now. But it has not been used properly and still there are some collisions of classes. Though I would say it is only ~2% (don't know how I am quoting this number. I just saw some of the collisions)

As it is already going in moderately good direction; I still think, BEM puts the responsibility of making collision free class names on developers.

And we have tools to avoid collision and not worry about the Class Names with CSS-in-JS.

Can someone point out their experiences on both CSS systems and what they prefer after working on both?

Hello, r/reactjs!

We are a small but proud development team of [uStudio Company](http://ustudio.company/) from the country of Ukraine.

Today we released our UI-Kit/Framework for React that uses `styled-components` ‚Äì [Brix UI](https://github.com/uStudioTeam/brix-ui)!. It includes several useful packages with a bunch of components and theming-related stuff.

This is a special moment for us and we would be really happy if this UI-Kit comes in handy for any other developers rather than us.

We tried to approach many problems that were a pain for us while using other ui-kits (such as material-ui) and introduced some concepts that we think are worthy for you to check out.

For now we only have a storybook documentation available, but in the close future we will make a full and descriptive documentation website. We plan on describing each and every concept we introduced as well as providing some guides/recipes.

Thank you for your attention, any feedback will be much appreciated!

I wanted to try authentication in react (MERN). I've been stuck on how to handle protected routes, redirecting users if they go to that route and going to dashboard after login. 

I would love to have your help/suggestions on this.

Any helpful tutorials or articles?

## [10][Is there any point in using a &lt;form&gt; if I handle the submission anyway?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jp39n6/is_there_any_point_in_using_a_form_if_i_handle/)

At the moment I have something like:
    
    &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;label for="name"&gt;Enter your name&lt;/label&gt;
       &lt;textarea id="name" rows="4" onChange={handleTextChanged}&gt;
       &lt;button onClick={handleSubmit}&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&amp;nbsp;

This work perfectly fine but I was wondering if I should be more semantically correct and use `&lt;form&gt;` instead? If I do then I also need to use `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the browser from submitting the form which isn't a big deal but it got me thinking that maybe using `&lt;form&gt;` in the first place in unnecessary. What do you guys think?
