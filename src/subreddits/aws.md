Is it possible to emulate AWS? How do you do it? I just want to post code that's going to work when deployed to AWS. To make sure it works, I need to test the application on an emulator. I don't want to use AWS, because it costs money. What are the alternatives?

Hi all,

I have a Wordpress instance up and running with a Wordpress site hosted, but I also need to host a few static HTML sites on it. Would that be doable at all, or would it make more sense to set up a new instance specifically for the static sites ?
## [4][AWS Amplify: How do I test REST API's and lambda template?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/frokdx/aws_amplify_how_do_i_test_rest_apis_and_lambda/)

I was playing around with Amplify CLI in an angular project. I wanted to create a REST API endpoint and connect it with Lambda and DynamoDB. I was successfully able to create the cloud resources but how do I get the API gateway payload for all the HTTP methods. I want to test and develop my lambdas against it. I know I can invoke functions for the amplify CLI but do not have the payload passed by API gateway. Do I have to deploy my functions and test the APIs with say, Postman. Then debug and deploy again? Because that will take a lot of deploys. And because the package of lambda is too large for web-IDE I have no option but to debug it in VSCode.

What am I missing here? I can create an API and Lambda and DynamoDB table but can't test it. If there are any resources on the internet you people can tell me I would be grateful.

I´m using Appstream 2.0 and want to create a streaming url to embed Appstream in my website. Atm i´m at step 2 of this guide:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/embed-streaming-sessions.html

To access the API of Appstream do i need to use Amazon API Gateway?

Hey all,  


I'm doing a blue-green deployment since php platform version 7.0 is retired. I'm running into the following error:   
`[proxy:error] [pid 4422] (2)No such file or directory: AH02454: FCGI: attempt to connect to Unix domain socket /run/php-fpm/www.sock (*) failed [proxy_fcgi:error] [pid 4422] [client x.x.x.x:32038] AH01079: failed to make connection to backend: httpd-UDS`

I'm not using php-fpm, its a wordpress env. So I ssh'd into the instance to check the php version. I noticed the version is still at 7.0 while I specified 7.3 in my beanstalk environment, which seems weird to me.  


Anyone has any experience with this?

## [9][How to interpret anomaly score AWS Sagemaker Random Cut Forest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/frkyq1/how_to_interpret_anomaly_score_aws_sagemaker/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/frkyq1/how_to_interpret_anomaly_score_aws_sagemaker/

Hi all,

I tried using AWS Sagemaker Random Cut Forest Model and built a anomaly detection model on my own dataset. Now, I am trying to interpret the anomaly scores. 

I followed the example given in [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-the-built-in-amazon-sagemaker-random-cut-forest-algorithm-for-anomaly-detection/).

In the post, it mentions that - 

&gt; common practice suggests that scores beyond three standard deviations from the mean score are considered anomalous


I understand the point, but isn't this only true if the data distribution is approximately normal? Does this mean that the anomaly scores computed by RCF for a given dataset will follow a normal distribution?

Why isn’t AWS bringing MongoDb on RDS? 
NoSQL is becoming popular these days but still why isn’t AWS bringing support for MongoDb?
