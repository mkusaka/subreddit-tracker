**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

Due to the Turing completeness of the C++ type system it is possible to implement a complete CPU emulator using only templates. The complete code is executed during compilation, the only run time code is for printing the output and registers.

[https://github.com/aul12/TemplateCpu](https://github.com/aul12/TemplateCpu)

At the moment not many instructions are supported, but new instructions can be added easily. With the current state it is already possible to calculate the n-th fibonacci number, both iterative and recursive.

## [12][C++20 specification of `std::reverse_iterator` makes creating a `std::string_view` from another `std::string_view`'s reverse iterators impossible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gup023/c20_specification_of_stdreverse_iterator_makes/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gup023/c20_specification_of_stdreverse_iterator_makes/
---
EDIT: See the very bottom of the post. This whole thing was nonsense.

Today I tried something like this\*:

    std::string_view original;
    std::string_view copy(original.begin(), original.end()); // (1)
    std::string_view reversed(original.rbegin(), original.rend()); // (2)

To my surprise this didn't compile at all. On further inspection, [`std::string_view` constructor](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view/basic_string_view) only got an overload that takes a begin iterator and an end sentinel in C++20. It is even constrained with C++20 concepts. The important part of the constraints:

&gt; - `It` satisfies `contiguous_iterator`, 

&amp;nbsp;

Cool. I do have gcc 10.1. However, this only makes line `(1)` compile. Line `(2)` errors, saying that a `random_access_iterator` isn't a `contiguous_iterator`.

Logically, if `T::iterator` is a `contiguous_iterator`, so must be `T::reverse_iterator`. Or so I thought.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's look at the specification of [`std::string_view`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view) itself.

&amp;nbsp;

`std::string_view::iterator` is the same as `std::string_view::const_iterator` for which cppreference says:

&gt; implementation-defined constant `LegacyRandomAccessIterator`, `ConstexprIterator` (since C++20) and `LegacyContiguousIterator` whose value_type is `CharT`

So we have confirmed that `std::string_view::iterator` models a contiguous iterator. What about `std::string_view::reverse_iterator`?

Once again it is the same as the `const_reverse_iterator` for which cppreference says the following:

&gt; `std::reverse_iterator&lt;const_iterator&gt;`

Is it possible that [`std::reverse_iterator&lt;It&gt;`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/reverse_iterator) never produces a contiguous iterator? Well.. here's what cppreference has to say about `std::reverse_iterator&lt;It&gt;::iterator_category`:

&gt; If `std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::iterator_category` models `std::derived_from&lt;std::random_access_iterator_tag&gt;`, this is `std::random_access_iterator_tag`. Otherwise, this is `std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::iterator_category` unchanged 

And for `iterator_concept`:

&gt; If `Iter` models `std::random_access_iterator`, this is `std::random_access_iterator_tag`. Otherwise, this is `std::bidirectional_iterator_tag`

So yes, having `std::string_view::reverse_iterator` specified as `std::reverse_iterator&lt;std::string_view::const_iterator&gt;` makes this iterator not viable for the new constructor overload.

Proof of the above: https://godbolt.org/z/QHRjsA

&amp;nbsp;

Final thoughts:

1. GCC/libstdc++ seems to have followed the standard to the letter, so there doesn't seem to be a bug to report.
2. `std::reverse_iterator` seems to have been intentionally designed to avoid ever producing a contiguous iterator. Does anyone know a rationale for this?
3. This really looks like an oversight in the specification to me.

&amp;nbsp;

\* The actual code I wanted to write is [here](https://godbolt.org/z/uL4UR5)

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Nothing to see here folks. I don't know what I was thinking. A `string_view` can't "magically" view a reverse buffer without allocating it too (or holding a stride as mentioned by /u/ramennoodle) and allocation would defeat the purpose of `string_view`.
