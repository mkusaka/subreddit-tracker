## [1][A Ruby Reference updated for Ruby 2.7](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ela6jc/a_ruby_reference_updated_for_ruby_27/)

**[Ruby Reference](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubyref/)** is intended to be most **full**, **actual** and **accessible** language reference. Most of the reference content is taken directly from Ruby documentation and reorganized for easier reading. The core docs were augmented with some quotes from the Ruby website, and some missing content that is written specifically for the book. The source of the book (rendering scripts, config, and unique content) is open and can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/tree/master/_src).

Today I am releasing the new version, which was fully re-rendered for Ruby 2.7 and also includes some content and style fixes. [Changelog](https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/blob/master/_src/CHANGELOG.md).

I hope somebody'll find this useful.

It's about making your RoR tests run much much faster.

I'm using a jekyll theme on Github that isn't built with a header image. After putting one in, it "floats" down as you scroll rather than remaining fixed in the header. I tried just entering "position: fixed;" which didn't work. Any suggestions? I'm EXTREMELY new to programming, like Level 0, so please keep it at an ELI5 level. Thanks for any help!

I am afraid I will forget everything I've learnt within a month as I'm learning coding as a hobby on the side. Hence want to find some place which will allow me to take Ruby tests/exams &amp; give me some projects to practice.
