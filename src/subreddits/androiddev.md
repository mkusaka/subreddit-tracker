* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

When viewing the screenshots for one of my apps via the Google Play app, the screenshots displayed are compressed and super low quality. When viewing the Play app store page via a desktop web browser, they look high res.

I've tried several suggestions, including: 
- Trying JPEG's and PNG's 
- Using images with lower dimensions and higher dimensions 
- Compressing the images myself to reduce their file size

None of these really make a difference, and Google still seems to compress them pretty heavily (i.e. if I compress them myself, Google just compresses them more to make them even worse). Thanks!

With SharedFlow the solution now seems to be complete, it's high time to get to know it better and maybe even start on using it in production.

**TL;DR** Can I post my complete mess of a WIP app to the play store for internal testers only, or will Google rain fire from above?

I'm writing an application that is currently internal only, but will eventually\~ (you know, maybe) be high enough quality to publish to the world. I want to publish it on the play store on an internal track so I can push updates out to devices in my household as I iterate and add features.

Currently it's hard-coded to point to a service on my internal network, and has mismatched logos (name is one thing, logo says another thing) and is generally just in a sorry state for anyone else to use.

Is the play store ok with this? Will it be scrutinized on the internal track and be removed from the play store etc. because it's clearly not functional outside of my household? Have others done this?

Just a little concerned due to the amount of details it wants me to fill out to publish anything, and I don't really want a Google employee testing the application like they would a public app.

 First, I have to choose between java , kotlin &amp; flutter . I choose flutter and started leaning dart. Then I made some small projects like todo app and alarm clocks. After learning flutter for a bit(1 month) I challenged myself to make an app in just 3 days. I tried my best on those 3 days. Please give me your options on this app which was made within 3 days by a beginner. The result is below-:

Play store:[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aniket.randomize](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aniket.randomize)

Source code: [https://github.com/AniketSindhu/randomize](https://github.com/AniketSindhu/randomize) 

An app with hell lot of options like:-

âœ…Random number\*(any range)\*  
âœ…Dice Roll\*(up to 6 dice at the same time)\*  
âœ…Coin flip\*(5 different coins to flip)\*  
âœ…A random card from a deck  
âœ…Yes/no\*(ask yourself a question)\*  
âœ…Password generator  
âœ…Custom roulette\*(roll with 6 different objects)\*  
âœ…Random color\*(find a beautiful color scheme)\*  
âœ…Random letter  
âœ…Random date\*(fix your appointments)\*  
âœ…Random fact\*(increase your knowledge)\*  
âœ…Random quote\*(be motivated)\*  
âœ…Random name generator\*(male/female)\*  
âœ…Random location\*(on map)\*  
âœ…Random movie\*(Hollywood/Bollywood)\*  
âœ…Random country\*(plan your next international travel trip)\*  
âœ…Random video game\*(get what to play next)\*

**Luck is not as random as you think.**  
**Before that lottery ticket won the jackpot, someone had to buy it ðŸ˜‰.**
