We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I am able to console.log and view an array of objects. I am also able to access a seperate element of the array. But when i try to access a property, i get an error saying property undefined. How do i solve this?

&amp;#x200B;

       console.log(familyMembers);
       const [fields, setFields] = useState(familyMembers);

This is what im trying to do. familyMembers is an array of objects from mongoDB.

But fields is always empty.

&amp;#x200B;

     const {  name, address, phone, email, familyMembers } = state;
    
        useEffect(() =&gt; {
            axios
                .get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API}/post/${props.match.params.id}`)
                .then(response =&gt; {
                    const { name, phone, email, address, familyMembers } = response.data;
                    setState({ ...state, name, phone, email, address, familyMembers })
                })
                .catch(error =&gt; alert('Error loading single post'));
                
        }, []
        );

I get this when I console.log familyMembers:

    (3)Â [{â€¦}, {â€¦}, {â€¦}]

const number = movies.map((movie) =&gt; movie.price);  
 const sum = number.reduce(function(a, b) {  
 return a + b;  
 }, 0);

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 inputs one for the movie name and other for the price I'm trying to get the total price on the nav... I get the total price but when a add something it doubles the total number

this is the  exercise I'm studying from

Frontend is not my strongest suite, I've seen mostly the backend dude when working on projects. The most I've used is bootstrap and materialize.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some popular libraries that are used along with react for beautiful design and mobile responsive?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

 Hello everyone, i'm having few problems using node.js, i've done this procedure:

* Download Node LTS
* In the bash shell i wrote " npm install -g create-react-app "
* Then i've moved to a project directory that i've called "node" and i made the app writing " create-react-app myapp"
* So far no errors, then i've moved to the project directory and wrote "npm start", and this was the resut: [LINK](https://i.imgur.com/0hYSmOc.png)

How can i fix this? I've already tried to delete package.JSON and node\_modules and reinstall them with "npm install" without any success.

Also two users on r/node told me to use " npx create-react-app myapp " instead of " npm install -g create-react-app", i've executed " npm uninstall -g create-react-app " before that and i still have the samae error.

Thanks!
## [12][Help with flexbox/css styling](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g3lhyb/help_with_flexboxcss_styling/)

My temp website is here: https://gm-stats.netlify.app/



Now the two problems are...

1) There is an unwanted gap between the 1st and 2nd row when the flexbox is in a 5 x 2 formation. I only want the gap between the two rows to be 10px but I can't figure out why it keeps generating a large gap in the middle, when I inspect it the margins look small.


2) When I zoom in or shrink the page and more than 2 rows are created the cards flow off the page and the background image won't cover everything. How do I ensure that the background image is always stretching to cover the entire view?


I apologize if these are pretty basic questions but I'm having a hard time trying to figure this out and would appreciate any help.
