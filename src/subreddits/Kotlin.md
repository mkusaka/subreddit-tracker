Hi all, the quick question is as the title says :) 

A bit more of context: 

I am planning on using Ktor for implementing a REST API to be consumed from a mobile native app, I may some basic web functionality, but the main project ia the REST API.

i did a quick search, and the obvious options are Heroku and Google Engine.

I also read that there is a way of deploying into AWS Lambda functions.

I expect to host some database (not necessarily SQL) and some static content (images and so on) but not much user generated content, so as today I won't have a big need on space/storage.

I am a developer, with some little knowledge of devops, and I would rather keep that way :) (do not want to periodically spend hours a week configuring or maintaining a server infrastructure) 

Can you share your scenarios? What type of app do you run, where do you host? how cheap/expensive is? And would you recommend it? 

It will be appreciated :) 

Thanks!

I did some coding for IOS on and off for about 3 years and I got to a decent stage where I didn't know everything off the top of my head but I was able to read docs and know what I needed to implement. I kinda got bored and stopped developing for IOS moved to web dev for like 3 months and I decided to give android dev a try, since I have an Android phone now. First app was just a tap counter app seems very simple drop a couple textViews and a button. Now connect them..... OK wtf how do I do that? I've searched the web for a while saw that you need to add a onClickListener ok cool.... I honestly have no idea wtf I'm doing this is more of a rant since i had to endure 30 mins of this clown in 2 minute segments [https://www.raywenderlich.com/4936497-your-first-kotlin-android-app/lessons/17](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4936497-your-first-kotlin-android-app/lessons/17) .... I can't take it anymore IOS was a lot simpler but i really want to learn Kotlin and get into Adroid Dev. Does anyone know of any good text based resources since I personally don't care for videos. Thanks and sorry for my rant its tough.

Hello everyone,

Your average college student here, currently learning computer programming. We have this course where we have to learn a programming language by ourselves. I personally loved android app development when introduced to me during my program, I want to learn kotlin for the same reason, most students are learning python which is super popular in our newbie's eyes. I have already been trying to develop in java for a while. But the dilemma I am facing right now is if I choose kotlin would I totally suck, I don't want to fail this course. If I choose python, I would be able to ask my classmates and friends for help and it would be fairly less stressful. But, I don't really know anyone who knows kotlin, so kinda anxious about choosing it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I want to study kotlin as part of my college course but I'm too scared to suck at it and fail the course. I also have an option to study python which is comparatively easy and know people personally who are really into it that I can count on for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for all recommendations/advices to my dilemma caused by overthinking, have a good day.
