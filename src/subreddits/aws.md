AWS always releases a bunch of features, sometimes everyday or atleast once a week. Here is my wish list of the features I want to see as a part of AWS infrastructure

1: AWS Managed Proxy Server(Rather than spinning own squid server)

2: EBS replication across different availability zones(Possible? Legal constraints?)

3: Multi-region VPC(Possible? Legal constraints?)

4: UI to debug boot issues(Better then EC2 Get Instance Screenshot and Instance logs)

5: Support tagging for every individual service(It's improving)

6: VPC endpoints support for every service (EKS?) 

7: EC2 instance live migration

8: Display AWS Cli  while resource creation(Similar to GCP)

9: Cost calculation while resource creation(AWS start supporting(for example, RDS) this feature but not for every service

10: More features in App Mesh(Circuit breaker, Rate Limiting)

P.S: Not sure if some features are already available, but if something is missing, please feel free to add

Doing this for a few reasons. We know some folks are hesitant to create a new post for a small question they may have. Well, this is the place to ask, and discuss. At the same time, with a growing community we find ourselves having to limit the posts that may be off-topic to the primary purpose of the sub.

[In this blog](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-resources-and-autoscaling-from-basics-to-greatness-7cae17fbf27b?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ea2b30df277edaf345dc4868a63ef29b), we will try to describe the building blocks that are used by Kubernetes to implement autoscaling. We will see how Kubernetes collects and use metrics to autoscale pods and nodes. We will use AWS EKS to demonstrate the patterns and best practices used to implement autoscaling both at the pod and node levels.

I've been searching git repos and I've noticed most people don't commit their file. Which sorta makes sense to me because I can see how it might contain sensitive info. How then do people add config files to their different environments?  


The context of the messages is I don't know what I'm doing, but am trying to figure it out and have written my first lambda project in c#.

Any feedback is much appreciated about my side project: [https://www.customizecognito.com/](https://www.customizecognito.com/)  It can be used to help prototype some styling of the hosted UI.

We had a designer that wanted to style the hosted-ui.  

&amp;#x200B;

Future features may include saving multiple mockups/prototypes and easily sharing the configurations.

Hello, sorry if this is too generic, but we are building an app with a Dev partner but this is his first time using AWS and we are having troubles figuring out possible cost of server. Our app is a marketplace so  there will be images and videos from the merchants, lots of comments and chats between merchants and customers, customers may also upload images and videos, we will be running an article aggregator, and we will also be running a couple algorithms and possibly machine learning. How much is a rough estimate of our monthly cost for say 500, 1000, and 10k MAU?

Many thanks!
