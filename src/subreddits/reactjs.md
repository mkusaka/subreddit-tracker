We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey, i have a question,  right now i'm following a front end track using react

and my main final goal is MERN stack,

and i've done many react tutorials and already finished some projects (only front end)

should i just focus on react and frontend in general and apply for frontend jobs now and learn the backend with node while i'm working

or just get into node now and finish some full stack projects and apply for a MERN full stack jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks :)

Hope this isn't breaking any rules, I've been working with React for a while but just started trying to become a part of the community. 

I was wondering if there are people that tweet about related stuff that I can follow or if there are any other places where React developers talk (other than this sub, of course).

Hello Everyone,

I am an Angular developer and started to learn the React and I have started with a very small piece of code to display the information from the API and I am successfully able to get the What I wished.

But since I have just started and there are many experienced folks out there, Can you please suggest to me If I need to improve something here.

My Objective is very simple there is an API that returns the Array of users and I wanted to iterate over it and display in the HTML.

What I need help is

1. Should I use state inside constructor are there any disadvantages over it, is there anything I can improve here
2. Where should I fetch the API, is `componentDidMount`  is the best place to invoke the API
3. Is there any chance that I can improve the performance of my page-load in the below code

Thanks in advance all the experts out there :)

    import React from 'react';
    
    interface IUser {
      userId: number;
      id: number;
      title: string;
      completed: boolean;
    }
    
    export default class Comments extends React.Component&lt;{}, { users: IUser[] }&gt; {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          users: [],
        };
      }
    
      componentDidMount() {
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
          .then((response) =&gt; response.json())
          .then((users: IUser[]) =&gt; this.setState({ users }));
      }
    
      render() {
        const { users } = this.state;
        return (
          &lt;div&gt;
            {users.map((user) =&gt; (
              &lt;div key={user.id}&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;{user.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            ))}
          &lt;/div&gt;
        );
      }
    }

Hi /r/reactjs, I hope this is the right place for this. 

I have got a job technical test next week and would like to get some practice in first.

Can anybody suggest some practice tests I can complete in the mean time?

It is for a senior role so ideally tests that focus on the advanced aspects.

Thanks in advance.

## [11][What is your approach to a dark theme toggler?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g88yan/what_is_your_approach_to_a_dark_theme_toggler/)

I know of 3 ways, css variables, conditional classes in components and with a framework like styled components. Not sure which one to choose. I feel like css variables would allow me to write less code because it takes one action to toggle everything, instead of checking for theme in every component.
