C++ and C# are the go to languages but I was wondering if Golang can compete?

Hi. I'm writing an app for a banking/investment company using Golang. I need a nice UI for employees to use and I found Lorca. The issue is, the company's work pcs don't have chrome installed, which Lorca uses. The work pcs do, however, have edge chromium.  


My question: Does Lorca work with edge chromium or should I use something else like WebView?

Also does WebView require anything to be installed in order to work?

Thanks

Does anyone have any good terminal UI libraries that they could recommend? I'm looking to add a UI to one of my command line programs but I don't want something too complicated. Any suggestions?
