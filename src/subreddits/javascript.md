I was curious if anyone actually liked Javascript over Typescript, but the threads I found tended to be from 2 years ago and codebases change very quickly, so I'm asking this again to see if there's an update.

I can't imagine writing anything remotely complex without types. Even small, independent projects feel like a hassle (the only place where pure js seems to shine for me), since writing code on my own feels like writing with a team of past and future versions of myself, all of whom still suck.

Anyway, is there still anyone who likes Javascript over Typescript in 2020, if so, why, and otherwise, why hasn't typescript become the norm already?

I'm trying to improve my coding skills. Messiness is one of my main problems (in real life and while coding). These are some articles that helped me shift to writing clean code. I'm looking for more great resources, tips, articles, or books that would help even more. Does anyone know more resources I could add to my list? If so, please mention it in the comments, and I will add it to to the list.

Can you suggest a platform or marketplace useful to find developers in Russia (Saint Petersburg)? 

I'm looking for a full stack developer to work on completing a web app - music sketchpad for musicians.

Thanks for your help.
