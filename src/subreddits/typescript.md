Foal TS framework version 1.9 is officially released!

[Foal TS - June release \(version 1.9\)](https://preview.redd.it/cbw3ao9078451.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1281bba1a03e446043f4cc901173ea9cf6a4016)

This version brings many improvements and fixes bugs.

1. **MongoDB can now be fully used with TypeORM**. The new `fetchMongoDBUser` allows you to retrieve the MongoDB user whether you use sessions or stateless JWTs.

Foal, in a few words, it's a **Node.js framework**:

* written in **TypeScript**
* provided **with batteries included** (Auth, OpenAPI, GraphQL, ORM, CLI, scripts, Cloud file storage, etc)
* and with a **simple and intuitive architecture** (no magic, no over-engineering).

And the must: it has more than 11,000 lines of documentation.

## [4][Passing generic to function without calling it (1st class function)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h0qrqx/passing_generic_to_function_without_calling_it/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h0qrqx/passing_generic_to_function_without_calling_it/

I'm trying to pass a 1st class function to a another function while have the generic inferred without calling it, but I can't get typescript to infer the type, only if I explicitly call the function.

    sql.parseTable = &lt;T&gt;(res: QueryResult): T[] =&gt;
        pipe(sqlResRows, map(convertToCamelCase))(res)
    
    const songs = await sql.query({
        sql: SELECT_SONGS,
        parse: sql.parseTable, // in this line the generic can't be inferred
        parse: res =&gt; sql.parseTable(res), // the generic correctly inferred
    })

I would prefer the first one as it's cleaner and would mean i don't have to change all my graphql resolvers, but the generic can't be inferred.

Any ideas?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h0e3ff/help_with_tsmongoose/

The code:

The main file:

`server.ts`

    import * as Fastify from "fastify";
    import * as Dotenv from "dotenv";
    import * as mongoose from "mongoose";
    import routes from "./routes";
    import fastify = require("fastify");
    
    Dotenv.config();
    
    const server = Fastify({ logger: true });
    
    server.register(routes);
    
    const connectToMongo = async (): Promise&lt;void&gt; =&gt; {
      try {
        await mongoose.connect(String(process.env.MONGODB_URI), {
          useNewUrlParser: true,
          useUnifiedTopology: true,
          useCreateIndex: true,
        });
      } catch (err) {
        throw err;
      }
    };
    
    const startServer = async (): Promise&lt;void&gt; =&gt; {
      try {
        await server.listen(Number(process.env.PORT), process.env.ADDR);
        server.log.info(`Started Server @ ${process.env.ADDR}:${process.env.PORT}`);
        await connectToMongo();
        server.log.info("Connected to Mongo...");
      } catch (err) {
        server.log.error(err);
        process.exit(-1);
      }
    };
    
    startServer();

A sample schema:

`schema/task.ts`

    import { createSchema, Type, typedModel } from "ts-mongoose";
    
    const taskSchema = createSchema(
      {
        entryDate: Type.date({ required: true }),
        particulars: Type.string({ required: true }),
        finishDate: Type.date({ required: false }),
      },
      { collection: "Task", timestamps: true }
    );
    
    export default taskSchema;

Models:

`models.ts`

    import { typedModel } from "ts-mongoose";
    import aggregateSchema from "./schemata/aggregate";
    import taskSchema from "./schemata/task";
    import transactionSchema from "./schemata/transaction";
    
    const models = {
      Aggregate: typedModel("Aggregate", aggregateSchema),
      Task: typedModel("Task", taskSchema),
      Transaction: typedModel("Transaction", transactionSchema),
    };
    
    export default models;

Routes file (WIP):

`route.ts`

    import * as Fastify from "fastify";
    import { Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from "http";
    import handlers from "./handlers";
    
    const routes = (
      server: Fastify.FastifyInstance&lt;Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse&gt;,
      opts: Fastify.RegisterOptions&lt;Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse&gt;,
      done: (err?: Fastify.FastifyError | undefined) =&gt; void
    ): void =&gt; {
      server.get("/transaction", opts, handlers.getTransactionHandler);
    
      server.post("/transaction", opts, async (req, res) =&gt; {});
    
      server.get("/aggregate", opts, async () =&gt; {});
    
      server.get("/task", opts, async () =&gt; {});
      server.post("/task", opts, async () =&gt; {});
      server.put("/task/:id", opts, async () =&gt; {});
    
      done();
    };
    
    export default routes;

Handlers file (WIP):

`handlers.ts`

    import { FastifyRequest, FastifyReply } from "fastify";
    import { ServerResponse } from "http";
    
    import models from "./models";
    const { Aggregate, Task, Transaction } = models;
    
    const handlers = {
      getTransactionHandler: async (
        req: FastifyRequest,
        _: FastifyReply&lt;ServerResponse&gt;
      ) =&gt; {
        const x = new Task({ entryDate: Date() });
        await x.save();
        return "Hello";
      },
    };
    
    export default handlers;

In `handlers.ts`, when I instantiate a `Task` object without one of the required properties, no error is thrown at compile time. Error is thrown at runtime. Also, intellisense/autocomplete of VS Code does not work with the property names. Is that expected behaviour? I expected almost class-like typechecking behaviour, like when we instantiate a new object using constructor.

    // works
    const configData = this.steps.reduce((accumulator: Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;,
     currentStepInstance: WizardSteps): Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt; =&gt; {...}, {});
    
    return configData as ConfigData;
       
    
    // doesn't work
    const configData: ConfigData = this.steps.reduce((accumulator: Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;, 
    currentStepInstance: WizardSteps): Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt; =&gt; {...}, {});
    
    return configData;
    
    
    // doesn't work
    const configData as ConfigData = this.steps.reduce((accumulator: Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;, 
    currentStepInstance: WizardSteps): Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt; =&gt; {...}, {});
    
    return configData;
    
    
    // doesn't work
    const configData&lt;ConfigData&gt; = this.steps.reduce((accumulator: Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;, 
    currentStepInstance: WizardSteps): Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt; =&gt; {...}, {});
    
    return configData;

My understanding of type assertions is not complete.

I initially thought the 2nd version should work, but the error message made sense, it looks like `reduce` will be returning a Partial of the type with no explicit acknowledgement that all k/v pairs will be there.

Ok, so a type assertion should work. But both `as` and `&lt;&gt;` syntax have failed and I don't understand why.

Only the first example worked where the type was initially allowed to be inferred, only being asserted later as the object is returned. Personally I don't like that, I want to be explicit earlier on if possible.

Thanks for any feedback on this.

My understanding is that most charting libraries rely on traditional style rules, so wouldn't play well with TypeStyle (or styled-components) - is that accurate? If so, what recommendations do people have?

Pnpm is a package manager that uses symlinks for node modules. Yesterday I started learning typescript but the code doesn't runs with pnpm. Using the npm instead of pnpm works. I stumbled upon few stackoverflow and github questions but none had the answer.
## [11][Help with return values out of `reduce` method](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h06rlf/help_with_return_values_out_of_reduce_method/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h06rlf/help_with_return_values_out_of_reduce_method/
---
I have an interface `ConfigData` that identifies a couple of key/value pairs (`languageCode: string`, and `numberOfRepeats: number`).

Not every step object being reduced will contribute to the accumulator. Of 5 steps passing through, only 2 will add a k/v pair.

I want `const configData` in the example below to receive a `ConfigData` object after the reduce method evaluates. But my code is incorrect as is in (at least) two places:

       run(): ConfigData {
    
          const configData = this.steps.reduce((accumulator: Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;, currentStep: WizardSteps): ConfigData =&gt; {
             // instruct and ask for feedback
             currentStep.explain();
             const rawUserResponse: string = currentStep.prompt();
    
             if (currentStep.needsInputValidation) {
                const validatedInput: string = currentStep.validate(rawUserResponse);
                
                return {
                   [currentStep.configDataKey] : validatedInput
    // const validatedInput: string
    // Type '{ [x: string]: string; }' is missing the following 
    // properties from type 'ConfigData': languageCode, 
    // numberOfRepeats ts(2739)
                };
             }
    
             if (currentStep.needsFileValidation) {
                // blocks until file is validated
                currentStep.validate();
             }
    
    
          }, {});
    
          return configData;
    // const configData: Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;
    // Type 'Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;' is not assignable to type 'ConfigData'.
    // Property 'languageCode' is optional in type 'Partial&lt;ConfigData&gt;' 
    // but required in type 'ConfigData'. ts(2322)
       }

I'm having a hard time with both of these. The second one is at least comprehensible but I'm lost on how to fix both. Anyone know how?
