## [2][I could use some help with properly typing an event emitter function](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j3s87i/i_could_use_some_help_with_properly_typing_an/)

I have a use case for an event emitter like API, but I can't seem to properly type one of the functions.

I have this interface

```
interface EventChannel&lt;API extends {}&gt; {
  emit: (eventName: keyof API, payload: API[typeof eventName]) =&gt; void
}
```

However, that doesn't feel right, because we get into this sort of situation

```
interface ExampleInterface {
  onNumber: number;
  onString: string;
}

type MyInterface = EventChannel&lt;ExampleInterface&gt;;
```

And now when you look at `MyInterface.emit`, the `eventName` is correct, but the payload is `number | string`, which isn't entirely correct.

Is there a way to make it so that the type of the payload matches the type expected by `ExampleInterface[eventName]`?

Here's my challenge (I've simplified it a little). I have a class call `TestClient` which I use for writing integration tests. There are two kinds of users who can access my application, web users (standard humans who log in) and service users (machine-to-machine users who access with an API key). These users have different structures


    interface WebUserIdentity {
       userId: string
       emails: string[]
       type: 'Web'
    }

and 


    interface ServiceUserIdentity {
       authorizedOrganization: string
       createdByUserId: string
       type: 'Service'
    }


What I want to be able to do is have code in my `TestClient` that can do something depending on what type of user I have.



	class TestClient&lt;IdentityType&gt; {
		private identity: IdentityType;

		public addEmailForUser(emailAddress: string, optionationUserId?: string){
			 let userId;

			 if(this.identity.type === Web){
				 userId = this.identity.userId;
			 }else{
				 // assume there's error checking in here.
				  userId = optionationUserId;
			 }


			 const newEmail = addTheEmailToTheSystem(emailAddress, userId);
			 if(this.identity.type === Web){
				 this.identity.emails.push(newEmail);
			 }
		}
	}

This way when I'm writing a test I can have something like this


    const webTestClient: TestClient&lt;WebUserIdentity&gt;
    webTestClient.addEmail('a@b.com');


My problem is in the generic for `TestClient&lt;IdentityType&gt;`. I'm pretty sure I'll need conditional types but I can't get it to work so that once I confirm the type I can access the appropriate properties.
## [4][Need ideas for a 30 minutes workshop on Typescript](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j349k2/need_ideas_for_a_30_minutes_workshop_on_typescript/)

So, I started convincing my team (all JS devs) to make the switch to Typescript, and the CTO of my company told me to make a 30 minutes workshop to teach them about typescript and SHOW how it could benefit our company. 

We have a front end in React and React-Native and a back-end in Node, so to me the advantage is obvious, but I feel that some people still needs a bit of convincing.

So this workshop needs both to be an introduction to TS as well as a showcase of how powerful it can be, any ideas of how I could/should do it? 

P.S.: I don't have any experience making workshops either, so any tips could help, really.

I've been looking at the [various runtime type &amp; validation libs](https://github.com/moltar/typescript-runtime-type-benchmarks) and I'm generally impressed by what they do, but the dependence on function objects to represent types was driving me crazy, so I set out to create the same effect without them.

It was surprisingly challenging to coax the type inference engine to do what I wanted, and IMHO the results are amazing and I'm super stoked about it.

Unfortunately I simply could not avoid using functions to build structures, but for singular types the proxies are just the name of the type!

If there's any interest I will try to roll it into a library.

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j33067/help_restricting_a_mapped_type_to_a_list_of/
---
so hard to explain here (or to google) exactly what I'm looking for. I want to 

1. have a single source of possible events (either as a union of strings, or keys in an interface)
2. then use that list to build new types where I get hints from that list of possible events

Let's imagine some fake DOM events:


    interface DomEvents {
        'click': DomClickEvent;
        'keydown': DomKeyDownEvent;
    }

then I want to use these events (click, keydown) in another type while getting autocompletions and I don't know how to do that.

I want to do something like this (type a type), but it's obviously impossible:

    type DomEventMap: {[K in keyof DomEvents]: () =&gt; void} = {
         // get autocomplete here for the props (click, keydown)
    }

I'm sure I'm spacing out on something I've seen before, but I can't find a good example of this anywhere

I have a base type (ex: Record&lt;string, any&gt;) that I want to ensure is true for all sub-type instances. For each sub-type, I have a set of specific keys which will be valid which return a specific set of values.

For example: type MyType extends Record&lt;string, any&gt; = { a: string, b: number }

I am looking for a way to get the type "a" | "b" from MyType. However, using "keyof MyType" == "string | number".

What is the right way to extract only ("a" | "b") into a type of its own, given MyType as the input?

I created a FULLY TYPED Twitter API Client for Node.js ðŸ”§  
This client is taking full advantage of modern TypeScript capabilites!

âœ… **Fully typed!** Both for query parameters and responses.  
âœ… Includes 90% of the **official Twitter API** endpoints.  
âœ… **Promise-based!** No ugly callbacks.  
âœ… Inbuilt in-memory **cache** for rate-limit friendly usage.

Check it out ðŸ‘‡

It's by far my most common use of !. In strict mode all Env variables have an implicit type of `string | undefined`.

Just curious if you guys also use ! with them. Or if you do something else such as asserting `process.env` as `any`
