Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.\n\nFor what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.\n\n*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.

something awesome, and I think other people would want to do it as well - I've 100% disabled CloudWatch logging for all my Lambda functions (using a \"logs:*\" DENY policy) while still being able to have all logs that are needed when debugging with 0 costs.\n\nPre-requisites:\n- Sentry (either hosted or on-premise)\n- a basic understanding of the \"logging\" library in Python\n\nReasons to do this:\n- as mentioned in my other post (https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/g3k1zr/lambda_logs_to_anything_else_but_cloudwatch/), I had shitload of costs triggered by CloudWatch PutEvents that were killing my AWS budget\n- I hate scrolling through the new CloudWatch Web UI\n- I'm not interested in paying for another service (eg custom ElasticSearch/Datadog) to query/filter my logs\n\n\nHow to do it:\n- create your projects in Sentry and get a DSN (preferrably one for each of your Lambda repositories)\n- include the Sentry SDK in your custom Layer\n- and then:\n\n```\nfrom sentry import capture_exception\nfrom sentry import capture_message\nimport logging\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n  log = logging.getLogger(\"my-logger\")\n  log.debug(\"Hello, world\")\n  capture_message(\"something happened\")\n\n```\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nNow, when an exception is triggered through Sentry, you also get the benefit of having all the logs up until that point, WITHOUT

other people would want to do it as well - I&amp;#39;ve 100% disabled CloudWatch logging for all my Lambda functions (using a &amp;quot;logs:*&amp;quot; DENY policy) while still being able to have all logs that are needed when debugging with 0 costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-requisites:\n- Sentry (either hosted or on-premise)\n- a basic understanding of the &amp;quot;logging&amp;quot; library in Python&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reasons to do this:\n- as mentioned in my other post (&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/g3k1zr/lambda_logs_to_anything_else_but_cloudwatch/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/g3k1zr/lambda_logs_to_anything_else_but_cloudwatch/&lt;/a&gt;), I had shitload of costs triggered by CloudWatch PutEvents that were killing my AWS budget\n- I hate scrolling through the new CloudWatch Web UI\n- I&amp;#39;m not interested in paying for another service (eg custom ElasticSearch/Datadog) to query/filter my logs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to do it:\n- create your projects in Sentry and get a DSN (preferrably one for each of your Lambda repositories)\n- include the Sentry SDK in your custom Layer\n- and then:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;```\nfrom sentry import capture_exception\nfrom sentry import capture_message\nimport logging&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;def lambda_handler(event, context):\n  log = logging.getLogger(&amp;quot;my-logger&amp;quot;)\n  log.debug(&amp;quot;Hello, world&amp;quot;)\n  capture_message(&amp;quot;something happened&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, when an exception is triggered through Sentry, you also get the benefit of having all the logs up until that point, WITHOUT them being stored or even sent to CloudWatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof -&amp;gt; &lt;a
