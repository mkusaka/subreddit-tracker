Hey, I want to contribute to open-source but I'm not sure where to start, does anyone know a good repo for beginners that uses either React or Node?

I've found some but most of them either have very few issues or some issues that require a really big knowledge on their codebase.

Thanks in advance :)

So I see a lot of hype for ssr and nextjs these days, and I was thinking of learning it, but after some research I actually think it is not worth it. It is such a small element of oridinary web development life, I think just learning plain React SSR will be more beneficial. Also google updated chromium last year to latest version to support latest JS indexing, so SEO is not that big of a deal. So, unless you are creating a blog or bad network app, should you bother to invest time in NextJS and SSR?

So i’ve been looking all over Reddit, Google and even Fiverr to pay someone to do this for me. Basically, I want to write a script for a mobile game called “King of Thieves” which is centered around stealing gems from peoples bases which you find in matchmaking. These gems come in different tiers the highest being a golden color. I’m trying to make a script that will skip  bases repeatedly if the specific gold gem isn’t found on screen and if it is, it will alert me. So far i’ve only got my script to press the skip button once :(
