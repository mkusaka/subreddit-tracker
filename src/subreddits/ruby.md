My brother is looking to get in to programming and has a work problem he wants to use as his first project. I’ve agreed to work on it with him so we can learn together.

The problem is that at his work, making the rota for the week can take over half a day, as everyone’s needs must be aligned in a way that works for each employee. The idea would be to automate this process with a (hopefully) simple program. As the company is small and shift based this doesn’t seem overly complicated.

The plan would be to: 
1) implement it in a way that all data is collected and input in to a script that spits out a rota option that is then manually put in to a rota 

2) as my brother has an interest in app development, eventually he wants to create an app that can be used by an employee to send in their availability remotely. Once everyone has done this, the rota could then be created and sent out automatically.

I have a decent beginner-intermediate understanding of both Ruby and Python and feel one of these would be most suitable to the first stage  of the problem. I also use Ruby for my job and am doing a Udemy course on it as part of my day to day work. I am leaning more towards approaching the problem with Ruby for this reason as I’ve heard learning multiple languages at once before one is known well can be confusing.

My main concerns are:
- is Ruby the right language to be approaching the problem? Would python (or a different language) be more suitable?
- will Ruby be a good tool for my brother to continue on with future projects related to app development?

Hello good people, so Im interested in a remote work. Main reason is that now Im quite old and I have a kid, and I want/need to be at home more :)   
So I raised this goal for myself - to build some new skill in a year and after that start working on building my freelancer career based on that skill.   
Currently Im considering PHP and Laravel, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Python and Django. What I want from this community is to share how job market is, is my goal actually achievable? Is Rails a good choice now, especially when so many people say that Ruby is dying language...   
My background is a sys admin. And I think I can consider myself a coder, but not a real programmer yet. And I really want to become a proper programmer. And Ruby looks like a really interesting, different language to learn.

I just started using Ruby2d, and for the first couple of times that i started the file with vscode, it was around 0.300 seconds. I modified some code, and now suddenly it takes 104.646 seconds to start the program. I reversed the changes i did and now it still takes so long. Any reason for this or fixes?

Restarting works but it happens again couple of minutes after restarting and really no one is up to restart their pc every 5 minutes

Hello /r/ruby,

I am a basic data analyst who mostly plays around in R and Excel with some Python sprinkled in for browser automation. I wanted to try a language that was close in syntax to Python but different, as I'm not a fan of the python development environments.

I cam across Ruby and tried the little tutorial in the sidebar and found it fun. My question is: What are the benefits and strengths of using the Ruby language? What can I do with it that I cannot do with Python?

I hope this doesn't come across as adversarial or aggressive, I like the language but I want to use it for what it is good for, and learn it by playing to those strengths.

Thank you

Edit: Thank you for all the responses. It sounds like ruby is definitely worth learning. I bet you'll be seeing me around here relatively soon. :)
