Anyone have any experience with image classification in ruby?

I want to add it Image classification to an existing rails app but i’m not sure if i should just make a micro service in a different language or is there a good solution in ruby?

I'm working on a 4 years old app that is pretty slow.  
The sql queries are not the issue, I have identified the lack of eager loading and an old gem as the main issues, but is there a way to detect what else slows the app?

do you love ruby.


i am half tech/dev and half sales/marketing, looking to team with another dev. please send me a pm if interested to discuss more. 

NB, this is an "after work hours" side hustle (At least initially).

its for those that have entrepreneurial spirit, or want to team with others, and a focus on financial freedom. there are no paved roads, but risk and rewards go together. 

i will crosspost to r/startup later if appropriate.

My brother is looking to get in to programming and has a work problem he wants to use as his first project. I’ve agreed to work on it with him so we can learn together.

The problem is that at his work, making the rota for the week can take over half a day, as everyone’s needs must be aligned in a way that works for each employee. The idea would be to automate this process with a (hopefully) simple program. As the company is small and shift based this doesn’t seem overly complicated.

The plan would be to: 
1) implement it in a way that all data is collected and input in to a script that spits out a rota option that is then manually put in to a rota 

2) as my brother has an interest in app development, eventually he wants to create an app that can be used by an employee to send in their availability remotely. Once everyone has done this, the rota could then be created and sent out automatically.

I have a decent beginner-intermediate understanding of both Ruby and Python and feel one of these would be most suitable to the first stage  of the problem. I also use Ruby for my job and am doing a Udemy course on it as part of my day to day work. I am leaning more towards approaching the problem with Ruby for this reason as I’ve heard learning multiple languages at once before one is known well can be confusing.

My main concerns are:
- is Ruby the right language to be approaching the problem? Would python (or a different language) be more suitable?
- will Ruby be a good tool for my brother to continue on with future projects related to app development?

Hello good people, so Im interested in a remote work. Main reason is that now Im quite old and I have a kid, and I want/need to be at home more :)   
So I raised this goal for myself - to build some new skill in a year and after that start working on building my freelancer career based on that skill.   
Currently Im considering PHP and Laravel, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Python and Django. What I want from this community is to share how job market is, is my goal actually achievable? Is Rails a good choice now, especially when so many people say that Ruby is dying language...   
My background is a sys admin. And I think I can consider myself a coder, but not a real programmer yet. And I really want to become a proper programmer. And Ruby looks like a really interesting, different language to learn.
