Hi [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/)! We, the WebStorm team, are excited to announce our first AMA. We’ve never done anything like this before, but we feel the time has come to try something new.

If you’ve never heard of WebStorm, it is a JavaScript IDE by JetBrains. It comes with out-of-the-box support for lots of popular technologies and lets you do most of your development tasks right inside it. More information is available on [our website](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

We’ll start answering your questions at 12 pm UTC on the 24th of August and will be doing this until 5 pm UTC. You can ask us about anything related to WebStorm or the JavaScript support in any other JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, or PyCharm Professional.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers.

Your questions will be answered by:

* Andrey Starovoyt (WebStorm Team Lead), [u/anstarovoyt](https://www.reddit.com/user/anstarovoyt/),
* Ekaterina Prigara (WebStorm Product Manager), [u/prigara](https://www.reddit.com/user/prigara/),

We use [the \_test convention](https://medium.com/@alexewerlof/the-test-convention-e3b76f7f49b4) (medium post, no paywall). The juice of it: expose them through an object called \_test to clarify the intention.

What do you think? Do you have a better way? Any feedback/tips is welcome.

*Edit: I know testing internals is a controversial topic, but pls have a look at the article for elaboration.*

Hi All,

I am looking for a online IDE/website where I can save programms so that I can later retrieve them before interview. Leetcode allows you to save only 10 programs in its playground feature.

As I am preparing for interview and there are many programs which are not in leetcode but on other forums. For which I want to solve and save for future reference.

It would be also helpfull to understand if there are any other websites helpfull for interview prep

Thanks
