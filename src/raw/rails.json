As far as I can tell, almost all of them try to sell you a USB stick which contains the private key and is a required hardware module for compliancy with the US Esign Act. I don't understand: how am I supposed to use a physical stick with our AWS-hosted website? Who would want the certificate on a USB stick?\n\nOne provider told me that I could host the certificate on AWS CloudHSM, which seems like it would be the best place to keep it, as there are both Ruby and Linux client libraries for interacting with it. However, this costs $1.80/hour, aka $12,000/year, so even this is an imperfect solution.\n\nThe prices I've been quoted have been horrendous:\n\n$5000/year for 50,000 signatures per year (This price is 50% off!)\n\nMost of them also don't offer money-back guarantees, which I really want in order to ensure that the Adobe recognizes the signature created by the crude Origami method linked above.\n\nAfter several weeks, providing a utility bill in my name, my notarized passport, and a bank statement one AATL provider, along with a phonebook verification to my company's founder, and asking finance to give them some more company bills, I finally got a certificate for $100/year for 3 years with refund guarantee. HOWEVER, despite them SWEARING to me that they would allow me to host the certificate on AWS Cloud HSM, they said \"oh haha!!! We don't do that for document signing certificates!!! hahaha!!!! Why would you think that!!!\" So I am begging them to make an exception for me (upgrade to ENTERPRISE!) but I'm not optimistic.\n\nSo what am I supposed to do?\n\n\\#1 Is there any way to use these stupid USB sticks with a Rails app hosted on AWS?\n\n\\#2 Do I really need the digital signatures? Why don't I just leave the PDF's without a digital signature and just an ink signature? I highly doubt that every PDF I ever open on my computer has a digital signature.\n\n\\#3 Can I just keep our own server-side checksums of the PDF's in case there is ever a dispute?\n\n\\#4 Can I try using one of the foreign providers to save some money?

As far as I can tell, almost all of them try to sell you a USB stick which contains the private key and is a required hardware module for compliancy with the US Esign Act. I don&amp;#39;t understand: how am I supposed to use a physical stick with our AWS-hosted website? Who would want the certificate on a USB stick?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One provider told me that I could host the certificate on AWS CloudHSM, which seems like it would be the best place to keep it, as there are both Ruby and Linux client libraries for interacting with it. However, this costs $1.80/hour, aka $12,000/year, so even this is an imperfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prices I&amp;#39;ve been quoted have been horrendous:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$5000/year for 50,000 signatures per year (This price is 50% off!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of them also don&amp;#39;t offer money-back guarantees, which I really want in order to ensure that the Adobe recognizes the signature created by the crude Origami method linked above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After several weeks, providing a utility bill in my name, my notarized passport, and a bank statement one AATL provider, along with a phonebook verification to my company&amp;#39;s founder, and asking finance to give them some more company bills, I finally got a certificate for $100/year for 3 years with refund guarantee. HOWEVER, despite them SWEARING to me that they would allow me to host the certificate on AWS Cloud HSM, they said &amp;quot;oh haha!!! We don&amp;#39;t do that for document signing certificates!!! hahaha!!!! Why would you think that!!!&amp;quot; So I am begging them to make an exception for me (upgrade to ENTERPRISE!) but I&amp;#39;m not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what am I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#1 Is there any way to use these stupid USB sticks with a Rails app hosted on AWS?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#2 Do I really need the digital signatures?
