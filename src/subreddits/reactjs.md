## [3][Anyone else refuse to do technical assessments or take-home tests when interviewing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jedwv4/anyone_else_refuse_to_do_technical_assessments_or/)

I'm not actively looking for a job, but I've passively thrown out resumes recently just for interviewing practice and had a bite today. They said they 'loved my experience', and then proceed to tell me that I have to complete a 2 hour technical assessment - wait for it...

... *Before* I have an interview with a human.

WTF?

* I have a portfolio packed with 12 real-world projects spanning over 8 years of professional experience. Reference that.
* I have a github with even more projects, most with production code. Again - reference that.
* I have eight years of experience. Not trying to be cocky or anything, but come on.
* I don't have the time. I have a full time job and a family.

Anyway I've never encountered this before, so this was my response: 

"Hi guy,

Thanks very much for getting back to me.

I'm very busy with my work schedule as well as raising a toddler to find time for a technical test. You can find professional code in my github on my resume.

A phone interview would help solidify my abilities.

Thanks!
Me"

Who knows what'll happen but I can't believe this is the norm, if it is. Any job, including my most recent where I got it last year, did not have a test. They all followed one formula:

- In person. Non technical and technical talk, shooting the shit. See if I'm a fit.
- Offer

That was it. For every job I've ever had in the past eight years.

Does anyone else agree to these tests? I've also heard of so many devs take these test, and get ghosted. Screw that.

I've been using native ES6 Promises on a project, until I saw an error in the console; turns out the component is unmounting while the promise is still pending. The suggested React warning is : "To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method."

Ok, but then I find out ES6 Promises are not cancellable.  what the ?

What do you React gurus do? (Ideas please, too lazy to Google for hours on end)

**NB**: question is not related to ajax or server-side fetching.

Has anyone bought the React Epic Course/Workshop by Kent Dodds ([https://epicreact.dev/](https://epicreact.dev/))?

I wonder if it's worth the money and the time for a developer that is using react for 3+ years. So would really appreciate some independent valuations.

Thanks

Hi guys,

Iâ€™m trying to hide one ListItem (item 1) depending if a variable is 0 or 1.

and Itâ€™s a long list, is there a way to conditionally render so I donâ€™t have to type the list twice?
so basicallyâ€”
vairable === 0 include item 1 if not hide item 1


&lt;List&gt;
  &lt;ListItem&gt;
    item 1
&lt;ListItem/&gt;

&lt;ListItem&gt;
    item 2
&lt;ListItem&gt;

&lt;ListItem&gt;
    item 3
&lt;ListItem&gt;

&lt;ListItem&gt;
    item 4
&lt;ListItem&gt;

so on...

&lt;/List&gt;
