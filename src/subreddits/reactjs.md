Welcome to **the biggest React job board in the world!** This is like Hacker News' **Who's Hiring** but just for React. Top Level comments must be **Job Opportunities.**

‚ö†Ô∏è NEW: WE ARE REQUESTING EVERYBODY FOLLOW [THE HN Who's Hiring FORMAT][format:hiring:hn]

**Company inc. | Job Title | City/State Location | Full-time/Part-Time | On-site/Remote | (Optional) Salary range | Website jobs page, other hard requirements etc.**

examples:

- **Thorn | San Francisco or Remote (US based) | Full-time Contract | $100k - $150k | Software Engineer | https://www.wearethorn.org/**
- **PolicyStat | Full-Stack Python+Django Software Engineer | Indianapolis, Vancouver, or REMOTE | Full Time | +\$80k**

Please include as much information as possible. **If you are remote-friendly, or open to sponsoring work visas to your country, say so! These are the top 2 questions!**

If you are looking for jobs, send a PM to the poster or post in our [Who's Available thread!][available:most recent]

## [5][Question to experienced devs: If you join a new team and see areas of code that are poorly coded, when do you suggest improving/refactoring it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gfmw0p/question_to_experienced_devs_if_you_join_a_new/)

You change your job, you join a new team, everything is fine. You set up your env, jump around the codebase. Then you see some important parts of the codebase that are pretty messy and you've got some ideas about improving it. Let's say those parts are quite important and have a significant impact on the speed of development and you believe the way it's done makes the app more bug-prone etc.

How would you approach it?

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

If you start right away, team might be worried that you're crazy beast and they have to keep an eye on you. If you'll fail - it might undermine their trust from the start.

If you do it and succeed - you'll have more trust and freedom to improve the project and if you're really good - it might have great impact on the way you'll improve the project in the long run

If you don't do it - it might be harder to do it later as you might hit the wall called 'lets not change it now' that will be hard to change.

## [9][Help: A lot of state bugs with App using context API as reducer, how do we resolve?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gfs5el/help_a_lot_of_state_bugs_with_app_using_context/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gfs5el/help_a_lot_of_state_bugs_with_app_using_context/

Hey there,   


We are using React context with the reducer pattern to manage our state.   
However, we keep running into a ton of state bugs.  
We have each action unit tested but we have very large and deeply nested state so lots of edge cases crop up.   


The actions themsleves are very complex and hard to reasonabout as well.  


Any advice on testing, architecture, or other that can help us reduce these bugs?
## [10][I'm so confused as to whether I should be using the Context API or Redux](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gfrrry/im_so_confused_as_to_whether_i_should_be_using/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gfrrry/im_so_confused_as_to_whether_i_should_be_using/

I honestly can't/don't know how to decide between the two. There are sources saying that the Context API is better than Redux, while other sources say the opposite. All I want to know is this:

1. ***What are the advantages the Context API has over Redux, and what are the advantages Redux has over the Context API?*** 
2. ***Are they interchangeable?*** 
3. ***Does one perform better than the other or is performance more about "it depends on your use case"?***

From my personal experience, the only reason why I'd opt for the Context API over Redux is because it uses up much less lines of code and is less all over the place, but I don't think that that's an excuse for strictly choosing it over Redux. Again, *I don't know*. I'm so confused.
