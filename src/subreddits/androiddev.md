* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hey,

I'm an Android dev, but recently I started looking into web dev. I found some nice CSS framework, Tailwind, and I played with it, by creating these beautiful themes. I attached a video with all themes.

You can download any theme for free, edit it and upload it on your server.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post the website, but if you like them I can give you a link.

Btw, If you want to create a website, but don't have a design tool to create your app preview I can help. Send me screenshot of your app and I will create a beautiful mock-up for Android or iOS.

Let me know if you find them useful. Thanks!

EDIT: They can be found here [LPFMA - landing pages for mobile apps](https://landingpagesformobileapps.com/)

## [6][I want following functionality in an Android fragment. Stuck on choosing between different views](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g14n2y/i_want_following_functionality_in_an_android/)

I have created a fragment and two tabs (hence two other fragments) in  it. I want following functionality from each tab. I have a list of items in the following way inside a tab fragment. A  button will be present at end. (Outside below the two Tab fragment)

    CustomerName1 Phone_Number Amount
           Product_1 Quantity Number CheckBox
           Product_2 Quantity Number CheckBox
           Product_3 Quantity Number CheckBox
    CustomerName2 Phone_Number Amount 
           Product_2 Quantity Number CheckBox
           Product_3 Quantity Number CheckBox
    CustomerName3 Phone_Number Amount
           Product_1 Quantity Number CheckBox

The functionality I'm searching for is

1.) You can add as many customer as you want (I tried it with ListView)

2.) There can be any number of products that a customer wants (Variable products length) 

3.) One clicking the checkbox and pressing the button below at the bottom, that product should be removed from list.

4.) After the last product for a customer is removed, the customer entry should also be gone.

I implemented each row of Customer-product combo using listView. Then  for the products I created a linearLayout (I don't want products inside  a specific customer to be scrollable) But I seem to have hit the dead  end and feels like it's the wrong way to implement the functionality.

Recently, the audio (e.g., the voice from the Google Translate app, or a local MP3 file sound from Google Play Music) coming out from an AVD randomly has FM-radio-like noise. Is anyone else experiencing this?

I am not sure about the exact condition, but if I start an AVD and play the voice in the Google Translate, the sound is noisy. If I keep pressing the voice button, the noise gradually gets reduced up to the level that I am not sure if there is a noise or not. Then, if I play mp3 in Play Music, there is no or minimal noise, too. If I do the same thing with Google Translate and Google Music reversed, the same thing happens. That is, Google Music has initially noisy, then I keep stop/play, the noise gradually disappears, and then if I start the voice in Google Translate, there is no or minimal noise.

* Emulator version: 30.0.5-6306047
* AVD: Google Play API 28,29,R
* Sound hardware: On-board Realtek ALC887
* OS: Windows 10 (1909)

How I check before add on database if record exists on database? And popup a message to user if record is on database?

&amp;#x200B;

When click button to put data on database :

`btn_ok_add.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {`  
 `u/Override`  
 `public void onClick(View v) {`  


 `EditText region = (EditText) popup.findViewById(R.id.field_region);`  
 `EditText code = (EditText) popup.findViewById(R.id.field_connected_code);`  
 `SQLiteDatabase database = context.pdfDatabaseManager.getWritableDatabase();`  
 `ContentValues newValues = new ContentValues();`  
`}`  
 `newValues.put(PDFDatabaseManager.KEY_REGION, region.getText().toString());`  
 `newValues.put(PDFDatabaseManager.KEY_CODE, code.getText().toString());`  
`long found = database.insert(PDFDatabaseManager.DATABASE_REGION_TABLE, null, newValues);`  
 `database.close();`  
 `a.dismiss();`  
 `Toast.makeText(context, "insert correct!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();`  
 `}`

&amp;#x200B;

on database class :

&amp;#x200B;

`final String  QUERY_CREATE_REGION_DATABASE = "CREATE TABLE " +`  
 `DATABASE_REGION_TABLE + " (" +`  
 `COLUMN_ID_REGIONS + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, " +`  
 `KEY_REGION + " TEXT NOT NULL, " +`  
 `KEY_CODE + " TEXT NOT NULL, " + " BIT Default 0 NOT NULL"+`  
 `");";`

I'm not sure if it's a problem or not but it's got me confused. The internet tutorials and books I've seen show that there are two xml files in res&gt;layout folder (activity\_main and content\_main) in a basic template. But I've got two extra files(first\_fragment and second\_fragment) and even the text view is in first fragment with an extra "next" button (extra because it's not in the tutorials) are there in the "first\_fragment" file.  I'm pretty sure I sound like an idiot and it's not a big deal but I'm a little afraid that it might get in my way later

Thanks to the team at bumble for doing this AMA, but when I read 1.3million lines of code, I couldnt help but this what in the world is needing all that the client is using?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal, from those who have been working in apps with this scale?   
Been working at a large startup/scale up and since we decided the backend/gateway will compute and the app is only rendering most things, I can't stop thinking of all these lines of code.   
Even assuming half, thats 700k for each app.
