We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Hi, I will be flying two long haul flights and would love to continue learning Reactjs while I'm offline and in air (in total ~22 hours). Do you have any recommendations for me to crank through during this flight?

I was going through an Udemy course and just completed Reactjs basics. But I see that the project the tutorial will be working on next uses Firebase so I can't do that while I'm offline.

I am trying to build my first React app which is your standard weather app that gets data from OpenWeatherMap API. I have not styled the application at all because I wanted to make sure that I have the functionality down first. I want to be sure that I understand the basics of React and fix all the issues before they become more ingrained in my head and make me struggle with more advanced React concepts. Please highlight everything you see wrong with my code even if it is something minor. To get directed to the Github repo please [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/rimeikis/weatherapp-reactjs) .

The thing I struggle the most is the component hierarchy and one way data flow. I want to know if I have used variable and function props accordingly. Also, I am unsure about my component for fetching API data also being responsible for rendering the other 2 components.

Finally, I have a problem with conditional rendering. My data object contains an image id which is used in an &lt;img&gt; tag. If the data is not loaded then it is hidden apart from the image. Instead, it shows a broken image with the "alt" text next to it. I want to make it so if the data object has not been loaded then there should not be even an alt tag with the broken image icon on the screen. This is what logic I use for my conditional rendering:`{ error ? "There has been an error!" : ( loading ? "Loading data..." : data ) }`

Thanks!


Edit: just wanted to again thank everyone who took some of their precious time to help a random person on reddit by reviewing some code. I appreciate all of your comments!

**1)** Is React one of the best tech stack to develop both web and mobile applications ? or you feel that C# and Java can compete in the Frontend space ?

**2)** Why so many Java and C# programer dislike JS ? Is it because they prefer OO programming and their old concept from the 80's over functionnal programming with JS or the modern stuffs ? They talk about Blazor, Web Assembly and Java servlet with the first 2 doesn't seem ready for production ?

Hey, I have the following code. It works for most of the part when I try to setState in axios it gives me this error. WHY?

      constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                loading: false,

            }
        }

      axios({

                        method: 'post',
                        data: values
                    })
                        .then(function (response) {
                            console.log(response);
                            message.success('Success');
                            this.setState({
                                otpSent: true
                            })
                        })
                        .catch(function (error) {
                            if (error.response !== undefined) {
                                let fail = error.response.data.message;
                                console.log(fail)
                                message.error(fail)

                            }
                            else {
                                message.error("Something went wrong")
                            }

Hey I am building a webshop app in React and I have a couple of question on how to handle the loading of images and redirecting to other sites.. So right now when I click some &lt;Link /&gt; on my site, it takes me to the other site, but without any animation or anything, it just appears in front of you. The problem I think with that is that it looks kinda boring and uninteresting. Also, if I have a couple of &lt;img /&gt; tags on that site, you can see them loading in.. I am wondering how do you handle things like that? Do you put animations on loading new sites? Or do you put some sort of loading icon? How do I know when a &lt;img /&gt; tag is loaded and I can show the page to the user? Should I maybe put a loading tag instead of each img? Thanks for any help

## [12][Is there any way to center the scrollbar position before rendering ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f87tee/is_there_any_way_to_center_the_scrollbar_position/)

Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

'm trying to do a mobile display with a vertical list of articles. And I want each of these articles to be scrollable horizontally with an item on both sides of the article that will display if I scroll/swipe horizontally. For that I need the main articles to be centered.

&amp;#x200B;

How can u achieve that ? 

&amp;#x200B;

Would look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;LeftItem /&gt;
           &lt;CenteredItem /&gt;
           &lt;RightItem /&gt;
        &lt;li/&gt;
    
        &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;LeftItem /&gt;
           &lt;CenteredItem /&gt;
           &lt;RightItem /&gt;
        &lt;li/&gt;
    
        &lt;li&gt;
           &lt;LeftItem /&gt;
           &lt;CenteredItem /&gt;
           &lt;RightItem /&gt;
        &lt;li/&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

LeftItem and RightItem are supposed to be hidden on page launch. Then swipe CenteredItem to right or left to display the according Item.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I managed to explain what I'm trying to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks
