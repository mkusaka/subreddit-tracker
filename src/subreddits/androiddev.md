* How do I pass data between my Activities?

Title says it all. They basically said if I offer my app temporarirly for free (make a promotion) for just couple days, they can promote my app and I could get many downloads.

I received email form them, and after discussing details they send me [detailed instructions like this](https://imgur.com/C5H2sEl)

I have several questions:

1) is it compliant with Google Play rules, if 3rd party server promotes my app? 

2) is it compliant with Google Play rules to alter my app description  (see email) with link to their website?

3) are they legit? Anybody has experiences if it is actually worth it? Do you get any significant downloads?

Thanks a lot :)

## [7][what kind of source is included when publishing Android AAR to Maven Central](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jv14d7/what_kind_of_source_is_included_when_publishing/)

Let say I want to publish an open-source Android library (i.e. AAR) to Maven Central. This means we need to have a JAR contains source code of the library (i.e. \*-sources.jar). So what do you put into the source JAR?

\- Of course, we need to put Java/Kotlin sources (and maybe C code if we have)

\- How about the java/kotlin resources?

\- How about Android resources like layouts, manifests, images, and other assets?
## [8][Question about changing MinSDKVersion for my app](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/juzuof/question_about_changing_minsdkversion_for_my_app/)

I'm trying to figure out what happens in the Google play store when I change the MinSDKVersion for my app and I'm hoping someone can help me out.

For example, let's say App v1.0.0 is currently in the Google Play store with a MinSDKVersion of OS 7 and all my users have that version installed on their phones. Next week, I plan to release App v1.1.0 with a couple important bug fixes, and it will have the same MinSDKVersion (OS 7). In 2 months, I plan to release App v2.0.0, and I'm going to increase the MinSDKVersion from OS 7 to OS 9.

Here's what I'm trying to figure out:

If one of my users has a phone running OS 7, and they choose not to update their app to v1.1.0, what will they see in the Google Play store after I release App V2.0.0? I can think of 2 possible scenarios:

A. The user on OS 7 will always be able to see and download the most recent version of the app that is compatible with the OS version they are running (in this case, App v1.2.0).

B. The user will not see any updated app versions available to them and they will be "stuck" on the app version they currently have installed (App, v1.0.0).

Thanks in advance for any help with this!!

## [10][Best practice for in-app subscription discounts - when you make a special limited-time discount for a yearly subscription, do you tend to allow that discount for all future years or only the first year?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jv6g9i/best_practice_for_inapp_subscription_discounts/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jv6g9i/best_practice_for_inapp_subscription_discounts/

I'm trying to work out what's best-practice here.  On the one hand it seems like it would be a lot simpler to offer the discount for all future years, and less chance of consumers complaining about missing the "first year only" text on the purchase page.  On the other hand, Google seem to have set up discounts to be mainly for first year only - unless I'm mistaken (that could actually be Apple I'm thinking of).

Thanks

## [12][Advice on Room + Firebase RTDB](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jv22p0/advice_on_room_firebase_rtdb/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jv22p0/advice_on_room_firebase_rtdb/

I'm trying to build a cloud backup and syncing mechanism for my offline app. The idea is to save my Room data into Firebase Real-Time Database (instead of some web server supported cloud RDBMS). I am new to Firebase Real-Time Database and see that it's a NoSQL database with JSON format data saved as key-value pairs.

I need to have my SQL querying and other advanced search and sorting features provided from Room. This means I'd have to write some sort of syncing mechanism between the Firebase RTDB and Room to sync my Room with the freshest dataset.

Is there an existing library that can help me with it or do I need to roll out my own syncing service between the two? Any help or ideas are appreciated. Thanks.

Edit:

Room                  &lt;-*syncs with\**\-&gt;             Firebase RTDB/Any on device Cloud Storage DB

Room:: Does local queries for app 

Firebase RTDB/ Etc :: Just saves a copy on cloud and syncs on changes
