I can't describe how horrible this experience was.  I am not looking forward to how much work I am going to have to do to get my money back.  This is not my first AWS certification (I have SA Pro and DevOps Pro), but is my first online exam.  The short version is: Don't take AWS exams via the Pearson Vue at home option, even if it is offered.  AWS should not be offering this option as I can attest it is a waste of time.  Ironically, AWS would have us use their services because of their high availability and scaling but apparently they don't ask their test partners to do the same!

It started off easy enough: I passed the initial 'checks' as it confirmed my internet speed, camera access, and microphone access.  I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.  I tried again, and then a third time.  Same experience.  As I write this, I left it on that page and the spinning is continuing.  This screen has been spinning for no less than 45 minutes.  At 8 minutes before my scheduled exam, I tried finding the help link.  A chat window opened, and I waited, and waited, and waited.  Still waiting as I write this.  My chat window has been open for 52 minutes and still no one to help.  Every two minutes I get ' All agents are currently assisting others. Thank you for your patience.' written in the window.  OK - what next?  They make it harder to find, but I got a phone number I can call.  I tried calling that.  Busy signal.  For the next 20 minutes I called back and back, busy signal.  Finally, I got it to actually pick up, but of course no human yet.  No estimate of time to when I can be helped.  They don't even have nice elevator music to listen to.  Who knows when I will be able to talk to someone.  This has been an exceedingly poor experience.

If you value your time, please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt a online exam with Pearson.  I worked hard to prepare for this exam and rescheduled things to fit around it.  Now, I will have to do that all again.

u/jeffbarr Is this the experience AWS is hoping to get with their testing partners?  This was a waste of my time and money.  Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.

For what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.

*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.  I am actually quite surprised.

How would one configure EC2 to only allow traffic through my CloudFront distribution?  I'm using CloudFront as a proxy for caching and for https, and would like to close off all direct access to my EC2's ip address.

Hello,

I posted a similiar question a few weeks ago.. but I couldnt fix it properly.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/g91m7h/aws\_workspace\_set\_keyboard\_language\_and\_disable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/g91m7h/aws_workspace_set_keyboard_language_and_disable/)  


Question: **How can I set the keyboard language (german) after deploying my own created image?**   


/r/[CARUFO](https://www.reddit.com/user/CARUFO/) told me the solution but its only working randomly.   


Solution:  

For the keyboard layout you have to deploy two registry keys via GPO:

HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Keyboard Layout\\Preload\\1

type: REF\_SZ

value: 00000407

And

HKEY\_USERS\\.DEFAULT\\Keyboard Layout\\Preload\\1

type: REF\_SZ

value: 00000407  


\+ GPO:  Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon   


If I enable the GPO above, my workspaces dont do a single sign on... I have to user login manually after I connted to my workspace.   


How do you set your language / keyboard layout?   


Many greetings

I'm trying to get userdata outputs and errors into the system logs that are presented either through the gui or using

    aws ec2 get-console-output

I'm having a hard time, has anyone gotten this to work?  
I've tried solutions like this:  [https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-log-user-data/](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-log-user-data/)   
but it doesn't seem to work for RHEL 7. I"ve also tried passing my commands to tty0 and ttyS0 with no luck  
for example:   
echo "testing system log with tty0" &gt; tty0  
echo "testing system log with ttyS0" &gt; ttyS0

Still no luck.

I"ve noticed that the Amazon Linux ami does this automatically, but I have a client where we must use RHEL 7.x currently.
## [7][AWS can’t be used for remote access VPN to DC without NAT?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/grgw3p/aws_cant_be_used_for_remote_access_vpn_to_dc/)

Hey all, 

Been setting up and testing always on VPN configs as of late, and there is a final hurdle for us. 

We have a DC/Office network, with a Direct connect to AWS.  In aws I have a VPC with NLB and public subnet allowing traffic to an RRAS vpn server.  

By amazons rules, an IP not originating from the VPC CIDR will be dropped when it tries to leave the VPC.   This is discussed extensively in various papers and videos by amazon architect, but only in relation to VPC peering and transitive routing.  

Now, we have a vpn set up which NATs out of the RRAS box and routes fine all the way to our office, but for our applications we can’t use NAT, so need the clients issued with an IP from a different subnet.  I have followed the guides and advice and have a non Nat subnet set up for vpn clients which is outside of the VPC CIDR.  this is to allow the route for that subnet to be added to the VPC route table, and pointed at the RRAS server interface. 

Routing works lovely across AWS, but our AWS guys are skeptical that we can get this subnet routing back into our DC.  

For arguments sake,  say our VPC CIDR is 10.0.0.0/16, and we have a client vpn subnet hanging off the RRAS server of 192.168.100.0/24, which is then added to the VPC route table. Source destination checks disabled on instances as well. The RRAS instance is acting as a router and VPN server. 

Any thoughts on whether this remote access use case reaches the limitations of AWS architecture?

Unfortunately it is not well documented!

Best regards

Hello,

I'm looking for some tips about AWS DataSync for cold storage offload in S3 Glacier/Deep Glacier.

My question is: let's suppose I've uploaded all my data directly to S3 Glacier storage class with AWS DataSync. Then I need to retrieve some of that data with a local NFS share linked to the same S3 bucket, can AWS DataSync manage the retrieval request of my files or I have to manage the data retrieval "by hand"? I think AWS DataSync will notice that the file is not accessibile and I've to retrieve the data that I want to restore "by hand".

Thank you

I'm using a fuse projection for an S3 bucket, but I start hitting 503 errors with ~2200GET TPS. 

I noticed the 5XX errors started coming when LIST requests plateau. I can't find the limit documented anywhere. Does anyone know what the limit is, and if it increases linearly with partitioning (auto or pre)

Thanks
