With [this commit](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/b60153241121297c94de976419d421683da4d51b) Pattern Matching is no longer marked as an experimental Ruby feature ðŸ™‚

I'm pretty impressed and somewhat envious php has this [https://phpsandbox.io/](https://phpsandbox.io/) , kinda like Codepen for the server. This is a pretty cool way to share your work, create bug reports, teach people etc (you can choose Laravel or a standard php server).

From a techinical perspective, how hard do you think it is to build something similar for Rails? I know spinning up an environment per user can't be cheap. Just toying with the idea of building this for Rails...

Everyone knows these:

* Naming things
* Caching

Any experienced programmers want to propose some others?

Ruby makes a lot of things easy, but what are some things you've had to deal with multiple times (maybe in multiple different languages) and it has always seemed *unexpectedly* hard?

I'll go 1st:

* Time math with zones ([this article](https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/) sums up why)

## [7][Rubocop Template For Productive Teams](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jmil8u/rubocop_template_for_productive_teams/)

A new Rubocop starter setup that is a great for teams that want to develop quickly and without restrictions.

[https://github.com/westonganger/rubocop\_template\_for\_productive\_teams](https://github.com/westonganger/rubocop_template_for_productive_teams)

It is imperitive for your team that your Rubocop configuration is flexible and super-powers your development workflow. Too many projects suffer from slowed development because of their Rubocop configuration. Most of this stems from that fact that the Rubocop defaults are too restrictive and opinionated in a bad way. Ruby was built for developer happiness but unfortunately using the default Rubocop setup seems to take away the joy of development. Use this template with Rubocop to bring back your Ruby joy

## [8][[Blog post] Which test framework should I learn, RSpec or Minitest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jm44yt/blog_post_which_test_framework_should_i_learn/)

I recently did a poll asking Rails developers what their biggest testing questions are. One of the most common questions was "Which test framework should I use, RSpec or Minitest?"

My take is that it's kind of a moot question because in all probability most Rails developers will be forced to use RSpec at our jobs, so that's what we might as well learn. Plus it doesn't even matter that much because testing principles are more important than test frameworks, and principles will translate easily from framework to framework.

I elaborate on my thoughts in the post linked below.

## [9][Handling CSV properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jm975n/handling_csv_properly/)

Not sure if this has been asked before, but Iâ€™m uploading some testing info via CSV to a dashboard of sorts and would like to give the uploader some power over what to upload. Say thereâ€™s like 20 different columns and thousands of rows in this file. No need to upload unnecessary data of this size, so Iâ€™d like to have the user choose which columns to include in the upload. 

I was thinking to just add a column.included? sort of functionality where Iâ€™d set a Boolean true/false in the upload form, but Iâ€™m not sure if that would actually work as simple as I think it would or if this has already been done and thereâ€™s an easier way to do it.
