The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring company—no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job. 

Posting top level comments that aren't job postings, [that's a paddlin](https://i.imgur.com/FxMKfnY.jpg)

Im receiving this error

&gt;Type '{ foo: "bar"; }' is not assignable to type 'Partial&lt;T&gt;' 

If every property in `T` is optional and `T` should contain at least `foo: string` then why is the return value invalid?

Maybe the easy solution is to just replace `Partial&lt;T&gt;` with `IFooBar` or `Partial&lt;IFooBar&gt;`, but what if I want this interface to be an abstract method for somebody else to implement?

&amp;#x200B;

BTW I have every strict option enabled

## [7][Including types for virtual module in a library](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ibohzx/including_types_for_virtual_module_in_a_library/)

I'm developing a library that generates a virtual module (essentially a string containing js code) at runtime, which users can import via e.g. \`import generated from 'my-virtual-module';\`. I want to include type definitions for this virtual module in my library.

If I hand-write a \`.d.ts\` file for my virtual module and include this in my package, how can I make sure that a consumer of my library is able to see/use these type definitions?

It may also be important to note that:

\- The name and types of the virtual module are always the same

\- The name of the virtual module is different to the name of the package that consumers install
