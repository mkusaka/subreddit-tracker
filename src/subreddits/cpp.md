**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.

* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* 🚨 **Updated Remote section.** 🚨 You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [🚨 **Updated!** 🚨 Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft?

Just created a route planner project using the io2D library ([https://github.com/iparikshitdubey/Route\_Planner\_using\_io2D/tree/master/CppND-Route-Planning-Project](https://github.com/iparikshitdubey/Route_Planner_using_io2D/tree/master/CppND-Route-Planning-Project)) as a part of my Udacity Nanodegree program. Although I understood most of the code the implementation and rendering of the io2D library are still beyond my understanding.

I am currently toying around with concepts and I was wondering if there's a way to enforce a class implementing a concept, without having to pass it into some function or template first. Like:

`struct MyAddableType requires Addable&lt;MyAddableType&gt; {`

`//error if MyAddableType does not satisfy concept`

`}`

Now this code doesn't compile unfortunately and I tried some tricks with inheritance, but wto no avail. Is there any way of achieving this? Thanks!

I've been writing a class to wrap around part of a C library that requires function pointers for callbacks. The callback should be instance-specific; however, a function pointer can't be made out of anything that involves `this` (`this` is a function parameter, and parameters can't be constant expressions).

Since all instances of this class will be `static`, I was able to come up with the following solution that I found to be interesting:

    template&lt;auto&amp; inst, auto func&gt;
    consteval auto make_member_callback() {
        return [](auto... args) { (inst.*func)(args...); };
    }
    
    // MyClass is a class that takes a function pointer as an argument
    constinit static MyClass mc {
        make_member_callback&lt;mc, &amp;MyClass::someCallback&gt;()
    };
(Try it online [here](https://godbolt.org/z/-Zo9S4) (or with a templated lambda [here](https://godbolt.org/z/erxmS-)))
 
My work is with a real-time operating system written in C, so being able to use this with all of the callbacks required by hardware will be helpful. Would anyone else find this useful?

I'd also enjoy it if, in the future, this could happen within a constructor. Right now this is prevented by `constexpr` parameters, though I would propose that a `constexpr/consteval` constructor (i.e. one that initializes a static object) should be able to access `this` at compile-time, since it appears that the static object's address/instance can be known.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Someone pointed out that a variadic generic lambda could be used instead of a templated lambda, which I think is simpler (and doesn't affect the resulting program). Changed the above example to match.

**Edit 2:** Thanks to everyone who suggested different variations of this code. As I've spent more time on this, I've been able to create the callback "within" the class:

    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    
    template&lt;auto&amp; v, auto f&gt;
    constexpr auto member_callback = [](auto... args) { (v.*f)(args...); };
    
    struct MyClass {
    public:
        using Callback = void (*)(const char *);
    
    private:
        int value;
        Callback callback;
    
        void myCallback(const char* data) { value = printf("%s: %d", data, value); }
    
    public:
        consteval MyClass(int v = 0) : value(v), callback(nullptr) {}
    
        template&lt;MyClass&amp; MC&gt;
        constexpr static auto&amp; init() {
            MC.callback = member_callback&lt;MC, &amp;MyClass::myCallback&gt;;
            return MC;
        }
    
        Callback getCallback() const { return callback; }
    };
    
    int main() {
        constinit static MyClass mc = (mc = MyClass{42}, MyClass::init&lt;mc&gt;());
        mc.getCallback()("hi");
        return 0;
    }

Say you have (in non-library code) a

    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;

do you write

    auto iter = find_if(cbegin(v), cend(v), [](auto i) { ... });

anticipating that ADL will find `std::cbegin()`, `std::cend()` and `std::find_if()` because the vector is a type from `std`, or do you spell the namespace on the function calls?
