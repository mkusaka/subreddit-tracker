## [7][How do you use context.Context in your applications?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/fo395d/how_do_you_use_contextcontext_in_your_applications/)

The context in Go is very popular. The most popular use case is the cancellation and setting timeouts. But, we can pass some scope-related data in it. And here's my question: do you do it?

One use case I can imagine is putting the authenticated user's details in the middleware and retrieving them in the final HTTP handler. What's your practice?

I'm asking because I noticed that every time I try to put ANYTHING into the context, I have a very long discussion about it in PRs. Do you have any (in your opinion) good examples of using \`context.WithValue\` and similar? Should we use it this way or not?

We've got a gRPC server on Kubernetes managing a set of streams. I'm getting abnormally high memory usage right now and am wondering what the best way to profile it is?
