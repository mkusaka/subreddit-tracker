Hi! Learning Ruby since a few months and built this scraper for learning purposes. I want to add it to a rails app and deploy on heroku later. Would that be possible?

See here the github [https://github.com/sljmn/bol\_scraper](https://github.com/sljmn/bol_scraper) and demo in readme. Any feedback on my code?

With this scraper you can find the inventory for a certain product, based on ean.

What is the best way to source external files into the kramdown of my Jekyll site post? I am creating code tutorials and would like the code snippets to reside in an external git repo in script form.

Hi guys, Ruby Noob on here. 

I was thinking of building a basic browser, and I was told that at the very least, I would need a HTML parser and a way to get HTTP request. 

So my question is, can I build a parser for a markup like HTML in ruby? And if so, what are the constraints and factors I should consider?
