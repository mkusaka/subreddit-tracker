Is it possible to go straight from months of programming to becoming a freelancer? Does freelancing not pay as much as being employed at a company?

What about freelancing as a web designer? Are there too much competition either as a javascript developer or web designer developer?

With the rise of coronavirus, would this mean that many people will be thinking of going into IT sector so that they can work from home to stay safe from the virus, and with the competition would pay will go down for everyone in the field?

Will people be willing to hire newbies remotely from the start (especially because of the virus?) for a JS job? I've been thinking of JS because I read that you can work on both front and back end as well as mobile with JS. But I also read that Python will be more popular than JS. Anyway would you say that JS would have better job prospects compared to Python if you want to freelance remotely?

I can use `?` for ternary expressions but I have come across `??` in a scenario like this:

`const y = x?.value ?? j`

Is this some kind of value specific ternary operator like `===` that is being used in a `null` check?

I'm taking a course online dated back to 2017, and the instructor uses the Underscore Api for some object-related tasks (e.g. looping through properties, turning strings into objects, etc.).

I'm wondering if I should learn this sort of library. Do you still use it? No? Would you recommend new developers to learn it or skip it?  


UPDATE: Seems like Lodash is still popular. Thanks for your comments!
