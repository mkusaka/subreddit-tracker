We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi everyone,

A while ago I was looking for a simple to use and customizable way to display a google calendar on a website. Google's embedded calendar has a dated design and little customization, so I decided to make my own that hopefully improves on these aspects.

It pulls events from a Google Calendar and displays them in a month view. It shows more information about the event when clicked, and properly supports recurring events (using rrule), including instances that have changed or been deleted.

I am still pretty new to react and this is my first time making an npm package, so I would love to hear any feedback on the design, code, or anything else you want to say.

## [10][Naming Conventions for React - Apollo GraphQL?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hbzznj/naming_conventions_for_react_apollo_graphql/)

Hello - I've just started working on a React + GraphQL project at work and I'm curious if there is a naming convention for queries and mutations that is typically followed?  (Our project also uses codegen)

Would love to see an example of a query and a mutation that you are following including the gql tag export, the operation name and then the actual query/mutation.

Thanks
## [11][With react router how can I use a static navbar on just some routes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hbt1hd/with_react_router_how_can_i_use_a_static_navbar/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hbt1hd/with_react_router_how_can_i_use_a_static_navbar/

I am trying to setup nesting in the react router. I have the following code:

    
        import React from 'react';
        import DefaultSwitch from './components/DefaultSwitch/DefaultSwitch';
        import './scss/App.scss';
        
        const App = () =&gt; {
            return (
                &lt;DefaultSwitch /&gt;
            );
        };
        export default App;

With `DefaultSwitch` defined as:

     const DefaultSwitch = () =&gt; {
            return (
                &lt;Switch&gt;
                    &lt;Route exact path='/' component={Landing} /&gt;
                    &lt;Route exact path='/login' component={Login} /&gt;
                    &lt;Route exact path='/logout' component={Logout} /&gt;
                    &lt;Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} /&gt;
                &lt;/Switch&gt;
            );
        }

Inside the `Dashboard` I have the following:

    const Dashboard = () =&gt; {
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;MyNavbar /&gt;
                    &lt;DashboardSwitch /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        };

And finally `DashboardSwitch` as:

     const DashboardSwitch = () =&gt; {
            return (
                &lt;Switch&gt;
                    &lt;Route exact path='/dashboard' component={Home} /&gt;
                    &lt;Route exact path='/dashboard/home' component={Home} /&gt;
                    &lt;Route exact path='/dashboard/bonuses' component={Bonuses} /&gt;
                &lt;/Switch&gt;
            );
        }
    

Routing appears to work and the correct components are loaded, however I have noticed that if for example I am at `/dashboard` and then navigate to `/dashboard/bonuses` the entire page is reloading including the `MyNavbar` component. I want the navbar to remain static and only the content below it to reload as I have defined in the \`Dashboard\` component.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I doing wrong here?
