I'm still very much learning Ruby, and by no means a learned coder, so this might be a dumb request but I can't figure out a solution and I'm getting worn out trying to figure it out. :)  I was reluctant to give up and post this question but I'm starting to drive myself crazy. I am trying to figure out how to handle some data and have it in a presentable format. Every time I come up with an idea I run into a challenge I don't know how to overcome. So instead of taking myself down the wrong road, I thought I'd inquire here to see if anyone with some experience might have a recommended approach.

When the script runs it will be cataloging a small inventory of items for a given day. It will run in a loop and move through the days to collect months of daily inventory. It could start at any time during the month and it could as many as 13 or even 18 months worth of inventory. The inventory items are small, probably no more than 10 in total. Ideally, I'd like it to be able to handle new and unexpected items instead of relying on known items. 

So, the data would be something like:

2/15/2020 - bread, banana, apple

2/16/2020 - tomato, banana, apple, rice, water

My first idea was to have it displayed in a monthly calendar format where I could turn on or off what items are displayed and then cycle or page through the months. With the example, I could see everything or set a filter to see what days had bananas and rice only. I would even do separate calendars for each item.  Then I was trying to think of how to do tables or just a spreadsheet.

I can get the total and collect the items individually, I am just spiraling into a rabbit hole confusing myself on what kind of data structure I can put it in and how to get it displayed. At this point, I am not sure I know the difference between what is possible and what I am capable of. :)  

Any amount of help would be appreciated. A point in the right direction or spelling it out like I'm 5 -- I'll take what I can get!

Hello, for the [planet.rb feed reader](https://github.com/feedreader/planet.rb) I try to add a sanitize HTML option. One idea is to (reverse) convert HTML to markdown, that is, structured text. What are the best options / ways in 2020 to get from HTML to Markdown? Thanks for any tips and links. Cheers.

Asynq is a simple Go library for queueing tasks and processing them in the background with workers.  
It is backed by Redis and it is designed to have a low barrier to entry. It should be integrated in your web stack easily.

Hi. I am the author of a gem called StrongVersions. I have been using it successfully on quite a number of projects and thought it may be worth sharing in case others find it useful. The gem provides a command which validates the version definitions in a Gemfile (more info in links below).

I find it especially useful in continuous integration builds when working with large teams.

Bug reports/suggestions are welcome. Have a nice day.
