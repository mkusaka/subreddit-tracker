 Hello, readers of Reddit, I’m writing to you from cold Russia:)  
I’m here to share with you one more story of a developer’s account lock-out in Google Play. On the 26th of March, in the evening, I received a standard email from Google: 

[ Letter from Google ](https://preview.redd.it/5ooieknstqv41.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a56cdafefc1958d4a9867f80874ad002dfa214b9)

 At first I didn’t understand what’s the problem is and of course I sent a notice of appeal. I received a standard answer. The same was with the next notice of appeal. **Now I already have 7 notices of appeal**. I don’t even receive any automatic answer for the last ones. It seems to me that a few days ago I found out the reason of a possible lock-out. One of my games was tested by the publisher at his account. During this period the game got two warnings as a result of violation with incorrect integration of SDK of the necessary services. The publishers didn’t like the game and they returned it to my account. And maybe their rejects came to my account together with the application. I’m not absolutely sure in it, but this is the only rational basis.  
 **That’s why be careful with transference of the application after its rejects on the other people’s accounts**. I can’t understand the politics of Google. Why should I be responsible for the other people’s rejects with the help of my account? Whereby their account continues to exist. Is it fair? I also want to add that I’m not a creator of trash applications and games. I had 2 qualitative games on my single account (**which is more than two years old**). I spent a lot of **thousands of dollars**, as well as energy and time on each game. And we wanted least of all to violate the rules and somehow be in conflict with the bots from Google.

**My first** app was a cute door simulation game. A huge amount of effort was invested in it. It had about 30 thousand installations. Unfortunately, the application could not pass the test at the publisher. And had the status: Reject. This was due to the obsolete Appodeal SDK. I made plans to revive this game and retest the publisher with the hope of a positive result. (I apologize for the screenshots with the text, this is not an advertisement)

**The second** game was a dark platformer about black substance. This game has gone through many iterations. And during the next test, I got a ban on the whole account. Most likely this particular game didn’t please Google bots. 

[Substance](https://preview.redd.it/84s4xp56uqv41.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b27527d2fba83810f1bfe2297f75cba889f264a0)

 What I have learnt and what I can share with people who are in the same situation is the following:

* Be careful with the transfers of the applications as you can get application rejects from the other people’s accounts and damage your account. (I’m not absolutely sure in it) - the way of searching for the people from Google at **LinkedIn + Rocket Reach** is useless. I tried to find people working in support with the help of these services during month. Unfortunately, in all the cases I faced up with ignoring. If someone wants to do this, then search for: Appeals Specialist at Google, Play Developer Support Specialist, Developer Support Specialist - Accenture\\Vaco at Google, Support Appeals Specialist - Accenture\\Vaco at Google. As I understood, Google transfers the part of operations concerning the support of the users to the companies **Accenture** and **Vaco**. But these are my personal insights and guesses. You shouldn’t accept them at their face-value. Possibly, somebody will be lucky and he or she will find a person who will answer.
* Sending emails is also quite useless. But here I was lucky and two people replied to me at once. One of them was from **Policy Team** and the other one was a **Developer Advocate**. They both told me that they felt sorry but couldn’t help me and they gave me a link for a standard form of a notice of appeal.
* If your account brings you less than 5 thousand dollars per month for inner purchases, then the likelihood that your notice of appeal will be considered by an alive person is about **1%**. Especially this situation heated up because of COVID-19. Maybe they don’t have enough specialists.
* The variant of asking for help people who I know and who work in Google also doesn’t work (they did an internal inquiry).
* Writing on the **Google Help Forum** is also useless.

Finally, there is only a variant with making this problem well-known. According to the same topics this variant may work and kind people from Google can see and give a break to the developer.  
Very sadly, that this problem lasts through years and is still relevant in 2020. I’m ready to **pay hundreds of dollars per year, and not 25 once**, if in hour of need there will be an alive person to help me, but not this useless AI.  
If anyone has questions about this topic or about Linkedin, you can write to me by email: [*black.rocket.st@gmail.com*](mailto:black.rocket.st@gmail.com)  
If a good person sees the post, my last appeal is: \[2-6426000030305\]

I have an app that asks the user for storage permission and cleans all empty folders from it. Because of the privacy changes in Android 10 and Android 11 we have to find another method for storage access because the write storage permission will be removed. I updated the app with SAF. And everything is working and even the sd card scanning which previously was not available. The problem is that it is working very slow. If I select the main storage folder it takes 2 minutes for an operation that was 2 seconds with the previous mechanism. Of course the bad reviews are starting. What should I do? How I can tell my users that this is the right way for the app to continue working?
Also I know there will be special permission in Android 11 for some apps to access the full storage but I don't know if my app will be accepted in this program. Regards!
## [6][Does it *critically* matter which frameworks, libraries, languages, architectures, databases, etc, I use for doing Android dev work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ga6kjt/does_it_critically_matter_which_frameworks/)

The deeper I go into Android dev the more I realize there are multiple methods of doing something. 

For dependency injection I can use Dagger2 or Kodein. 

For setting up an online database I can use Firebase or Heroku.

For setting up an offline database I can use Room or Realm.

For the base language I can use Kotlin or Java.

I can use Synthetic or use ViewBinding to make references to Views in a Fragment/Activity class. 

For the architecture I can go for MVP or MVVM. I mean, I can keep going on and on. 

All choices if used correctly will allow me to develop properly working Android apps. But would it lead me to get alienated in Android job placements just because I prefer using one over the other?

"Oh, you prefer using Kodein for your dependency injection needs? Sorry we won't hire you. We only use Dagger2 here" I doubt that companies are this picky. Surely I could be trained to use another library easily, as long as I know the core concepts of what dependency injection is in the first place, right? Unless I am mistaken.

Let's say I wanna make an app that suggests people to connect with close contacts they haven't spoken to in quite some time. Is there some way I can get data like who's the most contacted etc from others apps like WhatsApp?
## [9][Why indie developers should not waste there time with Facebook Audience Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ga9dgl/why_indie_developers_should_not_waste_there_time/)

Recently I decided to implement Facebook Audience Network to show ads in my mobile application. After I made all the integration stuff and filled out all required registration info my application was successfully approved to the network. But monetization is still blocked - I cannot add bank info to the Payouts because of some bug which treats SWIFT number as invalid one.

I made support ticket and attached screenshot with error. In response I got following answer: "Thank you for applying for Audience Network. At this time we are unable to accept your application. We thank you for your patience while we determine the ideal process for bringing new publishers on to the network.".

I was shocked about such response. Ticket was closed to any appeal and I created a new ticket where asked about reasoning for such statement. To my surprise I received exactly same answer as previous one.

As a conclusion I suggest for everyone to avoid my mistake and do not spend your time to just get such a crap from Facebook.
## [10][How do you stream audio to and from a phone call?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ga93dh/how_do_you_stream_audio_to_and_from_a_phone_call/)

I want to make an app that lets me take and make a phone call from my PC that's on the same LAN network as my phone. I know Microsoft's MyPhone app exists, but frankly, I'm not comfortable with giving them the permissions on my phone and I think it'd be a fun little(?) project to do on my own.

The closest thing I've found while searching online is [this old stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5268964/stream-audio-to-a-phone-call-android) saying that it is in fact impossible. But considering the aformentioned MyPhone app exists, I guess this has changed in the meantime.

Am I also correct in thinking that the best way to stream the audio once I have it over WiFi is using the [AudioStream](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/net/rtp/AudioStream) class?
