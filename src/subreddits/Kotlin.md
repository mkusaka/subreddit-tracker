I was excited to see that kotlin conf is just $600. I got to know that workshop is $900 and you can only attend one.  Is it worth that money? Any body attended those and care to share the experience, it would be great to hear from someone.

Hi guys, I've been thinking for a while that I want to shift into backend development from front-end.  
I've been hearing about Kotlin everywhere I go. I just wonder if Kotlin would be a nice starting point or if you would advice starting with a different language to learn?

For a school project I'm making an android app. We decided to implement our server in Kotlin as well. I thought it would be useful to create a multiple module application so the data classes that are send from the server only have to be edited at one place. Is this a good idea? And how should I do this?

Working with a group of researchers and they mainly know Java. What are the biggest advantages that Kotlin has over Java ?

The developmental branch of [BoofCV](https://boofcv.org) contains a bunch of Kotlin [extensions/overloaded operations](https://github.com/lessthanoptimal/BoofCV/tree/SNAPSHOT/integration/boofcv-kotlin/src/main/kotlin) that clean up the API a bit. As a first test I wrote a few QR Code examples ([Github](https://github.com/lessthanoptimal/KBoofExamples/tree/master/src/main/kotlin), [Medium w/video](https://medium.com/@peter.abeles/qr-code-scanner-in-kotlin-e15dd9bfbb1f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ef089675e392f8bb43dde10f583f8770)) (e.g. create, scan, estimate 3D pose) in Kotlin where many of these new features are used. 

As an example of what I've done with extensions, [BufferedImage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html) has been extended with functions for converting it into more useful data types. This is much easier than the Java equivalent. A lot of math operations now also have a cleaner API.

What I'm hoping to get is feedback on the extensions, also how Kotlinized the example code is, and other suggestions for improving Kotlin integration (besides rewriting everything in Kotlin). I know the extensions are poorly documented at the moment and that's because they are a sketch.

Thanks!

Hey guys,

At my job we are about to use Helm charts to configure more easily our k8s cluster, but somewhere I've seen there's this Kotlin DSL for Kubernetes and I was looking at it and seems pretty good to be honest, specially by the fact I want to propose the usage of Kotlin for other aspects in the project.My questions are:

1. Is there any project example that uses this dsl besides of the ones that are documented in the repository?
2. Under the hood, how does this DSL connect with the kubernetes cluster? Is there any configuration that has to be done beforehand 
3. Or does this generate the yml configurations ready to use in kubernetes?

  
Thanks in advance people.
