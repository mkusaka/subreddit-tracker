## [3][What is the common convention for interface names?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fng5ji/what_is_the_common_convention_for_interface_names/)

Hello all,

I am learning Typescript and I was naming my interfaces happily until I arrived to Mongodb/Mongoose.  


For example, I had before an interface called User. However, when I create my model schema, in mongo without Typescript I would have called this User as well. Therefore, that would create a conflict.  


Is there a common convention about this?  


I see this guy in the link down below uses IUser but I have read also that Typescript community does not like using Iwhatever... and personally I do not like that either.

Therefore, do you know what is the most common way to naming mongo stuff and interfaces?  


Thank you in advance.
## [4][Need help with spread operator and Date in typescript](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fnhe74/need_help_with_spread_operator_and_date_in/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fnhe74/need_help_with_spread_operator_and_date_in/

Consider the below code:
```
export function(date :string) : Date{  
 const dateNumbers : number[] = date.split(/,|-| |:/).map(numText =&gt; Number(numText))  
 console.log(...dateNumbers);  
 return new Date(...dateNumbers)  
}
```
I cannot use spread operator for the new Date in typescript, but I actually can use it in javascript, the error is Expected 0-7 arguments, but got 0 or more.ts(2556)

Please help me with that, I could not figure it out.

 Good Morning I'm beginning to learn nestJS for a backend and so far liking it... 

I'm trying to wire up a front end React as i go along. this code snippet has no back end, it's just an example.

i'm puzzled by this typeScript issue.

The front end makes a request to the backend and what comes back is unknown, i know that it's a TaskI, because that's what the backend is responding with, but i wanted to emulate the case where the front end typescript can't know that and has to "prove" it out. so i set the data to type unknown... 

I was expecting a TS complaint, but here it allows me to push an any into my TaskI array, do you know why this is?

I shouldn't be able to push an any into a typed array.

More generally, not having worked with type unknown before, this is the concept of using type unknown, to prove to the compiler that a type is indeed a type?

Thanks for your time and consideration.

## [7][Confused by generic related compilation error.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fmgw5y/confused_by_generic_related_compilation_error/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fmgw5y/confused_by_generic_related_compilation_error/

Basically the code that I have that is leading to the compilation error is similar to this:

```
class Box&lt;T&gt; {

}

class Gen&lt;T extends Box&lt;number&gt;&gt; {
    private action(array: Array&lt;T&gt;): Array&lt;T&gt; {
        return new Array()
    }

    private useAction() {
        let x:Box&lt;number&gt;[] = new Array&lt;Box&lt;number&gt;&gt;();
        // This leads to the compilation error
        this.action(x)
    } 
}
```

I would expect this to work.

I defined `action` to take an array of any type, hence the `array:Array&lt;T&gt;`

In `useAction` I am calling the `action` method.

I am calling it with an array of `Box&lt;number&gt;`

Since I defined it to take any type, I expected passing a variable of type `Box&lt;number&gt;` to `action` should then work. 

But it fails with a compilation error:

&gt; Argument of type 'Box&lt;number&gt;[]' is not assignable to parameter of
&gt; type 'T[]'.   Type 'Box&lt;number&gt;' is not assignable to type 'T'.
&gt;     'Box&lt;number&gt;' is assignable to the constraint of type 'T', but 'T' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint
&gt; 'Box&lt;number&gt;'.

I can't decipher the error message. Why is it failing and how do I fix it?

I asked the question on StackOverflow, if you know how to crack this riddle, please feel free to answer the question over there

## [8][Proper TypeGraphQL architecture](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fmcymr/proper_typegraphql_architecture/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fmcymr/proper_typegraphql_architecture/
---
Trying to figure out the reference setup with TypeGraphQL and my feeling is...

- `@ObjectType` + the decorated class reflect the TS Type + SDL Type
- `@Resolver` + the decorated class reflect the resolver
- `@Service` + the decorated class which is DIed with `typedi` should reflect the data source

Where I am unsure is the last one, `@Service`: 

1. Does it makes sense?
2. Do I put actual db queries (in my case mongo native driver) there or do I make another extra class?
3. Why do I have to decorate also the resolver with `@Service`?
4. How would 3 differ re ActiveRecord and DataMapper pattern?
