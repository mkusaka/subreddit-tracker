Hi, everyone I'm somewhat kinda new to typescript but not oblivious to JavaScript, What I'm wanting to do (if possible) is wanting to combine my 3+ .ts files when it transpiles / compiles I would like for it to be in one .js file using the modular pattern.

similar to what sass kinda does with with multiply partials.

I saw a comment in the TSConfig file for "outfile" and I couldn't get it to work, I kept getting an error about lack of persmissions or something.

Hi there, i'd really like to use the cool new features like optional chaining..

I followed the npm i instructions from the blog

 [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/) 

however after it downloaded, tsc -- version still says i'm on Version 3.6.4

And the compiler still complains about optional chaining... do you know how to fix this?

Thanks much!
## [6][Is is possible to combine multiple NestJS Swagger decorators?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f03w6o/is_is_possible_to_combine_multiple_nestjs_swagger/)

Hi. I'm using NestJS and Swagger. Before each GET router which returns result as a list, i add these decorators:

    @Get()
    @ApiQuery({ name: "page", required: false })
    @ApiQuery({ name: "limit", required: false })
    @ApiQuery({ name: "sort", required: false })
    @ApiQuery({ name: "order", required: false })

Is there any chance that i could combine those into one custom decorator, such as `@GetListOptions()`?

## [8][Is it possible to write a class that overrides every method in a given object?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f03gg9/is_it_possible_to_write_a_class_that_overrides/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f03gg9/is_it_possible_to_write_a_class_that_overrides/

Let’s say I construct said class with an instance of Array&lt;?&gt;, is it possible to have this class implement all the methods that belong to array?

Like 
`(new Foo(arr)).filter(...).map(...).reduce(...)` 
for example, but all those methods would be mapped to exactly one overriding method in the Foo class?

Sorry if this isn’t clear enough.
## [9][Use discriminated union to make switch and if blocks typesafe](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ezxp1y/use_discriminated_union_to_make_switch_and_if/)

Is there a way to use a discriminated union to have the compiler infer the return type of a specific switch case or if block and throw an error if you're not returning the correct type?

I'd like to use this over a union of classes. I know how to set up the discriminated union but I can still return a totally wrong class.
