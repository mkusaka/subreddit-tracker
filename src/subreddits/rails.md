I am in the process of attempting my first deployment of a new app in Rails 6 and when it goes to do the first db migration I get `ArgumentError: Missing \`secret_key_base\` for 'production' environment, set this string with \`rails credentials:edit\``

I am all for setting this up, but I at this point I am confused as to if this is all something I set up production space or development space. Is there a good walk-through of how and where to set this up? I tend to learn best for seeing something set up in front of me. Any help will be great!

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I want to deploy a Rails app on my Apache2 web server. Coming from a PHP background, I'm used to the CGI-like approach of mod_php.

After reading through resources on this topic, I wanted to ask you whether it's a good or at least okay idea to do the following:

1.	Use Puma on the Rails app to start a local server
2.	Reverse proxy that through Apache2

I also read a lot about this Passenger thing, but it seems kinda weird to deploy. Any thoughts?
## [4][Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns in Rails?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/i5vg9b/design_patterns_and_antipatterns_in_rails/)

OK, it's more like a *software engineering* topic than a rails related one. But I asked one of my friends about deleting a table manually and re-do the migration (the project is written in Django and not rails) and he told me "This is an Anti-Pattern in Django". 

I knew possible dangers of the idea and I suggested it with the knowledge, but I jokingly answered him "You call everything you don't understand an anti-pattern". 

Now, I'm curious, is there a set of patterns and anti-patterns SPECIFICALLY for rails?

In this tutorial video I walk through how to create dynamic profile pages by user role.  We will use a technique I learned from my favorite Ruby on Rails tutorial creators, GoRails, to dynamically display the correct partial by current user role.

I received permission before posting from Chris at GoRails to demonstrate this technique which I have seen a few times, but never in this way.  I thought it may be an interesting application of the technique and also answered a subscriber request.  

I have only created 25 or so videos, so still very new to the process, all feedback is welcome as I just want to improve.

I have a Kafka consumer which keeps polling for new messages. Once a message comes in, I want to be able to update the database in my rails application using ActiveRecord. 


Model:


    class XYZ &lt; ApplicationRecord
         # ...
         def self.update_entity_record(en_id, status)
               # ...
         end
    end


Kafka consumer:


    # Setup Kafka connection
    # ...

    kafka.each_message(topic: my_topic) do |msg|
           msg = msg.value
           XYZ.update_entity_record(msg.fetch('en_id'), msg.fetch('status')
    end


Is it possible?

It looks like this gem hasn't had any commits for over a year now. Did Netflix stop maintaining this project? Would you guys recommend using another API builder?

## [11][Iâ€™m taking over an app which has zero test. I installed minitest and guard but running tests is extremely slow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/i5574g/im_taking_over_an_app_which_has_zero_test_i/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/i5574g/im_taking_over_an_app_which_has_zero_test_i/
---
Every time I run the test suite or that guard detects a change, the tests take something like 45 seconds to more then one minute to start. Thatâ€™s very unpractical especially since this app is quite big and has zero test written... Where should I look to try to understand and fix that first issue?
