This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [4][Blindly following Apple's design guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hziqnm/blindly_following_apples_design_guidelines/)

Background: My company has a native iOS and Android app. I'm lead for the Android project. Our design documents for new features and UI usually based on iOS because the designers all have iPhones and the company doesn't have the resources to make mockups for both platforms.

I often have to fight for variations to be accepted in the Android implementation. Sometimes the fight is easy, but there are still many times where I get push back with the argument "well Apple does it this way and Android really isn't known for its UX so..." I'm told to just do it the Apple way.

Today: I won't go into the details, but basically I argued for a change based on Android standards, and because the design doc just didn't make sense. I was shot down because the design was "based on Apple" and therefore better. So I conceded in the conversation, but went to look up the Apple design after the meeting: their design is the same as my suggestion and Android's, but the designer fudged it up in our design document.

How do you all deal with this kind of "Apple did it this way and even if it doesn't make sense to us, Apple knows best" mentality?

I'm making an Android app mod and almost all apps have an manifest.mf file.
There are text Lines with the path and the Sha-1 digest line. 

I need to add a file to the app.


[Manifest.mf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/169nnb_OpzAIZMgil0nXvHgk9yrjbOw98/view?usp=drivesdk)

So is there a way?

Btw I'm not the Creator of this app.
All I'm doing this modding this app.

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to change android.speech.tts's voice quality from QUALITY\_HIGH(400) to QUALITY\_VERY\_HIGH(500).

Has anyone managed to do this?

Thanks.

For multiple reasons, I have recently been wanting to change jobs. I have been doing Android dev since now about 6 years. I don't have an engineering background, I have a masters in Statistics, and I don't have any education at all in computer science, I am self-learned. I do not lie about this in my CV.  
Recently I have had many online interviews for Android developer jobs with the same scenario: they bring up the online coding thing and I am asked to solve some algo problem such as reversing a binary tree (for the easiest), or optimising the complexity of an existing algorithm. at the same time, I am not asked a single question on Android at all. I understand that these companies want some high-level engineering people, but why put through all the recruiting process with someone for an Android dev job if they are clearly looking for engineers? I admit, I am not an engineer, my solving problems skills have some limits (which can probably be compensated with a google search) but I still have a scientific approach and tend to always look for optimal solutions to a problem. nevertheless, these companies will probably end up recruiting a very talented person who might not know much on android development rather than a great android developer which will deliver a top quality app in little time.  
let me guys know what you think about this.

## [12][I am a self-taught developer who just finished working on an app for controlling Philips Hue via Samsung Galaxy Edge panel. I invite you to beta test it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hzjuu9/i_am_a_selftaught_developer_who_just_finished/)

Hello, my name is Nils Trubkin. I am a self-taught developer who just finished working on an app and would like to invite you to test its beta version.

It is called “Hue edge” and offers the control of the Philips Hue lights system. The app is only compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Edge family of phones, that is all the phones with a curved screen edge. It is a panel that you can add to the Edge panels stack. You can get the beta version from the official Galaxy Store via this link:

[http://apps.samsung.com/betastore/openAppDetail.as?appId=com.nilstrubkin.hueedge](http://apps.samsung.com/betastore/openAppDetail.as?appId=com.nilstrubkin.hueedge)

&amp;#x200B;

[Screenshots of the app](https://preview.redd.it/6xl0dvmv3nd51.png?width=1703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d9fcee2208add48484f0a41dcf2c3b2c1882a3b)

**The app**

Edge panel that contains the main functionality of the app is provided in a similar way to the stock panel with app shortcuts. You can control your Philips Hue lights, rooms, zones, and scenes from here. There are 4 categories and one extra for mixed types of buttons. You can long tap to access brightness, color, and saturation adjustments.

The first start-up is accompanied by a setup guide that searches for the Philips Hue bridge.

The edit mode that lets you organize the buttons with drag-n-drop.

**Feedback**

I am very thankful for any feedback you can provide. You can reach me here, or via [hueedgepanel@gmail.com](mailto:hueedgepanel@gmail.com)

I am mostly interested in the following:

· Did you encounter any bugs, errors or other difficulties using the app?

· Does the app lack some features you would like to see implemented?

· Does the app provide you value for the price of 1$ (one dollar)?

**Technicalities**

Supported down to Android 23, the Samsung SDK sets the limit. Should work up to Android 30. Tested on different screen sizes and should look roughly the same, but if your phone preferences for text size are set to very small it may make the button text hard to read. Supports Hue Bridge 2 (square one) and not tested on the older Hue Bridge (round one).

Source: [https://github.com/nils-trubkin/Hue-Edge](https://github.com/nils-trubkin/Hue-Edge)

**What I learned**

Android Studio IDE, Samsung Slook SDK, threading, executors, callbacks, hash maps, saving to memory, REST requests, layouts, mDNS, UPnP, LAN IP scan, view adapters, animations, and some more.

**Difficulties**

Implementing a full LAN network scan solution was a huge pain given poorly documented APIs on networking. Most solutions online presented code only working for 24 prefix networks, my solution works on any netmask.

**Conclusion**

This app took a good while to create and I am pleased with the result. I hope it brings somebody value and joy to use.
