Since the new Desktop compose framework is jetbrains moving intellij to that platform in the long run. Cutting of ties to the jvm?

First of all, I'm a newbie and I'm not even a programmer. I'm following a Udemy course in order to learn how to get apps done.

So,  simply put I've created a button in a LinearLayout view and set an ID for it but I can't call it in my main activity - it just doesn't show up as I type its id inside the main class. I know Kotlin was supposed to call a view by its id, but why isnt't it working?

Jetpack Compose released for Desktop also 

Now I am thinking about what if it also released with Kotlin multiplatform mobile support?

Any possibility for that ?

https://zal.im/h8/ - Glad they are not using Canvas for rendering the app like in the flutter web. Also, JB Compose team is looking for a Developer to work on Web version of the framework - https://www.jetbrains.com/careers/jobs/ui-framework-developer-400/

## [8][Guides/Tutorials For Kotlin as First Language](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jopbtq/guidestutorials_for_kotlin_as_first_language/)

The majority of guides/tutorials/books I've seen for kotlin seem to assume that you are learning kotlin as a second language (and often that you know Java). Are there any good guides out there for learning Kotlin as a first language?  


I have been considering doing a video series for it if nothing else is available, but if I do that I'm not entirely sure how to go about it. Perhaps I'd take a different book/guide for another language and follow it for Kotlin? Any thoughts/suggestions?

I know it can be tough sometimes when you dont have anyone to check with for help sometimes and well those who know how tend to not want to help but if we learn together we can help eachother out. Want to join me on the path to learning kotlin let me know.
