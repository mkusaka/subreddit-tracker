Can't access [ruby-lang.org](https://ruby-lang.org) due to failed dns lookup. This happening to anyone else.

Hi, I've been developing using Ruby, and I've (in the past) been able to search for base objects (String, Array etc.) using the server.

However, recently, I've been unable to do so - e.g. searching for String doesn't give me any Ruby documentation links. Has anyone else had this problem? 

I currently run Arch Linux, with Ruby 2.7.0.

Edit: I should add - I _am_ able to see documentation links if using ri on the command-line.

Hello

I've just made my first gem! It's a wrapper for an instant search engine API (MeiliSearch). It means indexes, documents, and search handling.  
[https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-ruby](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-ruby)

I love ruby language, it's literally my favorite one, but I use it more with Rails than in this kind of situation.

So, I need your feedback to correct and improve it!

Thanks for your time.

And for the curious ones, here is the repository of our search engine MeiliSearch. We are open-source and we really need your support! ‚≠êÔ∏è Each star and feedback are important for us üôÇ[https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)

Hello everyone, I hope you are well. I'm not sure if it's the best place for such announcements but I was sharing with you my articles for the past 2 years so I decided to write here as I appreciate this community and the value it gives.

I have just finished one of my projects and have more free time now. I thought that I may work with programmers that have fewer experience than me to help them improve the quality of their code or careers as Ruby developers. Does anyone need a consultation, code review or advice? It will be free, maybe in the future, I will think about some kind of compensation in case of a longer partnership but for now, I just wanted to check if there is anyone interested that I could share my knowledge and experience with and see what type of problems do you have.

Short about me:

I ran into a BigDecimal value which has confused the heck out of me.  This is on Ruby 2.6.3

    2.6.3 :007 &gt; BigDecimal("0.08442931")
     =&gt; 0.8442931e-1
    2.6.3 :008 &gt; BigDecimal("0.08442931") - 0.8442931e-1
     =&gt; 0.1e-16

Take note I copied the value from the first line and pasted it to the second.  I otherwise get

    2.6.3 :002 &gt;  BigDecimal("0.08442931") -  BigDecimal("0.08442931")
     =&gt; 0.0

What is going on here?  It doesn't happen often with other values, for example if I change the last digit

    2.6.3 :004 &gt;  BigDecimal("0.08442932") - 0.8442932e-1
     =&gt; 0.0

Any idea what's happening?

Hey guys, I've launched a new Ruby build on YouTube. This is a pretty interesting one as it involves a lot of interaction with the user and handling the user's input from the Terminal. Guess the wrong letter too many times and it's game over. Was a lot of fun writing this code for the video, hopefully it's useful to anyone getting into Ruby.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwGfswwRL4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwGfswwRL4)

As always, I'm planning to post some more Ruby content to my channel to promote the Ruby language, so would be open to suggestions about content ideas. Thanks :)
