After a month of too many hours deep down in this rabbit hole, I finally released
v1 of my eslint config.

**TLDR: Why is this a big deal and imo worth this post?**

It's different from other configs. You can customize it entirely, it imo doesn't ship
with lots of debatable opinions and I made sure, interactions between e.g. prettier
and eslint or typescript-specific rules and other rules are taken care of.

[github](https://github.com/ljosberinn/eslint-config-galex)

try it:

    yarn add -D eslint-config-galex
    
    npm install --save-dev eslint-config-galex


Disclaimer: the following is an excerpt from the readme.

**Setting up ESLint can be easy.**

Plug in someone's config or one of the many "industry standards" and be done
with it. Eventually you learn that some of those practices maybe aren't the best
idea. Too restrictive, treading into Prettier territory, conflicting with other
rules, too opinionated or even outdated, you name it. What to do?

You begin adding `// eslint-disable-next-line rulename-here`. It works, but
litters the code.

You begin disabling rules altogether. Maybe because you don't know better, or
because the rule is actually bad for your situation. You begin to wonder.

You check npm and see there are 2.8k+ (August 2020) `eslint-plugin-*` packages
out there. And even worse - 10k+ `eslint-config-*` packages. Which to choose?
You sort by popularity and see some familiar faces. Time to install!

A few hours into stitching all those popular linting rules together you notice
some rules collide, some rules are outdated, some expect others to be disabled,
but only circumstantially. Enough!

*"Now is the time to finally read through all rulesets and decide which I want!"*
you scream out loud, *"it can't be that many!"* - but find yourself finishing the
first repo after 6 hours.

Setting up ESLint _properly_ wasn't that easy after all.

Couldn't this be easier?

**What makes this different than all the other configs out there?**

All internals, literally everything, is re-exported. Don't like some
  decisions? Rules too weak? Want to add custom rules? Everything is covered!

  This hopefully prevents the need of having to migrate between configs every
  once in a while which builds up frustration due to misconfiguration and the
  entire overhead related to that. Dependency injection, just for an eslint
  config!

**What's included?**

Everything is dynamically included based on your `package.json`.
Rules are selectively applied based on file name patterns.

All rules are commented and link to their docs.

We're using react-hotkeys in production and it's by far the best library that we could find.

https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys

Unfortunately, the developer can't maintain it anymore.  There doesn't seem to be an alternative out there and there are about 9 pull requests.

Unfortunately, he did a 2.0.0 release (which are usually a bit buggy) when he had to stop being a maintainer.

I'm busy with a big release but I can probably devote a bit of time.  What I was thinking is maybe like a half dozen of us can step in and be sort of a group of maintainers.

I'm also that maybe we can ask for donations to help fund someone at least part time to merge PRs and try to fix bugs until this thing is more stable.

Also, if any companies out there is open to fund this with donations I'm sure that would be REALLY appreciated. I think if we can just get it stable first and merge a bunch of PRs we can at least have something where we don't need a full-time maintainer.

Hey,

Developed my first react project that helps you calculate the equivalent amount from fiat money to cryptocurrencies and vice-versa.

Website - [**Pingrates**](https://pingrates.herokuapp.com/) **(** [**https://pingrates.herokuapp.com/**](https://pingrates.herokuapp.com/) **)**

Currently, it supports five cryptocurrencies. Looking to add more later on.

* Bitcoin ( BTC )
* Ethereum (ETH )
* Ripple ( XRP )
* Litecoin ( LTC )
* Bitcoin Cash ( BCH )

Primarily it supports three fiat currencies and many more by using appropriate exchange rates. For all other currencies rates are calculated using USD Rates and Coinbase Forex rates.

* US Dollar ( USD )
* British Pound ( GBP )
* Euro ( EUR )

Currently, it provides live rates from three Exchanges. Working on adding more soon!

* Coinbase
* Bitstamp
* Kraken
