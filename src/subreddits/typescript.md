## [2][Module suffixes problem - VSCode refactoring/servers not using ".js" ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejw340/module_suffixes_problem_vscode_refactoringservers/)

Hi ðŸ‘‹ **Problem**:  I'm using es2015 modules, and targeting web browsers. When I move .ts files in VSCode, the updated module import paths will not have a .js suffix. E.g.: I had a module reference:

* "/js/event.js", upon move to a new directory, the reference was update to 
* "/js/util/event"

In other [VSCode extention](https://github.com/stringham/move-ts.git)s to move and refactor files they also seem to use no suffix. I'm using IIS or the *python -m http.server* command to test my code, and these seem to have no easy way to automatically rewrite all /thing to /thing.js.

What am I missing? The servers don't seem to like the syntax VSCode gives, yet I find no way to change the settings so the refactoring retains the .js suffix. Are modules generated by typescript usually not served as .js? If so, what servers should I be using? 

Sorry for the broad scope of this question, but it's causing me some issues. I've searched for the answer and also tried rewrite rules.

## [5][Top-level await in TS 3.8 Nightly Build?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejgajz/toplevel_await_in_ts_38_nightly_build/)

I'm trying to use top-level await in a TS 3.8. I installed the dev release from today (1/3/20). 

When writing typescript it continues to complain: "'await' expression is only allowed within an async function. (TS1308) when I run tsc.

Am I missing some step to allow top-level await?
## [6][Node CLI startup cache: any other projects like this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejo4ez/node_cli_startup_cache_any_other_projects_like/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejo4ez/node_cli_startup_cache_any_other_projects_like/

I have an idea for a project to improve startup of CLI tools written in TypeScript / JavaScript via aggressive caching and lazy-loading of dependencies, without requiring pre-compilation or webpacking.  The idea is to hit a sweet-spot between CLI performance and developer experience.

* use `bundleDependencies` to lock all dependency versions.
* cache all `require.resolve()` results, all `fs.readFileSync()` related to loading modules
* cache all `ts.transpileModule()` results from `ts-node`.
* A bit of Proxy magic to lazy-load imports automatically, without code changes.
* Include v8-compile-cache

Effectively, code can be written to use ts-node in the simplest way possible.  At development time, this will "just work" without a compile step.  Production releases will automatically create a cache after the first startup.  For subsequent startups, a single cache file is loaded, after which everything is a cache hit in memory.  No more fs calls, no transpiler calls.

Anyone know of a project that already does this?

So far everything I've seen does not take this approach.  They either:

a) bundle it all into a new node binary.  
b) webpack, which can cause weird breakages, incompatibilities, and debugging issues.

Hey -- 

I'm new to Typescript.  

I created this class:

 [https://github.com/NickHodges/TSGuard/blob/master/Guard.ts](https://github.com/NickHodges/TSGuard/blob/master/Guard.ts) 

is this useful in Typescript, or am I wasting my time?

I can, of course, expand on it.

## [9][Generate type aliases from enums](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ej51kk/generate_type_aliases_from_enums/)

    enum Birds {
        eagle,
        cardinal,
        falcon
    }
    
    type BirdTypes = keyof typeof Birds; // 'eagle' | 'cardinal' | 'falcon'

For the longest time Iâ€™ve been duplicating efforts when it came to having both an enum and type alias pointing to the same data, just learned about `typeof` which makes this a lot easier.

Hi! I'm hoping this is the right place I can ask this question. I really like types and have gotten used to using typescript at work. I'm looking to work on a personal project where I generate high quality images programmatically (which in this case means pixel by pixel). Maybe if I actually get this off the ground it'll become clear what I mean.

Anyway, I'm seeing lots of libraries/npm packages online that talk about image manipulation (resizing, overlaying with text, etc) and ones that care about doing this on the web (like canvas). ~~If any of these are good for my use, it seems like it'd be at best by accident.~~ (Edit: To be clear, I don't think these are what I want but they are all I've been able to find.) Anyway, I'd like to be able to generate images that are of high enough quality to print. The point is looking the best over speed. Does anyone know of such a library?

Good typing would be a huge plus in my book.

Thanks so much for any advice!
## [11][Non-null assertion operator vs. Optional chaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ej924r/nonnull_assertion_operator_vs_optional_chaining/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ej924r/nonnull_assertion_operator_vs_optional_chaining/

I was just wondering, is there any difference between the two when you're trying to access properties that may possibly be null or undefined? It seems to me optional chaining is the safer one of the two, though I've yet to use it a lot. I defaulted to using non-null assertion after dealing with async data in GraphQL and only just learned about optional chaining for accessing properties recently.
