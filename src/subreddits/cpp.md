Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

## [6][Updated my "structure of array" wrapper library](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j0aw61/updated_my_structure_of_array_wrapper_library/)

I "recently" created a library that allows you to create an SoA-style vector wrapper around any PoD type: 

[https://github.com/Yamahari/struct\_array](https://github.com/Yamahari/struct_array)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hoabrd/structure\_of\_arrays\_wrapper\_for\_podtypes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hoabrd/structure_of_arrays_wrapper_for_podtypes/)

Now I've updated the lib and added the possibility to customize the maximum "size" of PoDs supported ( the amount of members ) by using horrible macro-magic and adding a "-DSOA\_MAX\_BINDINGS=X" compile definition x). 

Should be ready to use, but I might replace my iterator with one that extends Boost.STLInterface's iterator\_interface in the future.

 Thought this might be useful for everyone doing entry-level socket programming in C++. Currently C++ does not have a unified way to write socket programming for both Windows and Linux. I tried to bridge that gap and write a simple server/client library that can be extended to do more.

The alternatives out there tend to use or depend on external libraries/runtime software which I did not want in my project. Here is what I came up with; feel free to leave feedback and contribute to it:
