## [3][AppBoost is finally here - An open source ad-network for android developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i1o172/appboost_is_finally_here_an_open_source_adnetwork/)

Hi guys am happy to share with you this excitement. I have finally completed the MVP.

AppBoost [https://appboost.org](https://appboost.org) is an adnetwork i have been developing to help android developers promote their apps for free.

It works through cross-promotion, each developer that integrates the ad-network in their app gets other developers apps promoted in his/her app and vice versa. The sdk is currently only available for native apps developed with Java. I will soon release another version for Kotlin as soon as i get validation for it.

The app stores are getting more and more saturated and competitive with thousands of apps being published everyday, Developers and Businesses with little to no budgets are finding it difficult to sustain their app businesses.

**AppBoost** Aims to solve this problem by helping developers and businesses drive traffic to their apps and thereby increase their revenues.¬†

We aim to create a community of developers helping each other succeed in these tough times.

Contributions especially to the website are welcome!

I would be happy to hear your thoughts

Thanks for reading thisüôè

Hi guys! 

I‚Äôm doing a research regarding personality traits of some professionals. Developers are usually required to have a very logical and analytical mindset.   
Do you think the same applies when it comes to personal life, leading to very logical and meaningful conversations, instead of more emotional or small-talk based ones?

Curious to hear your experiences! Thanks!

Hey there!

Please give me perfect sub-reddit if this is not suitable my question below!

I implemented Google authentication in my android app. I use Firebase as server and function. The problem is when I run app from Android Studio, Google authentication works well. But when I upload it to play store , Google authentication fail. It shows 'Authentication failed'.

Stuck here. Can anyone help me?
## [12][My app gets a lot of 1 star reviews from non-English users because they don't understand what it is. Any suggestions on how to avoid this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i15zjt/my_app_gets_a_lot_of_1_star_reviews_from/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i15zjt/my_app_gets_a_lot_of_1_star_reviews_from/

I've been maintaining a moderately successful app over the past few years that most users love. 99% of my English users rate it at 5 stars and say they love it.

But then I have a lot of non-English (mostly Brazilian) users that download the app not fully understanding what it is. So they end up leaving a 1 star review with comments like "worthless" or "garbage." Over time this has gradually lowered my overall rating.

I don't want to limit what countries I make the app available to as I have a lot of non-English users that do understand the app and love it. Plus non-America sales are about 33% of my income.

I'm also hesitant to add a disclaimer in Spanish to my store page because of the impact it may on on SEO.

Can anybody suggest how I might avoid this problem? Thanks for any ideas!

&amp;#x200B;

edit:

Thanks for all the suggestions everybody. I used Google Translate to create a couple localized versions of my store page which includes a giant "YOU CANNOT PLAY GAMES WITH THIS APP". heh

Hopefully that will help people realize what the app is before downloading it!
