Hey guys,

Iâ€™m starting work on a project and had some questions about Auth0, Cognito and the likes. 

I understand that they can provide RBAC. But do I have to manually check and prevent if a particular user can edit a resource? Or can I leverage these services?

For example: I have a REST API `/user/:id ` to which you can POST to update information. How do I ensure that (with a JWT or something) the user logged in can only update resources they have access to?

Lets say I have the following in the comment block (along with the usual params, returns, etc) on a method on an interface,

 `@throws {FooBar} When you do the bad` ,

I get eslint complaining that  FooBar is undefined. The thing is this is an interface - I am not actually throwing FooBar here  - the implementation is separate.

If I import FooBar, eslint stops complaining - now I define FooBar. But now typescript is complaining - I am not actually using FooBar.

How do I get these two idiots to work together?

I came across a TypeScript project called [esfx](https://github.com/esfx/esfx) a few weeks ago and only recently got the time to look closer at what it was. Brought to you by the developer behind the Metadata Reflection API ([`reflect-metadata`](https://github.com/rbuckton/reflect-metadata)) we all know and love, esfx contains a pretty significant assortment of useful constructs.

Treat yourself and take a look. Words cannot describe how extraordinary it is.

## [7][Which language for a blog website: Dart or TypeScript?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jgmmg0/which_language_for_a_blog_website_dart_or/)

&gt; I know this is a biased source. But it's better than not asking...

&gt; [This question was originally posted][original] on r/dartlang.

[My blog][fanaro.com.br] is currently made with WordPress. But I've been wanting to revamp it with a more minimal design and pure code in the backend for quite a while now. The 2 reasons I've been avoiding this were: (1) my own experience as a developer and (2) the technologies I would use. My level of experience with HTML &amp; CSS is ok, but I have only minimal experience with JS and TS. While, with Dart, I think I'm already pretty advanced &amp;mdash; see [this browser extension][youtube_kbd_nav] I've created in the past month.

So I come here to ask if anyone would help me deciding if I could/should go with Dart for revamping my blog website. Is it on par with TS for this purpose? Or should I still go for TS?

From my perspective, most of the website's work will be either content (HTML and text) or the OO design, so, in the end, it wouldn't be too hard to simply rewrite it into another language anyway, though that would be super annoying &amp;mdash; and who knows if I'm gonna accidentally design something that uses a language-specific feature.

There is also Flutter to take into consideration. Even though I think HTML &amp; CSS are more appropriate for this type of static content, maybe Flutter could be the tipping point of the argument for Dart.

Since a blog website is usually very minimal anyway I could use it as an exercise for evaluating the basic differences between Dart and TS. But I don't know if I have the time or energy for that right now.

Hi.

From my Axios request, my [res.data](https://res.data) looks like this: 

    {"count":1,"next":null,"previous":null,"results":[{"id":1,"name":"The Name","url":"http://somewhere"}]}

I'd like represent this response in Typescript, so I've done this:

    import axios, { AxiosResponse } from "axios";
    
    type Results = {
      results: Array&lt;{}&gt;;
    };
    
    type AxiosResponseData = {
      data: Results;
    };
    
    let res = &lt;AxiosResponse&gt; await axios.get(url, config);
    let data = &lt;type.AxiosResponseData&gt;res.data
    return data.results;

Typescript doesn't like the very last line, which this warning: `Property 'results' does not exist on type 'AxiosResponseData'`.

I'd really appreciate help figuring this out.  'AxiosResponseData'.

I've made a NodeJS library called Graceful Server months ago.

You can find it here : [https://github.com/gquittet/graceful-server](https://github.com/gquittet/graceful-server)

and here : [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gquittet/graceful-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gquittet/graceful-server)

&amp;#x200B;

What are its goals?

\- Accept HTTP connections on your API only when it's ready

\- Know precisely why your API crashed and shutdown

\- Close all HTTP connections and disconnect your API from all the data sources on shutdown (to avoid to keep opened ghost connections)

\- Give you a liveness and readiness endpoints (useful when you're using Kubernetes)

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know if the documentation is good.

Can you share idea on how to improve the documentation and features you want to have in this library?

Are you interested that I publish the roadmap?

&amp;#x200B;

This post is to thanks my 10k week downloads ðŸ’ª

Let's make it evolve together ! ðŸš€

Hi, just getting started with typescript. Should I be using a jsconfig or tsconfig, or does it even matter?
## [11][How can I get the keys from a Map.keys() iterator as a type?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jfzkor/how_can_i_get_the_keys_from_a_mapkeys_iterator_as/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jfzkor/how_can_i_get_the_keys_from_a_mapkeys_iterator_as/

```
const entities = new Map&lt;string, []&gt;([
  ["hero", []],
  ["zombies", []],
  ["bullets", []],
  ["text", []],
]);

const mapIter = entities.keys();

for (const keys of mapIter) {
  console.log(keys); // hero, zombies, bullets text
}
```
I want to generate `type EntityKeys = "hero" | "zombies" | "bullets" | "text";` programatically. 

I want to use `entities.get("hero")` and have `"hero"` type-checked, which won't work with `Map&lt;string, []&gt;`. I can use `new Map&lt;EntityKeys, Entity[]&gt;` using `type EntityKeys =...` but then it is not dynamic and I have to create `type EntityKeys` manually.

Cheers!
