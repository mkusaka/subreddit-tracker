Hello i'm noob at Go Lang, but in deep love with Go!  
  
First will start to say i'm trying to learn more about Go and Clean Architecture, because why not?! Also want to said, sorry, because, i know this question time to time pop up over here.  

I'm tired to search on google, youtube and reddit, on every search, got more doubt about Clean Architecture. Have several questions:  
  
 1. Clean Architecture is a real thing or myth? Because what read in go, you are better without it.      
 2. If is real, can any one show a good example, well implemented? With interactor, presenter, etc. Because every article, example i found, can detect right away a bad implementation of Clean Architecture.    
 3. It's true that Robert Martin. (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) is trying selling his ideia?  
 4. In some video saw in other day, Uncle Bob said that Databases is a bad thing in general, and Relation Databases is dying.   
 5. Why Uncle Bob always said bad thing about "SQL"? What and why that bad? I'm like 12 year's of programming and acknowledge that Database is a good thing to have on architecture thing.    

I'm here with open mind, i'm not trying to be bad or anything. Only post here, because is the only place i've know of.  

P.s.: Don't be so hard on me, i'm not english native. So, if you find some typo or incorrect setence, sorry!

Hi fellow gophers,

I have been wanting get my hands dirty with go for a while. Yesterday I decided to build a very simple REST API for checking if an e-mail address is disposable or not. It's not much but I wanted to share the first thing I built with go here ðŸ™ƒ

Has anyone ever gathered a list of most used libraries in go for each task/topic?

I think since go is a relatively new language it is nice to have a list or reference that developers can find the most used libraries for each topic.

I am looking for someone who can help us modify Kolide (opensource osquery manager) and add reporting and alerting to it? More specificly i would like to know how much time this would take?
