I have 8 years of experience. I know all major architectures and libraries. But I've been searching for a job for 9 months and I will honestly work for minimum wage at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

My mind has been going to some pretty bad places and I just want purpose at this point, I'm lowkey starting to get scared...

With the ViewModel component Google has implicitly suggested the MVVM pattern for developing Android apps. Yet I see many developers using different approaches, not all of them fit perfectly in the Android architecture components.

So which pattern do you use and why?

I wanted to create a monthly tax report this morning, as I noticed that for August there is no earning report anymore in the Play Console. It got replaced by a billing report which only contained one entry of Taiwanese tax for me.

There is still the sales report but it contains only the local currency and also misses the google cut. Account activities report in the merchant profile does not give information about  the actual purchases.

I really don't understand why they removed the earnings report. Does anyone know an alternative to the earnings report?

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

When I started developing I was looking for good ideas of things to develop. These ideas, unfortunately would not come up when I had time to develop.

I got an idea that I think I would use but now I do not have the time to develop, in case anyone wants to try and do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Idea**

I would love to have an app that incentivizes or gamifies the act of not unlocking your phone.

I had thought of something simple. For example, starting from the app "Screen Stopwatch" (source code available), from "Google Creative Lab", it counts the time you have been using your phone and shows it in your lock screen and background.

I end up not really looking at the time, but if the time went down while I am not using it I might wait until it goes to zero to start using my phone again.

Additionally, I would add 1 (configurable) minute for every unlock to discourage from unlocking your phone very often.

&amp;#x200B;

**That would be a nice start of an app that I would definitely try.**

&amp;#x200B;

There are other potential improvements but this post would get too long.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

I've published a simple app to automize something I used to do while going to the gym (Counting calories and macros). I'm not planning on making a business out of it but I just want to play around on how I would go about promoting an app once it's released if I ever wanted to. My app is called "Snackr" is on the playstore if anyone is curious. Anyway I don't have much extra money sitting around since I'm a broke college student lol. I published the app around 10 days ago and have around 15 downloads so far without promoting it. I want to start promoting it on Instagram once I add one important feature which would "complete" the app, I'm really unexperienced when it comes to this I have some ideas which I'd love to implement in the upcoming days but I'd love to hear your ideas/opinions as well.

I'm trying to create a list view within a fragment. I tried using my own custom adapter but it kept crashing whenever I try to access a list item's textview inside the adapter. Most resources online use the old-school way with findViewById. I'm trying to only use data binding. Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

NitnemFragment.kt

    class NitnemFragment : Fragment() {
        private lateinit var binding: NitnemFragmentBinding
    
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        }
    
        override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View? {
            binding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater, R.layout.nitnem_fragment, container, false)
            val listItems = arrayListOf("1", "2", "3")
            binding.nitnemListView.adapter = NitnemAdapter(binding.root.context, listItems)
            return binding.root
        }
    }

**NitnemAdapter.kt**

    class NitnemAdapter(val context: Context, val dataSource: ArrayList&lt;String&gt;): BaseAdapter() {
        private val inflater = context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE) as LayoutInflater
    
        override fun getCount(): Int {
            return dataSource.size
        }
    
        override fun getItem(position: Int): Any {
            return dataSource[position]
        }
    
        override fun getItemId(position: Int): Long {
            return position.toLong()
        }
    
        override fun getView(position: Int, convertView: View?, parent: ViewGroup): View {
            val binding = NitnemFragmentBinding.inflate(LayoutInflater.from(parent.context), parent, false)
            val rowView = binding.nitnemListView
            rowView.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLACK)
            val titleTextView = binding.nitnemListView.nitnemTitle
            titleTextView.text = "Testing" // CRASH NULL EXCEPTION
            return rowView
        }
    
    }
