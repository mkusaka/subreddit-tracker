Hi, I just made a very simple note taking web app, it allows you to note quickly and just simple like that. I would like to hear you guys feedback about it:

\- How is your experience of using it

\- What should I do to make it better

## [4][Additive Android/iOS like animations with react-voodoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/inj0ca/additive_androidios_like_animations_with/)

Hi there !

Meet [react-voodoo](https://github.com/react-voodoo/react-voodoo); a fully additive animation engine with impossible features :)

Additive mean we can easily sync complex android/iOS like animations on swipes.

But it have many more cool features like :

* Server Side Rendering of any scroll / swipe position
* Hot switching swipeable anims ( responsive )
* Automatically deal with multiple units using css "calc( ... )"
* Predictive inertia (knowing where inertia will stop after swipe)
* Multitouch dragging ( drag multiple things at once )
* etc

I've made some samples here :

[https://github.com/react-voodoo/react-voodoo-samples](https://github.com/react-voodoo/react-voodoo-samples)

Here a basic android like menu :

[http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/react-voodoo/react-voodoo-samples/blob/master/samples/AndroidMenu/dist/static/index.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/react-voodoo/react-voodoo-samples/blob/master/samples/AndroidMenu/dist/static/index.html)

I'm actively using it in various projects, results are nice :)

stars welcome :)

My first day trying out [Bit.dev](https://Bit.dev) with React projects. I have a file full of functions, many with ES6 syntax that I use across multiple projects. Not only have I not been able to get Bit's babel compile to work yet, but my actual original component source keeps being replaced with a Bit autogenerated file that points to a pre-compiled node\_module. Is this what is meant to happen? How do I keep working on my component?

The auth token returned after logging in is stored on the localstorage of the browser which is sent as Authorization header when making authenticated api requests. However, since there is no localstorage on the server, how would I go about server rendering a page after making an authenticated api request on the server?

I got the number 101 when i first click the button,and when i click second time, the number is 1011 by appending at the end instead of updating the number to 11,12,13....


`this.state={
time:"10",
seconds:"00"
}`
`sessionLength (){
		let time=this.state.time;

		this.setState({time:time
									})
		
	}
	
	sessionIncrement(){
		this.setState({time:this.state.time+1
		})
		
	}
	sessionDecrement(){
		this.setState ({time:this.state.time-1
	})
	}`

Hi I was learning Nodejs and MongoDB earlier and for the frontend side I am using React for my projects. I just discovered firestore and it uses simply Javascript. 

Do firestore can do all backend properties by itself? For developing a web app it is enough to use React  and firebase firestore? I am too confused after discovered firestore, please give me a light...
