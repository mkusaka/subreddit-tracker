Hey folks,

Hope you are doing great. 

I have recently started exploring unit testing. I am a bit confused that what kind of tests should I write.

Example: Counter App has three buttons Increment/Decrement and a Reset button.

Should I write a test that checks whether a display field is present or not, because its obvious that it should be there.

I have written some tests for Counter App. Please have a look at it and let me know if I am going in the right direction  


Note: I am newbie

    describe('Counter', () =&gt; {
      it('renders Counter component without crashing', () =&gt; {
        shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
      });
    
      it('contains a helpful text which explains our App', () =&gt; {
        const title = 'This is a Counter App. Use - button to decrease value and + button to increase value.';
        const wrapper = shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
        expect(wrapper.contains(title)).toBe(true);
      });
    
      it('checks if inc/dec buttons are there', () =&gt; {
        const wrapper = shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
        const incButton = wrapper.find('#increment').dive().text();
        const decButton = wrapper.find('#decrement').dive().text();
        expect(incButton).toEqual('+');
        expect(decButton).toEqual('-');
      });
    
      it('checks if initial value of counter is zero', () =&gt; {
        const wrapper = shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
        const counter = wrapper.find('#counter-input').props().value;
        expect(counter).toBe(0);
      });
    
      it('checks if Increment button increases value by 1', () =&gt; {
        const wrapper = shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
    
        const incButton = wrapper.find('#increment');
        incButton.simulate('click');
    
        const counter = wrapper.find('#counter-input').props().value;
        expect(counter).toBe(1);
      });
    
      it('checks if Decrement button decreases value by 1', () =&gt; {
        const wrapper = shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
    
        const incButton = wrapper.find('#decrement');
        incButton.simulate('click');
    
        const counter = wrapper.find('#counter-input').props().value;
        expect(counter).toBe(-1);
      });
    
      it('checks Reset button functionality', () =&gt; {
        const wrapper = shallow(&lt;Counter /&gt;);
    
        const incButton = wrapper.find('#increment');
        incButton.simulate('click');
    
        const counter = wrapper.find('#counter-input').prop('value');
        expect(counter).toBe(1);
    
        wrapper.find('.reset-btn').simulate('click');
        expect(wrapper.find('#counter-input').prop('value')).toBe(0);
      });
    });

I have studied react js for the past 3 months and got myself convenient in every topic of React as well as its libraries and redux.
I have designed and developed a covid tracker, food delivery app and a shopping app using react. 
Will it be difficult for me to start freelancing in React although if I have a good looking portfolio with my projects hosted on the server for the client to refer ?

Any advice will be appreciated.

How do you usually arrive at estimates? I have always faced backlashes on my gut feel estimates. Do we have any easy/ scientific way of estimating so that gut feel estimates can be more accurate. 


Consider this for a UI application based on react.
## [9][Using React with Parcel.js](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ji9zph/using_react_with_parceljs/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ji9zph/using_react_with_parceljs/
---
So I've been interested in trying out Parcel and finally had some motivation. I've set my project us and I'm having problems with Parcel not reloading and seemingly not watching my files correctly.

I'm not doing anything crazy, I think.. I have a `src` folder with an `index.html` and `index.tsx` and my root `style.scss`. Whenever I save these they are immediately shown in my browser.

Inside src, I have a `components` and `scenes` file. When I import my `Home` component (from the `scenes` directory), this is immediately shown. However, if I make any changes to `Home` or any components in the `components` directory, nothing is ever updated which is really annoying and I can't work out what I'm doing wrong. 

The styles are changes in the components are updated if I stop and start the watcher (`yarn dev`) but otherwise nothing really updates.

Am I doing something wrong with my config?

Hi im currently making a full stack website using the MERN stack. I have a profile component which lets you upload an image and crop it like in twitter but im having trouble on where and how to store it. 

I read something suggesting using base64 but people said that is was slow.  Is there any other alternatives?
