Hello all,

We (the Debian core devs (DDs)) have been facing a lot of problems whilst maintaining Ruby libraries and applications in Ruby. We maintain around 1600 packages in the Debian archive.  
Some of the problems, for example, are using a relative path for `require_relative` calls from specs (tests directory) to the lib directory (`require_relative '../lib/foo'`) and others include using `git` in the gemspec files. And so on..

So we came up with the idea of writing a linter (an extension to RuboCop) for flagging those calls which can be fixed upstream (so a win-win situation for both, Downstream and Upstream!).  
And this is how RuboCop::Packaging (https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging) is born! üíñ

Please give it a look, let me know what you think about it?  
In case you find it good, please give it a ‚≠ê, so the Downstream maintainers know that it was worth it!    
Suggestions and opinions are heartily welcomed! ü§ó

Hello!

I updated my Ruby Regexp book recently, changes include updating to 2.7.1, adding epub/html version, new sections on escape sequences, conditional grouping, `\R`, etc. There's also significant increase in number of exercises and this time I added solutions for reference as well. The entire book can be read online at

https://learnbyexample.github.io/Ruby_Regexp/

Or, you can get free pdf/epub versions from:

* https://gumroad.com/l/rubyregexp
* https://leanpub.com/rubyregexp

I made **all my books free** at the end of March when the pandemic hit my country. And then I spent more than four months to update all my books, this is the last one. You can get all my books as a bundle (Python/Ruby/JS regex and grep/sed/awk cli tools) for free until this weekend:

* https://gumroad.com/l/regex
* https://leanpub.com/b/regex

I‚Äôd highly appreciate your feedback. That‚Äôs been a major motivating factor to keep writing as well as for improving the content.

Happy learning :)

    # before:
    services:
      web:
        volumes:
          - .:/app
    
    # after, notice "cached":
    services:
      web:
        volumes:
          - .:/app:cached

And then re-create container with: 

    docker-compose up web

I've covered some background on this [here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/speed-up-rails-on-docker-on-mac-2c9871c33f63?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ef3e03f93b0a149ddace1022c0565f98), but it's essentially that simple.

I recently gave some thought into how I've _broken_ the single responsibiltiy principle throughout my career as a software engineer and came up with an interesting analogy using a pencil.
