2 years ago i started working on a project, to help people learn Vim in an entertaining way. The game has its own small game engine that handles the input events and draws the entities on the terminal using [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go).

The project came to a point where it's useful, but not complete. Lots of new levels could be added to teach more features of Vim. I'm wondering if anybody would like involve in such a project and contribute, or just give some motivation!

I've been kinda wondering, is serving secure HTTPS connection in Go as simple as using `http.ListenAndServeTLS()` with a valid certificate or am I missing something? And if I am then what do you need to do?

We have a bunch of microservices and in each microservice we have a db layer and a service layer. We write our endpoints in service layer. We handle our errors in db layer and map it to some error code so that in service layer we can return a response code corresponding to the error code encountered in db layer (we maintain a map of error codes to response codes). Is it a good practice? I would love to know what approaches do you guys use? Thank you.
