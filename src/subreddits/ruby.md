Right, so I am trying to customise my receipt on Stripe website, they have [a template](https://stripe.com/docs/recipes/sending-custom-email-receipts) to make this but I am stuck in following lines,

By the way, I successfully installed Ruby, Rubygems and Sinatra framework as they seemed to be needed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and when i request the first line, it gives me an error, saying

[https://www.openbsd.org/papers/httpd-asiabsdcon2015.pdf](https://www.openbsd.org/papers/httpd-asiabsdcon2015.pdf) \-- is this possible? If so, are there anybody here I could hire to help me set up a working config?

I want to prove to the world that it is indeed possible to combine the greatest programming language and web framework ever made with the simplest, most secure web server ever made.

So far all I got to go on is that it \_\_might\_\_ be possible using [Rack::Handler:FastCGI](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rack/Rack/Handler/FastCGI)?

Hey, Folks.

I want to preface this with saying that I use Ruby, and will likely continue to do so until it's killed or I find something better.  For my own use, I don't really care if it's dying or not.

The real reason I'm asking is because I've been slowly trying to convince my team to try it out for some of our projects.  While I think it's a great language, I would really hate to steer them in a bad direction and make it harder to find devs because everyone is off learning the hip, cool languages like Go (or god-forbid, JavaScript).

So, in your experience, have you noticed any significant decrease in Ruby job postings or things along those lines?
