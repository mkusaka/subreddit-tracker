This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

EasyRate is an Android library for dealing with app ratings &amp; feedbacks. In simple words, it shows a modern and well-designed dialog to engage users to rate your app on the Google Play Store.

I am thinking of writing an article on Medium about an Android app I rearchitected using a Redux-like data store. I have never written for Medium but I have read a lot of Android articles about development. 

Do you have any advice on writing such an article?

Hello Android Dev community!

I'm working on a basic app for community improvement that requires end users submit the following:

\-  picture (taken on the spot with Android device)

\- a dropdown field selection

\- a simple text field

\- location using the Google Maps API

What is the easiest method for capturing this data in a database and displaying in an easily digestible way?

I was thinking of connecting the fields to a service such as Knack or Zoho but wanted to get the opinion of someone well-versed in Android app development.

Thank you!
