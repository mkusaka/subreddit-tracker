Having a bit of trouble at work with a code review that's gone a bit weird.

Basically, this is the top-level export of a package we have. The package is an "api client" that knows how to communicate with our API endpoints

First thing i did was remove the Promise. Remember this module is the top-level module in the package. It is set as the "main" field in \`package.json\`

Removing the promise has set off a bit of disagreement.

I'm trying not to lead the responses here but do any people see the problem with exporting promises as top-level package exports?



    const Datasources = {
        B: 'baby',
        A: 'arsenal',
        C: 'cast'
    };
    
    export default {
        getDatasource(datasource) {
            switch (datasource) {
            case Datasources.A:
                return Promise.resolve(new A());
    
            case Datasources.B:
                return Promise.resolve(new B());
    
            case Datasources.C:
                return Promise.resolve(new C());
    
            default:
                return Promise.reject(new Error(`Unknown datasource: ${datasource}`));
            }
        }
    };
