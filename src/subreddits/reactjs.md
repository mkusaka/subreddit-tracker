[**simple-react-state**](https://github.com/yezyilomo/simple-react-state) is a react state manager based on react hooks and react-redux which  makes working with both local and global state painless, it  also works pretty well with nested states. With [**simple-react-state**](https://github.com/yezyilomo/simple-react-state) you can manage state in your react application with only 4 utilities, `Provider`, `configureStore`, `useLocalState` and `useGlobalState` that's all you need. Here is the link to the project [https://github.com/yezyilomo/simple-react-state](https://github.com/yezyilomo/simple-react-state), Your opinions will be appreciated, Thank you.

Ran a bunch of tests on App.js and I am wondering if there are any other test I can run on it. I am pretty sure there are tons and tons, but I would like to know if there's any test worth doing.

i'm an amateur and this is probably a dumb question, but i am trying to access my locally created 'create-react-app' from another computer on the same Wifi. i looked at this stack overflow question which asked a similar thing: 

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47412363/how-to-open-a-create-react-app-from-another-computer-connected-to-the-same-netwo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47412363/how-to-open-a-create-react-app-from-another-computer-connected-to-the-same-netwo) 

but when i run  HOST=0.0.0.0 npm run start, i get an error message saying: 

"'HOST' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

how do i get past this, and is there any other way of testing my create-react-app on another computer other than my local one? 

&amp;#x200B;

thanks a lot everyone!

Any suggestions on simple light weight library that has a component similar to Flatlist or ScrollView in React Native? I have to render a list in a small pop up box on a SPA.

Hi! I'm working on a career change to coding and I've been learning React, among other things. I made this mortgage calculator and I wanted to show it off, simple as it is.

I used test-driven development principles with Jest and Enzyme to write the logic and interface, and then tried to get the app as responsive as I could figure out with CSS.

I have some ideas for further enhancements...I mean, I could hardly sneeze without enhancing it because it's so bare-bones simple. One thing I'd like to do is eventually port it to React Native and Electron. But I'm interested in other ideas.

Also, I'd appreciate any feedback on how close this is to a viable portfolio project. Thanks for taking a look and for any advice!

Hi all! I originally created a GitHub issue on the facebook/react repo for this question, but they suggested I ask this question here.

So my React application has a list of to do lists like this:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12554095/71749785-47206c00-2e2b-11ea-8d0c-5a82ceba1b05.png

\&gt; Replace the Figma canvas preview images with todo lists above.

&amp;#x200B;

In the list of todo lists, I'd like to include a preview of each list as well as its name.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I thought of to achieve this:

\- Whenever a todo list is updated, run a AWS Lambda (Node.js environment) job which generates HTML for the todo list server-side (using \`ReactDOMServer.renderStaticMarkup\`.

\- Then, serve that HTML locally, visit the page using puppeteer, and take a screenshot of the page

&amp;#x200B;

However, this seems like a lot of work. Is there an easier way of achieving this? Is there anything in the steps above that won't work?

I've looked at \`repng\` \[1\] so far but it hasn't worked for the components I tested it with.
