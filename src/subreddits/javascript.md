This is tough topic because JS is a spec and implementations, both of which are continuously changing/improving.  So maybe it's helpful to narrow this down somewhat: V8 engine.  What's out there as far as best of breed books, blogs, videos or courses.  Google turns up some, but it's difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.
