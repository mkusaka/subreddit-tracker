So I'm currently working on a small project to learn how to write a very basic livestream video player using DASH from the Instagram API. I'm running out of resources to use and it's still not working (I feel like I'm pretty close though), so I'm wondering if there's something more out there that I can read upon to further understand the concept of dash/livestream. I'm currently struggling to get the video to play. Downloading the mpd and the audio/video chunks, buffering them, etc. is all working.

Does anyone recommended any material I can read upon?

Or maybe even better, if there's someone on here that has (extended) knowledge about this subject and has time to answer some questions I'd greatly appreciate that.

Hi all,  
I work as an instructor in a prison helping to deliver a coding curriculum to inmates. Unfortunately, prison regimes are heavily reduced and the class is currently no longer running due to the Corona pandemic.   


We're looking to give the guys some material to keep them busy and learning. Problem is, they have no access to a laptop/tablet etc. so everything for the time being must be purely paper based. 

The curriculum is fairly self led, and begins with HTML and CSS before moving on to JavaScript, with later stages being more open to individual preferences and specialisation. For the time being, everyone is operating within the HTML/CSS/JS part of the curriculum.   


We're looking for good reading material, and offline exercises we can give them, be it wireframing, psuedo-code sort of stuff, or looking at general programming principles and best practices. 

Anyone aware of good material that fits within the offline limitations?

Thanks!
