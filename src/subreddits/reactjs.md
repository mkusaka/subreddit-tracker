## [3][Last week I posted about trading design mentorship for react mentorship. I received a ton of DMs which got me thinking...is there an opportunity for a community here?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f06uh5/last_week_i_posted_about_trading_design/)

Basically....are there other areas of expertise that you would like to grow in that you would trade your time for? This might be a crazy example, but would you trade time for someone who wanted to learn singing? What about illustration? Or video editing? Or maybe a specific tool like Figma or Lightroom?

Basically...it got me thinking about the idea of trading mentorship. Maybe there‚Äôs enough people out there who would want to trade their time mentoring in exchange for someone else helping them grow in an area they are curious about...

Hi all!

I just published a new version of my library [simple-graphql-to-typescript](https://sgts.netlify.com/)

The goal is to avoid you from writing GraphQL queries by hand and accelerate development of your front-end apps.

Here is an exemple with the free GraphQL Api \`json-placeholder\`:

```bash
sgts --endpoint https://json-placeholder-graphql.herokuapp.com/graphql --codegen-react-hooks --output ./generated.ts
```

And how to use in your code (Taken from docs):

```ts
import { usePost } from '~/generated.ts'; 

const Hello = () =&gt; { 
   const { loading, error, data } = usePost(`id title`, { id: 5 }); 
   if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading ...&lt;/p&gt;; 
   return &lt;h1&gt;Hello {data.posts.title}!&lt;/h1&gt;; 
};
```

This package also generate all your types, enums and queries args types.
It's now very mature, and all devs are using it in my agency.

Don't hesitate to give me feedback! :)

Hello, I'm trying to get up to date with all the new techs in 2020, and I was wonder:

**Which it will be the "quickest way" of making an full React app + API with the typical CRUD actions** with the tools and the scaffolding we have nowadays.

The options I found it's using  [https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) for front and Firebase/AirTable or Loopback as data providers (It's just for CRUD actions).

Or maybe using something like  [https://scaffoldhub.io/](https://scaffoldhub.io/) and build the API from scratch in Node.js or Swagger or .NetCore.

So what do you think it will be the quickest way to get from the Model to a full app with persistent data in server ?
