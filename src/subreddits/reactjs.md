I'm gonna be completely honest with you - I'm asking because i'm terrible with finishing projects and straight out lazy.

I feel like I have a strong motivation to do current project and would want to make it PWA, but I also know myself that if the basics are done and I start to struggle/get annoyed with \*NEW\_THING\_THAT\_I\_WANT\_TO\_TRY\* i drop the project.

I suppose solution would be completing the project AND THEN making it into PWA, because "hey, it's almost finished, might as well go the extra mile, push myself and just do it".

So how easy/hard/time consumig would that be? Does that require a lot of code refactoring?
## [5][Wondering about a good structure of Redux state in a workout tracking app](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ezqked/wondering_about_a_good_structure_of_redux_state/)

Hi!

I am currently starting to build a TypeScript React Redux app designed to track workouts. User should be able to choose a day (from a menu) and see workout routine for this day. Workout routine consists of multiple exercises. Exercise consists of name (user can input his own name), number of repetitions and weight used. Everything will be saved and synced with localStorage.

I am wondering about a good structure of Redux state in this app. I think it should look something like:

State:

    day: number // currently chosen day
    
    Exercise: { // collection of exercises 
        id: number;
        name: string;
    }
    
    ExerciseResult: {
        exerciseId: number;
        repCount: number;
        repWeight: number;
    }
    
    WorkoutRoutine: {
        id: number;
        day: number;
        results: ExerciseResult[]; // array of ExerciseResult
    }

My idea is that user switches the day (state variable *day* changes), components get reloaded and fetch new WorkoutRoutine with correct *day* variable and then correct data is shown.

Is this a good design? Any ideas or criticisms? And in general, are there any resources which would guide me on how to design state, or is it just something that comes with experience?

Thanks!
## [6][How do you use the animation library from microsoft UI Fabric](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ezk2kf/how_do_you_use_the_animation_library_from/)

I've got a little CRUD app and I've decided to use microsoft UI Fabric instead of bootstrap. The layouts are done, react components and everything is working fine, but, because of the data fetching from the server I want to animate some components when they're loaded.

'ms-ui-fabric' has a [page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/web/motion) dedicated to the animation/motion section but it's just the overview, no code samples. I've been looking online and happen to find a fabric UI package "[@fabricui/fluent-theme](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/tree/master/packages/fluent-theme)" that allows you to animate, but still the documentation doesn't tell you how.

Has anyone used fabric UI or knows how to animate components using fabricUI?

I would like to know your opinion on [react-tiger-transition](https://github.com/pedrobern/react-tiger-transition).

This package provides full page transitions with react-router and react-transition-group.

Here is the [demo/documentation](https://pedrobern.github.io/react-tiger-transition/) site.

I'm the package author and would like to know what can be improved and what is missing. Everybody is invited to make it better by contributing.

I know, I know. Yet another one of these comparisons! Bear with me. I'm pulling data from a variety of APIs and structuring the data in my own postgres database, and I have a couple of options:

\- Use Gatsby and go "all static", which has the advantage of low production costs, vibrant plug-in ecosystem, but doesn't support AMP as first-party, which is really important for what I'm doing. So it'd be hacky. Plus, build times would likely take a very long-time, which isn't a deal-breaker.

\- Use Next.js to create the pages uses SSR, which has first class support for AMP, but since it is SSR it's inherently slower than static AND, I assume, production costs would be quite a bit more expensive (having a large, hosted postgres database always on and tapped into). On the other the hand, I don't have to worry about lengthy build processes--and truthfully I have no idea how long it would take to build several hundred thousand static pages, though the content would be minimal and it would only need to be done every day or so.

Out of curiosity, is the expense calculation correct? Would it cost quite a bit more to serve via Next.js and SRR instead of a simple (but large) set of static pages?

Any advice would be appreciated!
