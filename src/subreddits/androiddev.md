This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I'm using the "The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course - Build 23 Apps!" course on Udemy to learn to make apps; never done anything like this before so I'm as green as can be.

The program I'm using is Android Studio.

I'm stuck because of the errors in the image, and this is before I've even started using it. I'm using version 3.0.1 as that's the version in the course, and I was advised that "The errors on the original version will have taken you through the issue  and provided links to what needed updating..." but I don't see how to do that.

Can anyone assist with the errors so I can hopefully start using this and learning?
