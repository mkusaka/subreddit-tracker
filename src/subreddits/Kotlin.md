**What is it?**

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (Kotlin, Java, Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Python,..).

**Motivation**

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.

**PS**

I trained the Kotlin model on LeakCanary.

Hi everyone!

I’m a really big fan of Kotlin and I’m, fascinated by the idea of using [Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform aka KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) for sharing code between mobile platforms. Why do we keep on doing fully native applications while it is possible to share code and keep UI native (IMHO the only part that should remain native)?I was spreading this idea around Android and iOS teams. And it was quite contagious, not as coronavirus but still all of my Android teammates are ready to try KMM in our project and even some of the iOS mates want to try too.But here we come to the problem – our manager Rick. He is old school and does not trust new trends in development, he is the type of person who would start using KMM only after Facebook is rewritten to KMM. 

As I understand from [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile goes Alpha blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-goes-alpha/?_ga=2.254447435.290197248.1604915804-1660784246.1601558560) and [Kotlin 1.4 online event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW-jkOLucjM) the Kotlin team is promoting KMM as a technology that is ready for production. They have got a [series of case studies about KMM used in production](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/case-studies/) on their KMM portal. All of these efforts should make developers and managers believe that KMM is ok ready to be used. But despite many advantages that it brings to a project many developers and managers (like our Rick) are still doubt its usage and wait some more time to understand if there are there any underwater rocks in these technologies.

So may you answer a simple question: Is it ready for production or not?

Feel free to share your experience and thoughts.
