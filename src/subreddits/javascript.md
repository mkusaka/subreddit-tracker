It seems lots of devs prefer TS over JavaScript. But I still like JavaScript as it is, it is not perfect but nice. If I need types I would go with Flow or Hegel.  I will stay with JavaScript until Wasm takes over, so I could write front-ends using Rust ([Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew), [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed)).
