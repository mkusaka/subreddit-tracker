We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi there, fairly new to React. I'm curious to what design patterns people use when calling a single api to get some data for a page. For example I have a route `/pages/list`. I need to call the API `get_pages` on mount to populate the data of a list.

Is it really necessary to use a loading indicator for this? I would like to just transition to the page naturally like a traditional website does. How would I achieve this? I considered:

1. Calling the API before calling the route but if there is a delay the UI will just do nothing and the user will be confused. I noticed on a traditional website there is a loading bar in the browser. Is it possible to use this with react?
2. First route and render null, then call the api and render on success, this has the disadvantage that the user sees a blank page.

What are your thoughts?

Reading Next.js docs, I came across this part, which I can't understand. Can anyone explain why the parameter of the function is inside an object?

    function Layout({ children }) { 
        return &lt;div&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt; 
    } 
    export default Layout

I'm having the error in the title, as [shown here](https://imgur.com/a/dZSTXNL). I have zero clues as to what it means. I do have the CORS extension enabled, after all, as can be seen in the same screenshot. [Here's my code](https://pastebin.com/sei11i7X), if it helps. I'm COMPLETELY LOST as to why this is happening, and my job is threatened by this bullshit.

Hey, Iâ€™m stuck with an issue which Iâ€™m unable to resolve.
Iâ€™m working on a webapp whose one of the routes would be of the format 
webappName.ai/?invite_code=value&amp;fireside=yes

From this I have to capture the invite_code in localStorage.

How do you do this?

I'm taking a udemy course on react, after learning the basics(props, state,...) I want to build a small project. I was wondering what was your first project when you started?
