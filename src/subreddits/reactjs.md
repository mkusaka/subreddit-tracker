We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

My [friend](https://www.reddit.com/user/srinskit) and I have built a web app where you can explore and migrate your song collection across different music services.

Services currently integrated

1. Amazon Music India
2. Spotify

The codebase is three parts

1. [Web app](https://github.com/shreyasseshadri/potential-invention/tree/master/webapp)
2. [Browser extensions (Chrome and Firefox](https://github.com/shreyasseshadri/potential-invention/tree/master/extensions)[) for Amazon integration](https://github.com/shreyasseshadri/potential-invention/tree/master/extensions)
3. [Backend](https://github.com/shreyasseshadri/music_jump)

Contributions are welcome for integrating new services and helping out with issues in the repo.

Have been testing the new react router (6.0.0-beta.0) and I couldn't manage to make optional parameters to work. This was working in 5.2.0 path="/:lang?" and now it doesn't. Has something changed?

Does any one have idea about the best open source react wizard / steps plugin available with step validation and vertical steps as I couldn't find one. I use [bs-stepper](https://johann-s.github.io/bs-stepper/) in HTML version and need similar in React.

Hi folks, I have been practicing React.js for a while and tried to figure out to implement a Global Error Handling that would catch all errors that might occur in the entire app. 

As you know, `componentDidCatch` lifecycle hook cannot catch the errors that are occurred in an async operation. There might be a case that there is an async operation which you forgot to handle or don't want to handle manually but you still don't want to show the ugly error screen to the user, To solve this problem, I came up with listening to `window.onunhandledrejection` in the `ErrorBoundary` component. My concern is, that if it is, someway, a bad practice to listen to this particular event in React, or generally in any JS app. Is there any disadvantage of listening to it?

Any thoughts?
