Hi there. Trying to display hello world on my homepage to make sure my app is going to run properly. I was able to get to the Rails welcome page, but as soon as I created the first controller for the homepage I'm getting this error output:

My eyes go to those "Possible causes" it lists, but I'm not sure if that's it because I also see the Webpacker compilation failed above that. Also the error Command "webpack" not found. It's like it has multiple reasons for this error and I'm just not sure how to fix this. Any help is greatly appreciated. I made a github repo  [here](https://github.com/Kyle-Williamson-Dev/CanaBnb)

Hi there. I've been having issues just getting things going with Rails and Docker. I'm getting the following output after following basically everything in the Docker-compose quickstart guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/).

Looks like the first thing I see is the web\_1 line that says exec: rails: not found. Tried Googling and can't find a solution that works. I've had this working before on my portfolio, but then I merged some changes someone was trying to help with and that got all messed up. So I'm just trying to create one of my projects FOR my portfolio just to start fresh with a Rails app to try again. I'll post the outcome below as well as my dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

If you need more than this to help, just let me know. I've been stuck on docker issues for a long time now just trying to get going after graduating bootcamp in February. Thing is I got my portfolio app working before and just decided to try a change (can't recall for the life of me what that change was) that messed everything up. I'm still so new to this and especially new to Docker. Thank you in advance.

I am running a Debian 10 (Buster) Server for my Rails 6.0.3, Ruby  2.6.3, Mina 1.2.3 app. When I run Mina deploy it errors out but does not  give me enough to help me understand what I need to do to resolve the  issue.

I have made sure that yarn is installed and working on my Production  machine. When I run the precompile on the Production machine, it runs  through successfully. But still errors out in the Mina Deploy with no  change in the error text. I have looked into [this article](https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina/blob/master/docs/faq.md#--my_program-not-found-but-is-already-installed)   In doing so I have commented out the suggested code snippet just to  test, but that did not change anything. In looking at my bashrc, I do  not see any snippets with EXPORT or SOURCE at the beginning of them.

Briefly , I stumble on a stackoverflow comment which he says to have always at most 2 resources nested levels. He didn't explain much and I'm trying to figure out how would be the difference doing

`resources :x do`

`resources :y` 

`end`

`resources :y do`

   `resources :z`

`end`

 instead 

`resources :x do`

`resources :y do`

`resources :z`

`end`

`end`

I have a ToDo App which has a TodoItem resources nested in TodoList resources. Today I naively tried to nested these resources into my User resources. I spent a few hours solving the routing paths in my views and at end I stumble on a issue with forms. The paths were long and confusing.

I would like to understand technically the difference between the first and the second way of dealing with nested resources.

How to log exceptions using Lograge as default logger.

Basically, I am using Lograge as the default Rails logger that reduces the bulk of rails logs to formatted structure. But exceptions are not included by default. In the lograge configuration I included the following,

`opts[:exception]Â = event.payload[:exception]Â if event.payload[:exception]`  
`opts[:exceptionObject]Â = event.payload[:exception_object]Â if event.payload[:exception_object]`

This seem to pring the first like in code exceptions. It also does STDOUT and so i have the exceotions being logged normally with stacktrace. This does not include routing exceptions.

Is there a way I can get the exceptions logged as part of lograge output, with appropriate status, backtrace and not duplicate the exception once again?
