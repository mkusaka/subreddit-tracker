The 11.11 release is now mobile-compatible, meaning existing FXGL games can be compiled to Android (if you have Linux) and iOS (if you have Mac OS).

Sample games (a few of which are in Kotlin) and instructions are available at [FXGLGames](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames#build-for-mobile) As this is the first stable build, the process will be refined in future releases, based on feedback.

Breakout on Android demo can be seen in the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1304731964323307520)

Whilst the demo used is written in Java, FXGL DSL and API try to be nice to both Java and Kotlin devs. So you can write Kotlin only, Java only, or Java-Kotlin hybrid source games.

Should you wish to explore the FXGL engine's sources, most of the internals are written in Kotlin: [GitHub](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) where you can also report any issues.

Thanks for checking out!

I'm learning kotlin and I'm currently trying to generate a random math problem (consisting of two random integers for the operands and a random operator). This is what I have so far:

    var num1 = 0
    var num2 = 0
    var operator: String? = null


    fun main(){


    }
    fun generateRanNumAndAnswer(a: Int?, b: Int?){
        when(operator){

        }
    }

I'm really stuck though. I know that using switch-case statements can't be used here, rather I should be using a when statement. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
