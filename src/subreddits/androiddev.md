This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

I have converted my android-showcase project to use. Now I am running UI tests on Android emulators and I have an infinite number of parallel executors.

Here is the full workflow config for GitHub Actions

## [10][Will an update APK also update the internal SQLite database?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/h86vu5/will_an_update_apk_also_update_the_internal/)

If I have an app built running on an SQLite database (everything is completely offline). 

If I then release an update, with changes to the database, will that also be updated or does the user need to uninstall and reinstall the app to see the database changes?

Changes can include new columns and more entries to the database.
