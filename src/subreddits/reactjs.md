We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello everyone. So i am trying to import events from my google calendar and everything seems to be okay except for the events that are one day only for example independence day. It's 4th of july and it shows like: 4th of july-5th of july. So the question is how can I check if the event is one day only or is there any other way to fix this issue? thanks a lot!

I know there are thousands of personal projects that don't involve cloning an existent website. However from the feedback I have been receiving from recruiters, making a clone is very helpful as they immediately understand what the project is when they read the title.

Hi,

I've heard a lot of good things about Next.js, tried it for a pet project, and liked the overall developer experience. I haven't used it for anything big though; and now, when considering migration of a fairly large and growing project from vanilla React over to Next, I would love to hear about your experience with it and whether there are any caveats that you've discovered and would like to share. Like, isn't the file-based routing giving you troubles? Do you use Next's `/api` routes, are you upset that they can only exist under the `/api` namespace, and have you been bitten by the fact that Next automatically parses request body (as discussed [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/11036))? Are you happy with your choice or would you have chosen different tools/frameworks/tech stack if given another chance?

Hi,

I am doing a project with pure Javascript I stuck at the moment when pushed items are not shown on the page.

&amp;#x200B;

[See the pic here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HAiVxqFlVKnf66swaAthHgy06fRe7PT1/view?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the picture, items should be shown above after being clicked (pushed to `answer` array), with react it is simple vy using setState, how can I achieve the same with javascript.

Please pay attention to these ones.

`const answerÂ =Â [];`

`&lt;divÂ class="answer-field"&gt;${answer.map((ans)Â =&gt;Â (\&lt;buttonÂ value=${ans}Â class="word"&gt;${ans}&lt;/button&gt;\`Â Â Â Â )).join('Â ')}Â Â &lt;/div&gt;\``

`word.forEach(item =&gt; item.addEventListener('click',Â (e)Â =&gt;Â {answerFunc(e.target.value);console.log(e.target.value);}))`

&amp;#x200B;

//Entire code

 

`const boardÂ =Â document.querySelector('.board');`  
`const ttsÂ =Â window.speechSynthesis;`

At first, I use Reactjs to build app, but soon I recognize that CSR is not good for SEO, so I convert them to Nextjs, just a few adjustments, the SEO increase significantly. With this tool, you can easily generate your app icons in just 1 or 2 seconds.
## [12][Web-worker issue: Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iv2uzu/webworker_issue_uncaught_domexception_failed_to/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iv2uzu/webworker_issue_uncaught_domexception_failed_to/

Hi,

I have a barchart made with chartjs in a React app. It works well, but the data parsing could be handled by a web worker so as to speed up the page loading.

I have declared my web worker in a useEffect function:

      let data = React.useRef([]);
    
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const dataWorker: Worker = new Worker("./worker.ts");
        dataWorker.postMessage({
          msg: "formatData",
          data: { series, theme, range },
        });
        dataWorker.onmessage = (e: MessageEvent) =&gt; {
          if (e &amp;&amp; e.data) {
            data.current = e.data;
          }
        };
      }, [range, series, theme]);

And the webworker is defined in a separate file worker.ts:

    self.onmessage = async (e) =&gt; {
      if (e &amp;&amp; e.data &amp;&amp; e.data.msg === "formatData") {
        const { sortedSeries, theme, range } = e.data;
        // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
        const data = useFormatData(sortedSeries, theme, range);
        self.postMessage(data);
      }
    };
    
    function useFormatData(series, theme, range) {
      return useMemo(() =&gt; {
       // do stuff
        };
      }, [range, sortedSeries, theme]);
    }

The worker makes the page crash with the following error:

&gt;Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker: function (number) { var b = number % 10, output = toInt((number...... } could not be cloned.

How to fix this? Thanks!
