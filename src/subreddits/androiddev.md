* How do I pass data between my Activities?

I'm trying to write an android time machine app, but the 32 bit unix calendar won't go past 19 January 2038 - and it only gives a time range of approx. 136 years! Will all android devices run a 64 bit version by 2038?

Hi,

Is there a way of implementing secure local authentication using app-specific PIN, that is resistant to runtime tampering?

Android developers page, as well as OWASP MSTG, recommend using either of the following:

1. Confirm Credential - this uses the device lock screen credentials (PIN/password/pattern) to unlock the Keystore.
2. Biometric

There seems to be no option of integrating KeyStore unlock using an app-specific PIN, so I'm having a hard time thinking of how to implement this securely. Without integrating with a cryptographic primitive from the KeyStore, any verification logic I implement in the app's business logic is susceptible to runtime tampering via a debugger/Frida script that simply modifies the return value to true.

hey.   
im a cs student and i want to learn android dev when i have some spare time.   
i have various reasons for that but the main two i guess is having some experience in dev stuff &amp; managing to get a student dev job. i understood if you want higher chances of getting a student job in IT a project can really help so i chose android dev.      
i got 2 options right now, both of them are udemy courses. keep in mind i know some java from uni.         
the first option is an android dev course where you learn to do it with java, and with some kotlin (i guess its 75%/25% to java.)        
the second option is a flutter course, which from what i understand is in a language called dart. that way i could also make IOS apps.     
any opinions on what i should go for?

Two of my app is has got an AdMob unsupported language policy violation. 

As per our Program policies, publishers are not permitted to place AdSense code on pages, or AdMob code in apps, with content primarily in an unsupported language. This policy is in place in order to ensure the best possible experience for our users as well as our advertisers. Review more information here:

* [Unsupported languages](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9727) (AdSense)
* [Unsupported languages](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2784738) (AdMob)

The  first app is quotes in unsupported language. 

The second app is language lesson between English and one  unsupported language.   


I will appeal for the language learning app, but what is my solution for the quotes app?
