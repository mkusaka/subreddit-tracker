Hi guys!  


I've learned coding and game dev a bit during lockdown, and build my first android game. This is a number puzzle, so similar genre to 2048.   
If you have time, can you please provide feedback or suggestions for improvement?   
I'm enjoying the process a lot, so would like to keek going and making my apps and games better each time :)

The link to the source code below. I used Godot game engine.   
I was terrible with commenting the code, sorry for that!

What are the typical pay rates for including audio ads in your app?

Did anyone integrate the maps sdk v 3 yet? What are your observations? I find it a little less snappy to load (tiles take longer to load), but the zoom animations and move animations seem more responsive.

There is a mismatch between Active users count in Google Play console and Firebase console.

I  can see 10k active users (30 days average) on Google play console but only 3.1k active users on firebase console.

Really appreciate if someone explains what this difference meant.

Hello, I'm not sure if it's deserve post of it's own, but I'll take my chances.

I know Android, and I wrote several apps with java&amp; Kotlin, but I have serious problem of writing "good code".

What I mean by that - I know the principal of oop - polymorphism, inheritance etc etc but I have hard to implement this in Android development.

For example - instead of writing every api call  if check wether to show progress bar or not, write an interface that will handle automatically this check and will inflate the layout by that.

Or generic response handling etc etc...

My question is - there is online course that focus on this topics?

All I found is just hardcore java with gui, or hardcore Android that not focus on this topic
## [11][Video Compression on Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gs35ea/video_compression_on_android/)

Hey guys, I want to resize videos to a specific resolution (and sometimes even convert landscape videos to portrait using letterboxing). I checked out a few libraries which were using MediaCodec and also [this](https://github.com/tanersener/mobile-ffmpeg) library which uses FFMPEG. Scaling down a 3 minute 1080p video to 480p takes upwards of 1 minute in all of them.

Is there any way to reduce this time? If any native library doesn't provide a significant speed improvement over FFMPEG, I am leaning towards using the latter.

Also, are there any FFMPEG flags which reduce the processing time? I checked the logs and my speed hovers around 2x - 2.2x when compressing the video.

Suspect this is only true because of Flutter.
