 I'm wondering if there's library that would make it easier to make map similiar to the linked one. I thought of leaflet.js but I think I    wouldn't be able to code it in the way the Netflix map is made there (I    never used it tho, might be wrong). I know that   "Anyone know a library that does \_\_\_?"  questions are forbidden but I know a lot of interactive map libraries and I don't think it's possible to achieve similiar result with them.
