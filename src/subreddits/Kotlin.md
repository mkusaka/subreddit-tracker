I need a little bit guidance for a app project

It will start with a log screen where the users need to register a username and a password although the username is a specific number already known by the user, so they just need to register a password. Then when a specific user (identified by the user's number) logs into the user interface it will display a name from a database on Firebird.

The user's number and name is already in the database on Firebase


I just need some guidance on what I need to research about. I just started with Kotlin yesterday.

Thanks (:
## [6][(kotlin) The FIRST source code file that is read whenever an app is started is "MainActvity" inside "java" folder right? Then what's the next source code file that it reads and wha'ts the entire "order of execution" that it does regarding source code files?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gb043o/kotlin_the_first_source_code_file_that_is_read/)

## [10][What exactly is "R" in the code written below?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gb40jj/what_exactly_is_r_in_the_code_written_below/)

view.findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.*button\_first*).setOnClickListener **{**  
 *findNavController*().navigate(R.id.*action\_FirstFragment\_to\_SecondFragment*)  
**}**

&amp;#x200B;

**So I looked everywhere on my Android Studio and searched for any other case where R shows up in the entire project and it didn't return any result. What is an "R" in the context of R.id.button\_first ? it obviously seems like it's a variable but I never set any variable named "R" nor did any of the default source code that came with it. Please help.**
