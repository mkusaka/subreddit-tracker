Minus ALL of the XML files that define the UIs. 

This seems to be going the route of GWT, Flutter, and React Native where the UI is defined within code. This is an excellent start to simplifying the UI development experience.

Hi, I'm new to Android Dev and understand that Kotlin is Google's primary language of choice.  But, does the IDE depend on Java 8 and updates in any way?

Hey,

So at work we have a modular app, divided in several modules

Our team has access to one of the modules and the main app

I wanted to know if there's a possibility to run the main app, link it somehow to our module locally, and when debugging the main app, actually call our running module and debug it aswell

So basically debugging the main app and our module at the same time
## [10][Livedata asynchronous](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/es9m9s/livedata_asynchronous/)

Is livedata asynchronous? Because its the same as rxjs and rxjava.. And since it is called when data is changed then I think it is asynchronous. So my question is if it is asynchronous then we don't need courtines or executor to create another thread, we can just use livedata for that or am I thinking about it in a wrong way?

Because in javascript it is single threaded and we can use rxjs for any I/O operation. So was wondering if livedata is the same or not

Hello Guys,

im Studying CS and ive got an assigment where i have to create an Android App.

Im searching for some sort of Components, so that i dont have to copy paste all my UI "code".

For Example: if i want to create a Table in HTML i would do something like this

i nest all my cells in a row, and all my rows inside a table

    &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;row&gt;&lt;cell/&gt;&lt;cell/&gt;&lt;cell/&gt;&lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;row&gt;..&lt;/row&gt;
    ...
    &lt;table&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

There fore i just have to write the code for my cell one time, the code for my row one time etc 

and reuse it without copy pasting all the code

If i google Android components i dont find something like that. What are this Components called in Android? Are this Fragements?

&amp;#x200B;

Ty in advance
## [12][Should I just use the templates given by Android Studio and just 'extrapolate' from there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/es918b/should_i_just_use_the_templates_given_by_android/)

I created a project on Android Studio and picked Navigation Drawer Activity as the project template. This is entirely different from what I usually do, which is to start with just an Empty Activity. 

When I read at the code generated by Android Studio after it loads, wow....three days and I still am not done digesting and absorbing everything into my brain. 

I have this habit of wanting to 100 percent fully understand and internalize code before I use it. It worked for me in my beginner phase when I wrote apps mainly using TextView, ImageView, EditText, Buttons, RadioButtons, etc. 

Things got a little trickier when it came to using RecyclerViews. I took some time trying to understand the code, but I managed. 

But a Navigation Drawer........wow. It's seriously dragging on my time, I doubt that I will be able to fully digest this by the end of today. 

Should I just...try not to 100% percent understand the code and just follow the code's template to save time? I wonder if this is what devs normally do in the workplace setting. 

I don't want to be labelled to be that one guy who relies on templates and doesn't understand shit.
