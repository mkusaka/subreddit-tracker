I'm a front end dev w/ mostly Vue experience and is looking to build my first mobile side project. I want to build something ASAP, and it seems that the easiest options were vue-native(which just compiles into RN) and *NativeScript*.

From my limited research it seemed that from a tech stack perspective NativeScript seemed better than React Native since it can access native apis. And the main downside is the lack of big community like the one RN has. However, it seems that there's literally NOBODY using NativeScript.

Most conversations on Reddit about NativeScript are at least 1 year old. And the NativeScript npm package install timeline also looks dead post mid 2019.

**Why?** Vue's getting more popular, people are getting pissed at React Native, shouldn't NativeScript also grow with it?
