In this episode, Nate and Andrew talk with guest, Chris Oliver, creator of GoRails and HatchBox. He worked with an astrophysicist using Rails to sync data between various applications and CMS systems. The guys go in-depth about GoRails, HatchBox, videos Chris has made (and there are  
MANY), IRC Bots, and many other interesting things. There may even be a  
funny story or two from the guys.

If I have an array like \[1, 3\]  I wish to build a string as 

    "id: 1 OR id: 3"

Could you tell me what the cleanest way to do it is in ruby? 

I was thinking of MAP and JOIN but it wasn't looking clean when i had to avoid the last OR

I'm new to Webpack (and Rails) so everything is kinda confusing to me.

From what I know from reading up on it is that Sprockets is a simple file concatenator, but Webpack is an actual dependency manager.

The code I'm working with has files that assumes certain variables will be available after the concatenation. However, in webpack you would have to explicitly import those variables since the scope of a module is its dependencies.

I came across this article on global variables with Webpack which is really helpful:

Hi, i tried using RVM to install ruby, then it heated up my computer, and I don't actually need to install Ruby again, so I stopped the installation while it's at the compilation step. How do I clean up in order to now waste any space for the partial installation?

I don't really mind installing the dependencies, since they're small and I might end up needing them anyway. But I want to remove the downloaded files specifically for the particular ruby version. I already removed everything inside */.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.7.0, are there anything else?*

Here's the output from the installation:

I haven’t programmed in a while because of my new job, and I’m very VERY rusty now, but from what I hear, a new Ruby version is out and I can’t wait to get back into it. Anything I need to get back in? I might start doing the back end with ruby for my portfolio.
