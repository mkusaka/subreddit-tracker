Hey guys,
I am a python developer and sometime ago one my senior developers suggested the book Fluent Python to me. It was a revelation. It basically allowed me to level up and have better understanding of what was possible. 

Is there a book that's like that for Go?

Hi all,

Hopefully, this might help some people. I'm doing consulting in a 25 years old credit bureau were faxes and printed document were the standard and unchangeable processes.

Circumstances forced for some adaptation. To ensure employees continue to work from home, I've built a remote-friendly replacement for all the fax machines and printed document processes.

We are using QR-Code detection via a Google Cloud Run container to dispatch incoming faxes to the right employee.

I've shared as much code as I could. If you need to replace a physical fax machine and prevent manual processing of printed documents, this will certainly help you get started.

Here's the link to the article: https://dominicstpierre.com/paperless-go-twilio-fax-email

Thanks
