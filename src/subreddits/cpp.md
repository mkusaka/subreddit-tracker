**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

At CppCon 2017, Bjarne's keynote address was in part on the need for C++ to have better support for new programmers, using the metaphor of difficulty settings on a camera, where you can set it to "Auto" (ironic) to get pretty good performance for most people, with an easy curve, and then more advanced settings for people who know what they're doing.

My personal interest in C++ is making it easier for new programmers (the myth that C++ is hard for newbies is a pet peeve of mine, but it also has some truth). Sort of like the Lorax, who speaks for the trees, I look at C++ from the perspective of someone who is coding in C++ for the first time.

One of the earliest topics covered in C++ is also one of the hardest to do right for new programmers: cin. Few new programmers are capable of inputting even a single integer using cin properly. By this I mean that they handle errors correctly (What if the user types "squirrel" instead of an integer? What if an EOF is received on the keyboard?), know how to clear the error flags and reprompt in a loop. Especially without just copy/pasting boilerplate code that they don't really understand.

For example, this is a typical way you'll see someone get three integers from the standard input:  

    int x,y,z;
    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;    

Why is this bad? An error could take place in any of the three inputs, causing a cascading failure (I'll talk about errors further below), and the seemingly innocuous fact that x, y and z are uninitialized, which *shouldn't* present a problem, *except when it does*. But people write code this way since the way cin works won't allow declaring a variable and initializing it from the keyboard on the same line. So a lot of paranoid/experienced programmers do this instead:

    int x = 0, y = 0, z = 0;
    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;

But this isn't great either, because we're setting a value on a variable that literally will never use that value. Ideally it will be discarded by the optimizer, but you're still typing code that should be discarded, which is cognitively nonsensical to new programmers.

From my personal experience, a lot of new programmers want to (and often try to) write code something like this:

    int x = cin, y = cin, z = cin;

Because then you can declare a value and initialize it from the keyboard at the same time. We can also do this with const variables, which is nice. Const, after all, doesn't mean compile time determinable, but rather immutable once set. But it is impossible to have cin &gt;&gt; work with const at all, since it can't be combined with a variable declaration.

Since C++11, const has become more and more important to us, and the inability to set a const variable using cin is, to me, enough impetus in and of itself to suggest we should have something in the standard library that would play nicely with the const-everything movement. For example, something like this from a small header library I wrote [here](https://github.com/ShakaUVM/read):

    const int ROWS = read&lt;int&gt;();

And since we're talking about modern C++ trends, there's also auto. I'm not a huge fan of the Auto Almost Anywhere movement, but the auto keyword has certainly been popping up a lot in modern codebases. And auto doesn't work with "cin &gt;&gt;" at all:

    auto x;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
(This will not compile since auto x cannot deduce its type, and it can't even be made to work because cin can't appear on the right hand side of an assignment operation the way we need it to.) So we could do something like this and make the Auto Gang happy:

    const auto NAME = read&lt;string&gt;();

This way you don't need to specify the type twice, which is nice from a Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) standpoint.

The next major problem with "cin &gt;&gt;" is how it works, or doesn't work, when you mix cin &gt;&gt; with getline. (For those of you who don't know, cin &gt;&gt; will leave a trailing newline in the input buffer, causing the getline to return an empty string... but only the first getline.) I have seen this trip up... well, basically everyone at one point or another, but new programmers especially are baffled when their code seems to just non-deterministically not work.

The biggest problem with cin, however, is error checking. The main strength of cin, its design *raison d'etre*, is that it can chain together multiple input statements at once and then (hopefully the user will remember to) check for errors after:

    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;
    if (!cin) { ... }
The trouble is that this is very nearly always bad code. Except in the most trivial of programs, where you exit() if anything at all out of place happens, it is a very serious problem to not be able to tell which variable the input failed on. Does x have a valid value? y? Well, we know z doesn't. Since we don't know how many valid values have been successfully consumed from the input stream, we can't recover from it without the user's help.

Also because of the fact that once one input fails, all subsequent calls fail, without the programmer being very careful to vet their input (which most new programmers aren't) their code will typically explode and fall into an infinite loop the second the user enters anything that doesn't exactly match what their code is expecting. Cin results in fragile code.

So to combat these problems, new programmers typically hit up Stack Overflow and get pointed to boilerplate code [like this example from the FAQ](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/input-output#istream-and-ignore) that will let them recover from an erroneous input and reprompt:

        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
        #include &lt;limits&gt;
        int main()
        {
          int age = 0;
          while ((std::cout &lt;&lt; "How old are you? ")
                 &amp;&amp; !(std::cin &gt;&gt; age)) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "That's not a number; ";
            std::cin.clear();
            std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), '\n');
          }
          std::cout &lt;&lt; "You are " &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old\n";
          // ...
        }

And they need to do this with every. single. integer. ever. read. from. cin. How many new programmers do you think can code that from memory? How many do you think will be diligent enough to copy/paste the code so that they can recover from an error on every input? And if they did, how horrible is their code going to look?

If you are ready to respond, "Well, that should be wrapped up in a function" then, well, I'm in agreement with you. My take on it [is here](https://github.com/ShakaUVM/read) on GitHub. I think we need something along these lines in std. 

**Standard libraries exist to make complex tasks simple, and common tasks easy.** Especially (again, from my perspective as the Lorax) for new programmers. What we have right now, and have dealt with since the 90s, is generations of new programmers not properly vetting their inputs, and *learning* to not vet their inputs since it's too complicated to memorize and too verbose for their code to look any good, which leads to "teh hax" down the line as they write code in production the same way they learned in school. 

I don't think we should remove cin or getline or any of the existing tools, but I do think we need an "auto setting" for new programmers for input.

[My header-only library](https://github.com/ShakaUVM/read) does the following things:

1. Handles prompting the user alongside the input, like how Python does it.
2. If you ask it for an int, by golly, *it will give you an int*. It will throw away input the user types in, clearing any errors, reprompting the user each time, until a valid int is read.
3. It allows freely mixing the "cin &gt;&gt;" and getline() analogues without bugs.
4. It allows you to declare a variable and initialize it from an input stream on one line, allowing more compact, sensible, readable, and safer code.
5. It allows you to use const with input
6. It allows you to use auto with input
7. It works with any type that has an operator&gt;&gt; and default constructor defined for it.
8. It's far less verbose than similar code in Java (java.util.scanner) and is type safe, unlike the equivalent code in Python.
9. Returns an default object if it hits an EOF, otherwise it is impossible for it to leave the input stream in an error state, preventing cascading errors from multiple cins chained together.
10. It probably makes the functional people happy to have input treated as a normal function.

Compared to that giant block of code from the FAQ above, this is all a new programmer would have to write:

    int age = read&lt;int&gt;("Please enter your age: ");
    cout &lt;&lt; "You are " &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old.\n";

I've tried this out with new programmers, and unsurprisingly they like the more compact option.

Downsides? You lose the ability to manually handle error checking and recovery (it's an "auto setting", remember?), and you could also probably write a more performant version. But benchmarking it on a million ints, it has the same speed as the old way of reading data as long as the optimizer is on and ASAN is off. It will introduce angle bracket notation earlier than they'd probably normally encounter them, but new programmers seem to take it in stride.

I remember reading some (new?) syntax to ease cases like:

    int flag = 1;
    int result = setsockopt(sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, (char *) &amp;flag, sizeof(int));

by passing `flag` straight into the function. Something like `&amp;[1]`, but I cannot recall the syntax, or the name of the technique. Is there such thing in newer C++ versions?
