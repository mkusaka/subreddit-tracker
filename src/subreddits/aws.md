[AWS Video Catalog](https://awsvideocatalog.com/) is a website that collects all the official Amazon videos related to each individual AWS Service and categorizes them in a way that makes it easy to find what you are looking for. No more fighting YouTube search or relying on an algorithm to find what you are looking for. Everything is in one place. â€“ This means that AWS Video Catalog will allow you to discover older videos that are still invaluable.

On the docs it says AWS provides secure and private connectivity between EC2 instnsces of al types. What exactly do they mean here though? Got a client with a requirement that all traffic internally and externally is TLS encrypted. So my question ishow do instances within a VPC communicate. do we need to set up TLS ourselves or is aws handling this already?

I have a c++ program that i'd like to run across many different workers / threads. None of the workers need to interact with eachother, but they should all be able to signal success / keep their own logs of their best results. This is a one off simulation i'd like to run, and there seem to be quite a few options for how to achieve this in aws.

One option is to spin up an EC2, but this seems wasteful and would have many extra steps. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-node-parallel-jobs.html seems closer to what i'm looking for, but then there's also https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/.

 Hi, does anyone have Teams optimizations for Amazon Workspaces? I haven't seen much out there so i figured i'd ask. Workspaces is not even listed as being supported on Microsoft teams website....

The following 4 regions are disabled by default:

* Africa (Cape Town)
* Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
* Europe (Milan)
* Middle East (Bahrain)

What is the reason for not having enabled by default why the rest of the zones? Is it due to higher costs or different legislation in these countries?

Hi all,
I'm evaluating if AWS FSx is an option for my company, but still would like to offer the full power of the LAN connection with an on-prem. fileserver for the office users.

So I was thinking DFS with on target on-prem. and one in AWS. But I don't find anyone on the internet who has done this setup. Probably because DFS-r is not supported.

My questions: 
- Can I replace DFS-r with AWS Data sync?
  - two sync jobs(back and forth)?
- Did anyone try this out? Does it work as expected (fast everywhere and admins happy)?
## [8][Considering AWS - How will AWS help us transition / train staff](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/ivj53c/considering_aws_how_will_aws_help_us_transition/)

We have a company of 250 people, and we are growing quite quickly. We are considering AWS because we worry about security and scaling issues. My partner is worried about the transition as our engineers don't have much / any experience with AWS and it is important that we don't have down time due to our lack of knowledge. I looked at their site, but I'm not sure how they will help us train staff / assist us in migrating, and what that will cost us. I have seen solutions architects mentioned before, but do they charge for access to them, or is that part of the support plan?

Hi..  I'm still new to wordpress and aws so forgive me if the question is dumb. I successfully configured wp-&gt;cloudfront-&gt;s3 via offload media. I upload the files ftp to wp but that's not actually upload to cdn. How do i upload the files via ftp like the usual wp UI upload which are directly available on media library and cdn links attached on it? I tried manual upload to S3 but then i'm not sure how to embed the videos. 

Really hit a major stone here guys.. please help, thanks!
