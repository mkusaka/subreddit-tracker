We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

I'm loading up some data from an API and if I request 10 items, while the data is still coming in, I'm loading 10 skeleton components in place of the real components.

Each of these skeletons is identical, so I'd like to cache them and then just copy them into the place of each item while it's rendering.

For the life of me though, I can't get `memo` or `useMemo` to let me do this.  When I put a console.log in the `SkeletonEntry` component, it logs for each element in the list.

Given this sample code
    
    const SkeletonEntry = () =&gt; {
       console.log('loadingSkeleton')
       return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;
    }

    const MyListInLoadingState = () =&gt; {
      const Body = Array.from(new Array(10)).map((val, index) =&gt; (
        &lt;SkeletonEntry
          key={index}
        /&gt;
      ))

    return (
        &lt;Fragment&gt;
          {Body}
        &lt;/Fragment&gt;
      )
 }

What do I need to do to only make `SkeletonEntry` `console.log` 1 time?
## [8][How to handle components who need internal state inside a redux environment](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f97hzf/how_to_handle_components_who_need_internal_state/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f97hzf/how_to_handle_components_who_need_internal_state/

I've been working with react and redux for about 3-4 years now and it's not often that I come to a point where I'm not shure how to handle something.

We have a functional app that uses a lot of tables, tabs and stuff. Mostly data visualisation in tables and editing this data. Everything is handles in redux and react basically just shows data and triggers actions (as it should be).

We're in early alpha and our client absolutely insists on using devexpress (devextreme) now for all our componentes. Since he made his point clear and pays for it we are definetely switching our entire components.

Devexpress was never inteded to be used with react but it offers some components which are basically wrappers for their code. Now most of the components cant handle rerenders very well and the should absolutely be used with their provided data store which is a class that handles all the logic inside the table and also comunicates with the api...

What do you guys think? How should this be handled? I have to use this library which is unusable if not used as intended but I also want to keep as much information as possible in the redux store. I'm thinking about letting the devexpress stuff handle all data loading and manipulation. Then store everything view related (like selected tab, ...) in the redux store.

I'm totaly afraid we will run into serious issues with this and I hate these kind of mixed approaches.

Should I just dump redux and go back to internal state handling... even if this is a business desktop scale software?

Dumping the new component set (devexpress) is not an option.

I have a form that captures input state and spits out a string on submit.

What I want to do is download the rendered state as an HTML file on submit instead.

I've created a post on Stack Overflow where someone recommended I use ReactDomServer but I'm unfamiliar with the concept (fairly new). Is there an elegant way to achieve this?

Here is said post which shows example code: https://stackoverflow.com/q/60370940/3357677

Thanks in advance for any help.
