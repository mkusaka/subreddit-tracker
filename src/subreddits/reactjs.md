We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys, I'd like to share a project I just finished called Flicka. It's a simple web app for finding similar movies to groups of movies. For example, you can add a romance movie and a comedy movie, and it'll show a bunch of rom coms. I learned React for the first time while working on it, and I think it's really awesome! I really like how modular it is and it makes everything so much easier. It's a lot different from what I'm used to but I think I'm going to use it for a long time. For the backend, I used Flask and Python because my app does a lot of data manipulation and needs Pandas. I ended up hosting it on Heroku, having the flask server serve the static frontend build in addition to the api endpoints.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be awesome if you guys could check out my app and tell me what you think. It's just a small project for me to get back into web dev and I'd like to know if I'm on the right track and how I can improve.

How can I export a javascript knockout component and use it in ReactJS?

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to search on internet, but couldn't find anything that is relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to use it as custom element?
## [10][I18n with arrays (React-Intl)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g4sait/i18n_with_arrays_reactintl/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g4sait/i18n_with_arrays_reactintl/

Using React-Intl:

  
I am currently working on a website which reads its data out of two json files (de.json and en.json).  
Now there is also a page where I need to read data either out of an english array or a german array depending on what language is selected (Each array is currently a simple js file with just the array inside of it and it just gets imported into the file where I need to read its data). The way it is working right now is by me checking if the locale is english and then using that array, however that solution is not clean.

const mediaArray =Â localeÂ === "en" ?Â ResourcesMediaEnÂ :Â ResourcesMedia

 Is there a way to just store both arrays in either the en.json or de.json file and read out the data depending which language is selected. If not could you approach that in any other way?
