## [3][Deploying rails app using Nginx](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/exnchp/deploying_rails_app_using_nginx/)

I just put my project on a server, then I ran its production env.

Now, I configured nginx like this : 

           root /home/prp-e/dakhlokharj/public;
    
            # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
            index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    
            server_name _;
    
            location / {
                    # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                    # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                    #try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                    proxy_pass       https://localhost:3000;
                    proxy_set_header Host      $host;
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            }

But when I go to the domain, it still shows me the old static index.

P.S : Ruby installed using RVM.

I have a scope which is defined as below in the associations file of the Account model

     has_many :users, -&gt; { where(type: "Requester").order(:id) },
     class_name: 'Requester', dependent: :delete_all  

But when I see the query generated by this from the console I see many similar conditions being duplicated

    SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE 
    `users`.`type` IN ('Requester') AND 
    `users`.`account_id` = 1 AND 
    `users`.`type` IN ('Requester') AND 
    `users`.`type` = 'Requester'  
    ORDER BY `users`.`type` ASC

I'm not sure why there is multiple conditions being generated which might have an impact on the query performance.

I'm using rails 4.2.1

Could you please tell me how I can debug this or find out how this query generation works?

I'm trying to use the rubocop Code extension to format code on saving but I get the famous "An error occured during autocorrection"

This is the settings.json file related to what I have. Yet I keep getting this error. I'm using Macbook Pro if that is required.

    "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true, 
    "editor.formatOnSaveTimeout": 0, 
    "diffEditor.renderSideBySide": true,
    "ruby.format": "rubocop", 
    "ruby.rubocop.executePath": "pathto//bin/rubocop/", 
    "[ruby]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "misogi.ruby-rubocop" }

This is the error message I get.

The path to rubocop is correct in the actual settings.json file.

I followed every instruction from [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48030698/vscode-vscode-ruby-rubocop-how-to-auto-correct-on-save](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48030698/vscode-vscode-ruby-rubocop-how-to-auto-correct-on-save)

When I try to run it fro command line the rubocop comand works just fine. This looks like more of a VS Code error.

Could you please help me resolve this?

If your frontend dev gave you a [custom.scss](https://gist.github.com/oystersauce8/b84abe760127474d5adaefd56e6a015d),
where do you place it in a rails 6 / bootstrap 4
application?

sidenote: I used [this gist](https://gist.github.com/bazzel/2c64e2e5804077f9a61938a93ed54823) when setting up the bootstrap on rails.

We were hoping to jump to the latest version of rails to rectify a bunch of identified vulnerabilities.  This Rails code is heavily hand edited, so if necessary, switching from tiny_tds would not be unthinkable, but the data we are fetching is, and will always be in an MS SQL database.  Must we use rails 5.x?

I have a react app with rails backend which needs to support the following:

1. all the devise stuff like sign up, sign in, sign out, confirmation via email, forget password
2. Need a way to authenticate\_user! based on JWT Tokens
3. Support for refresh\_token so that we can keep the user logged in
4. External authentication systems like Login via Google and Facebook

As I understand these 4 requirements are pretty standard for a modern web app. I was surprised to see the lack of a single out of the box solution for it. Here's what I know.

* Devise is necessary. We need something that extends it to do the rest.
* Omniauth plugin for devise covers 4
* devise-jwt covers 2 but not 3
* doorkeeper covers 2 and 3, but struggles with 4 and steps on devise's shoes in places.

Does anyone have any suggestions to consider?

A long time ago, I made a font-api, and I wanted to use that in my current rails project. So, I tested two scenarios and non of them worked. 

1. Font API :   
my API works like this, you add this to your html file and then call fonts in CSS stylings.   
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="[http://api.azadqalam.ir/fonts?font=FONTNAME](http://api.azadqalam.ir/fonts?font=FONTNAME) /&gt; 
2. This : [https://gist.github.com/anotheruiguy/7379570](https://gist.github.com/anotheruiguy/7379570)   


I did both of them and I performed : 

    rake assets:precompile
    

But I still see system's default font in the project!
## [12][ActionCable (Redis) -&gt; reconnect on redis connection error](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ewn1e4/actioncable_redis_reconnect_on_redis_connection/)

Hello! 

I work on an application which has ActionCable implemented with Redis.

I would like to know whether it is possible to reset the entire ActionCable setup in case the Redis throws Connection error.

I would like to connect to a different Redis url when the connection error occurs. The infrastructure of this Redis service is that there are two Redis databases mirrored, and there are frequent planned maintanance on the service which can cause the shut down of one of the databases. Unfortunately the switch is not solved by the service itself, however it provides us 2 connection urls. These are the ones I would like to switch between automatically.

Is it possible to do with ActionCable.

I know it is possible with ActiveRecord database connection
