I am in dire need of help, as I am about to pull out what is left of my hair. I am trying to get my new server up and running, and I realize this may not be the right place for this post, but I am hopefully at least someone can point me in the right direction.

I have transferred my app to my server, still working on getting my deployment working properly, but that is an issue for another day. Currently, when I attempt to `curl` `127.0.1.1` I get the following:

`403 Forbidden`

`Forbidden`

`You don't have permission to access this resource.`

`Apache/2.4.38 (Debian) Server at` `127.0.1.1` `Port 80`

&amp;#x200B;

I am at my wits end with this server! My apache2/sites-available/app.conf

`&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;`

    `DocumentRoot /var/www/app/releases/current/`

&amp;#x200B;

    `&lt;Location /&gt;`

`Require all granted`

    `&lt;/Location&gt;`	

`&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;`

I am currently only trying to access the site via it's IP address as it will be taking over for an older server. I'll happily add anything that might be needed. Please reddit, you are my only hope!

## [7][Discovered SimpleCov, what can I do with it ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hwf6um/discovered_simplecov_what_can_i_do_with_it/)

Hi, I just discovered [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) and looove the html output and the conclusions we can draw with it.

However, I can't really find a way to use it effectively. Thus I wonder, how do you use it (if you do of course) and what for ? 

&amp;#x200B;

I learnt about SimpleCov looking around Skunk that uses it at some point; this is IMO a great usage of SimpleCov.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love a regular check of it on one of our projects that needs to be really well covered, maybe looking around Github action ? Anyway, just wanted to know if anyone uses it and what for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks !

Anyone have resources for nice/good-looking action mailer email templates? Thinking one that incorporates a logo, has social links at the bottom, centered text etc. Any/all resources are appreciated.

I have a view where customers can change the delivery date of their shipments by selecting a date in [Flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/). The flatpickr instance is connected to a remote `form_with`input field which submits the form on change via stimulus. 

This is all working manually in the browser but I obviously also want to test it automatically via system tests (I'm using Rails' system tests with rspec, selenium and capybara). However, it looks like Capybara doesn't wait long enough for the remote form to submit. I currently have the following test:

&gt; delivery_date = find("span", text: "27")

&gt; expect {

&gt; &gt;delivery_date.click

&gt; }.to change { shipment.reload.delivery_date }

which fails. However, if I change it to sleep for a second it works:

&gt; delivery_date = find("span", text: "27")

&gt; expect {

&gt; &gt; delivery_date.click

&gt; &gt; sleep 1

&gt; }.to change { shipment.reload.delivery_date }

Is there something that I'm doing wrong here like some syntax that I'm not following? The only thing that I manually added to rspec regarding system tests is the following in my `rails_helper.rb`:

&gt;  config.before(:each, type: :system) do

&gt;    driven_by :rack_test

&gt;  end

&gt;  config.before(:each, type: :system, js: true) do

&gt;    driven_by :selenium_chrome_headless

&gt;  end

which just changes the driver based on whether or not the test needs js (which I have enabled for the above test). I also tried changing the `Capybara.default_max_wait_time` to 10 in a before action without luck.

Hey All, I'm trying to implement fuzzy search with Elasticsearch. I'm able to return results when I type in the query correctly, but now I am having trouble with fuzziness. I'm not having any luck with any of the online guides, does anyone have suggestions for a rails article with elasticsearch and a simple fuzzy search set up?  


`def search`  
 `@elasticsearchresults = Car.__elasticsearch__.search(`  
`{`  
 `query: {`  
 `match: {`  
 `message: {`  
 `query: params[:q],`  
 `fuzziness: 1`  
`}`  
`}`  
`}`  
`}).records`  
`end`

Hello. So I am developing an app with an application system. The user applies to my platform and then an admin or somebody with high enough permissions decides whether to accept the application or deny it. 

Let's say he accepts it. When he accepts it, the user is automatically created. I am wondering if it is safe to generate a temporary password with something like [Passgen gem](https://github.com/cryptice/Passgen) and then store it as the user's password until he changes it.

I would also need to send a confirmation email to his email address with a success message and a temporary password. Is it safe to send a password like that?

I am also wondering. If I hash that random password, how do I send it in plain text for a user to understand in the email?

Or is there any other, better way to handle this situation. Thanks!

No problem embedding images, but haven't had luck leveraging FA-icons for this.
