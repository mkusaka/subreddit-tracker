I just discovered [framer-motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) and it's actually ridiculous how easy it is to create complex animations and what it does to improve the look and feel of a website.

Anything else life-changing out there? Can be funny, can be useful, can be just plain genius! Would love to hear about your discoveries. No links to generic lists please, tell me about your own personal experience and why you like it.

 Hey folks,

So, I've had an issue with a React-Firebase project I'm working on. I'm based in New Zealand, so I set the cloud firestore location to as close to me as possible, which is australia-southeast1.

When I was making post requests to my firestore, I kept getting the error "FirebaseÂ IDÂ tokenÂ hasÂ expired.Â GetÂ aÂ freshÂ IDÂ tokenÂ fromÂ yourÂ clientÂ appÂ andÂ tryÂ again".

I noticed that when I set my laptop to eastern Australian time, it fixed the problem - I could make post requests with any faults. Firebase tokens expire after an hour, so I can only assume that because of the two hour time difference, firebase thought I was sending it expired tokens. Obviously I want to create a website that people in all time zones use, so how do I fix this?

I feel like this is a stupid question that reflects my lack of understanding of how servers work, but hey, I'm a newbie. Anyway, code as follows:

Me and the team have to build webapp with React, and the same mobile app built with React Native. We need to add a video call integration, it needs to be one-to-one AND multiple. Noone of us have experience on that. The difficult part is finding one library which helps us on both platforms, web and mobile. One plus would be, on mobile, that it works with Expo; it would be better so we can count on its features without ejecting.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any suggestion? Thanks a lot!

Is it because of the pool of developers? Or actual engineering reasons? Or a legacy adoption of react when vue wasnt that popular?
