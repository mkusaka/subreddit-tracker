We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi guys,

I finally built my portfolio. I‚Äôve done it with Nextjs, and Styled Components.

Nextjs is very easy to take up compared to Gatsby. The routing is very basic so it never gets in the way.

One thing that is sometimes a pain to deal with is the SSR by default.

So I'm part of a militant newspaper from Argentina called "La Izquierda Diario" ("Left's Newspaper" would be the closest translation in English) that is the most well known newspaper from the region amongst not hegemonical media.

Two months ago we decided to go bold and add a Multimedia twist to the brand, to allow not only for written stories but also YouTube programs and podcasts. Today we count with more than 20 YouTube shows and three podcasts, we produce an enormous quantity of audiovisual material every day and I was responsible for the design and programming of the new Multimedia section of the newspaper. Not only we made it to production with a very successful launch mas Tuesday but I'm also very proud of the frontend I designed and coded, using entirely Create-react-app and some very useful npm packages.

You can visit the site and tell me what you think about it here [La Izquierda Diario Multimedia](http://multimedia.laizquierdadiario.com), although it's Worth mentioning it's not perfect yet, we are still polishing some stuff.

I‚Äôm doing my first ‚Äúserious‚Äù project right now and have about 15-20 variables to store (yeah, I know that it‚Äôs not much, but for me it‚Äôs pretty a lot). Should I store them like an object in 2-3 main hooks states or split them up and store independently?

I‚Äôm not sure because all tutorials and docs show programs with at max 2-3 variables, which they store in separate hooks states, but I‚Äôm not sure if its a right thing to do with bigger projects.

Also, yeah, I was thinking about Redux as well, but everyone says that you should use redux mostly in big projects (and I don‚Äôt think my project is big enough), so I‚Äôm not sure.

Thanks in advance!
## [8][Need help integrating cashfree on frontend only reactjs + firebase](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gtdpou/need_help_integrating_cashfree_on_frontend_only/)

Hey good people of r/reactjs,

I'm building an e-commerce site for a client that's adamant on not paying for a backend right now.

They've already paid for a payment gateway subscription from [cashfree](https://www.cashfree.com/). I've informed them of the risks of exposing their credentials on a front-end only app and they are apparently fine with it.

My current stack is react (default create-react-app config) + redux
And am using firebase firestore for data storage.

The cashfree api requires 
1. a returnUrl where it will send the response for the payment.
2. A suggests to have a notifyUrl where it'll communicate the response of a transaction for sync. Just in case there is a network outage between making payment and returning to the returnUrl.

Can anyone help/advice me on how to implement these hopefully in just client-side react or maybe with firebase functions.
## [9][I want to combine an async function inside of a custom hook utilizing redux's useSelector. How can I do that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gt88fv/i_want_to_combine_an_async_function_inside_of_a/)

I'm having a hard time conceptualizing what I need to do. 

Basically, I have a store that contains a large list of objects (1028 to be exact). However, the elements in that list do not have all the information I need, so when I grab one I need to make an API call to get more information for that object and then sticks it back into the store.

The part where I grab the extra information with an API call works, that isn't a problem. The problem I'm having is how to build a function that can use information gathered from useSelector **but also** wait for the information to be populated **and** be called multiple times in a single render with different parameters. 

My first idea was to use a useCallback that waited until the object was hydrated by just recursively called it using a timeout. Obviously this didn't work because the version of the dependency that it was recursively calling itself with never updates with the new data.

I have tried to throw around some other ideas, but I honestly never came up with anything better. 

The function might get called several times during a single render, each time bringing back a different result because it's grabbing something out of that larger list. So using something like a state doesn't really work.
