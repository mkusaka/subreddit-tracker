This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I created a gist with some notes about topics that might come up during an Android Interview. I hope this is useful to someone.

Hi there, i have an app on PlayStore  called [Dokkan Cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcv.spdesigns.dokkancards) which is a database of cards from a game called "Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle" on Google Play. 

After trying to submit a small  update that fixed some major crash issues, i was notified by Google Play that due to a Policy Violation my update had been rejected. This is the first time something like this has happened to me and i was so astonished by the lack of any information whatsoever on what i had done wrong. There was simply no info on what i did wrong in order to fix it. Long story short, after a couple of emails and a few days later they replied to me and informed me that my app implies an affiliation with the Dragon Ball franchise in its store listing.

 That sounds like a logical issue since i did have the words "Dragon Ball" in my app's description (but no affiliation or anything of that sorts) and maybe the images were not suitable either(maybe because they were displaying images from the game within my app). Having removed those images and text and describing shortly in the app's description that i am in no way affiliated with third parties and any copyrighted content belongs to them as described in my app's copyright disclaimer, I submitted another update with those changes. 

 No matter what changes i make, the store listing updates keep getting rejected. Does anybody have any idea what the issue could be? Could it be the name ? However, the word "Dokkan" is also used by many other applications and i don't think it's trademarked. I'd really appreciate some perspective on my app's store listing. Am i somehow implying an affiliation with anyone?

I'm planning to release another app, but as someone who is starting out, one thing I've definitely noticed is how 'insufficient' I am to release a good quality app.

I've just studied most about coding, but when it comes to an app, there's so much involved like design and marketing. When I released my first app, it was a bit of a struggle even trying to draw out my own app icon. It feels like I need to know and be good at everything if I want to release an app by myself.

So how do other indie developers deal with this?

I know for design I could learn a bit from material design. But one big missing piece is me learning photo editing software and other things like inkscape.

Currently, I want to make an app to help you tie knots (for those going out there in the wilderness with possibly no internet connection) but it's so hard to find good royalty free instruction images that I should probably try to create some myself.
