This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Any other developers that would love to work with the new Android 11 Device Controls?

But are hampered by the fact that they don't work on emulators??

Hello developers. I have a question for those using the MVVM architecture. When you read a file from storage and grab its uri, do you read the inputstream to get the file contents within the fragment or activity itself or you pass the uri to the viewmodel and do your other stuff from their?  Just curious.

Good morning r/Android! I’ve been recently working on an app called Sooner Home. It is essentially a launcher that replicates the Google Sooner experience to every Android device out there (proof of concept: https://ibb.co/jWNzBVt - Sooner Home running on a Galaxy A320FL). What is Google Sooner? Well, it’s the first prototype hardware that Android was developed upon, back in 2006. Although it is very difficult to get hold of such a prototype, with my app, Sooner Home, you can get your own phone have a similar Home Screen layout. What are your thoughts on my project? Would you like to see it someday on PlayStore? If yes, would you install it? Let’s discuss in the comments. (reposted from r/Android)
