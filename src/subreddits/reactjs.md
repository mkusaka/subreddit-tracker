We alternate between **Who's Hiring** (on the 1st of the month, [most recent one here][hiring:most recent]) and **Who's Available** (on the 15th, [most recent one here][available:most recent])

_I am sorry for the missing "Who's Available [Dec 2019]" üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_

Welcome to **the biggest React job board in the world!** This is like Hacker News' **Who's Hiring** but just for React. Top Level comments must be **Job Opportunities.**

‚ö†Ô∏è NEW: WE ARE REQUESTING EVERYBODY FOLLOW [THE HN Who's Hiring FORMAT][format:hiring:hn]

**Company inc. | Job Title | City/State Location | Full-time/Part-Time | On-site/Remote | (Optional) Salary range | Website jobs page, other hard requirements etc.**

What are the most exhaustive and up-to-date video tutorials? A lot of tutorials aren't exhaustive and covers only a part of what you can do with React, or are not up-to-date.

## [10][Problem with managing states of multiple radio buttons which should change the context of a JSON](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/exnpsk/problem_with_managing_states_of_multiple_radio/)

Hi folks, 

first of all, here is the link to [Stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-dr5ouj?embed=1&amp;file=UpdateState.js) with my code atm. I'm super new to the frontend stuff. So I try my best to understand the React Hooks but I'm not there yet.

I do have a problem managing the state of radio buttons while changing my context accordingly. The context consists of a json (which will come from a backend). I'd like to ask some questions and obviously I want to have some answers. They should change the context (json-array). At the end I would like to send the context back to my backend. 

1. The state of my buttons is correct. But the updateState function seems to be triggered first, so it picks up always the **last value** instead of the current one. How do I handle this async problem? (I saw this by using the chrome addon "React Developer Tools"
2. At line 12, I do update my json context. How can I manage to update a specific property of a specific object in my json-array. Imagine I want to change a property of json object 50 within an array which consists out of 100 json objects. How can I access the index/key there?

Any hints and tips are appreciated. 

Kind regards from Berlin!

Hey, 

I made a website on top of `gatsbyjs`, and thought i'll share it with the open source community. 

Demo: 

https://react-landnig-page.netlify.com/

code: 

https://github.com/zilahir/react-landing-page

I had some rough design ideas, based on very different inspirations i came across in the last years. 

Happily welcoming PRs. :) 

Enjoy.
