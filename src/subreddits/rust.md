Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j9l01t/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

A few months ago, I was wondering why we hoard Makefiles and why it is so painful to use an external library in a C project.

So I had this idea : Creating a project manager &amp; build tool for the C programming language.

I started to write a piece of code in C and it was not functionning properly (Cause I'm one of the worst C developers in this world) but i continued 'till we cannot run that thing.

At the same time, I was learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) ; so, I decided to try to rewrite the whole project in that language.

After a few weeks of rewriting, I had a correct product. The 08/10/2020, Wanager 1.0 was released. It had only a few features : project creation and reinitializing, project build and run and header creation. 

At that point, someone called Lockeer told me that it will be cool if we can manage libraries. 

So I wrote a simple system to install libraries hosted on my vps, with a submission system based on mailing. It was working, but limited because of vps bandwidth and the complexity of submiting by email.

So SuperFola poped up :

At first time, I decided, as he advised me, to use the github api that produces a tar archive of the repo. 
I stucked on that for weeks because the command I was running was producing a corrupted file. 

After raging on that problem, I realised that I'll gain some portability and time with cloning directly with a git command. 

It worked good, so, everything is fine !

But Il_totore opened an issue :

So I made python support for build scripts with minimal version of 3.5.x and allowed path specification.

After that, on his advice, I made kind of Python API to have nice build scripts and it produced that :

```py
from wngbuild import * # Import all from wngbuild module

build = BuildProfile(files="src/*.c",output="build/custom/prog.exe" ) # setup a build profile that will compile all files in src/ and place the binary in build/custom/prog.exe
build.cc = "C:\\MinGW\\bin\\gcc.exe" # Setup the compiler (optional, by default "gcc")
build.flags = "-W -Wall -Werror -Wextra" # Setup the flags that the command will be run with (optional)

build.run() # Run the compilation command
build.runOutput() # Run the binary produced by the compilation command (Will raise an error if the compilation command fails)
```

https://github.com/Wmanage/wng

It is still WIP, there are loads of features that I can add to it but I will be more very happy to answer your questions or help you use it.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
