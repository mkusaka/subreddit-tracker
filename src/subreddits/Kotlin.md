## [3][GraphQL API integration tests in a Spring Boot 2.x Kotlin application](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gd7ff5/graphql_api_integration_tests_in_a_spring_boot_2x/)

In order to test end-to-end scenarios, the author wanted an easy way to…

* start the back-end exposing the GraphQL API endpoint
* define test GraphQL queries
* load the test GraphQL queries
* prepare &amp; send GraphQL HTTP queries

In this post, the author assumes that you’re already using graphql-java and exposing it using graphql-java-servlet or equivalent means: https://medium.com/dSebastien/graphql-api-integration-tests-in-a-spring-boot-2-x-kotlin-application-5840d3c5d66f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=9f22a7426e83f8ae02ace369174c2b62

Hi, there is a job opportunity programming Kotlin but I've never learned it. I program C, C++ and JavaScript. How long you think would take someone with that background to learn Kotlin.

I want to now if that job is a loose battle even before starting or I have a chance.

## [7][Which wrapper should I use for a Kotlin Discord Bot ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gcsq3u/which_wrapper_should_i_use_for_a_kotlin_discord/)

It's actually my first time creating a Discord Bot. I checked out the basics of how to make one with JS but...well...JS. So I searched for Java/Kotlin wrapper alternatives and actually found JDA, Diskord and Kord. The first one was developed for Java (but is obviously Kotlin compatible), and the others for Kotlin. JDA is already pretty API complete and has been used by many, but it unfortunately doesn't use all of Kotlin's power, as opposed to Diskord or Kord. Though, these two are still young. (I should mention that I do not plan to use Discord Voice (which those two can't do anyway))

It would be great if you guys could give me some advice on this ! Thank you in advance !
