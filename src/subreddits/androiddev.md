I  gathered quite a few utils functions in a library, using kotlin   extension functions to simplify common operations when Android framework   API was too cumbersome. Like in this very simple example:

    val View.contentWidth: Int get() = width - paddingLeft - paddingRight  

I would like to add unit  tests to this library but have no idea how  to test this. I'm new to  unit tests and already read a lot of  documentation on how to getting started but feel a bit lost about it at  the moment and trying to search directly for a solution yielded no result.

## [10][What kind of data type column you use in SQLite, to store LocalDate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jka2ek/what_kind_of_data_type_column_you_use_in_sqlite/)

Currently, we need to store holidays information in SQLite.

We prefer to use LocalDate in our application code.

As, Christmas always happen on 2020-12-25 doesn't matter the user is from United Kingdom, or from Thailand.

In SQLite side, we tend not to store it in INTEGER timestamp, as that requires correct timezone information.

So far, we choose to store it in TEXT.

    public class LocalDateConverter {
        // 2020-12-25
        // 2019-11-08
    
        private static final ThreadLocal&lt;DateTimeFormatter&gt; threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -&gt; {
            DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd", Locale.US);
            return formatter;
        });
    
        @TypeConverter
        public static String toString(LocalDate localDate) {
            return threadLocal.get().format(localDate);
        }
    
        @TypeConverter
        public static LocalDate toLocalDate(String string) {
            return LocalDate.parse(string, threadLocal.get());
        }
    }

I was wondering, is that a good approach?

Is there a better data type in SQLite to store LocalDate using Android Room?
## [11][Which is the security process behind Android Apk signature key and the playstore ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jk9tmv/which_is_the_security_process_behind_android_apk/)

Hi :)

When we decide to create our app we create a keystore, we decide the keystore password, the keyAlias and the keyPassword and after that we call assembleRelease.

We go to the play console and we upload our fantastic apk.

But in which way google checks the apk is signed with the correct signature key ? Which is the checks ?

Which is the role of the keystore ?
