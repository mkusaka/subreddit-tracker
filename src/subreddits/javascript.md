 Hey do you guys have any ideas of projects to improve in Javascript? I've found that learning through projects is a lot more efficient and fun than watching youtube videos. Here is what I've done so far :)

\-Meme generator (Pulls most popular memes from a subreddit)

\-Advanced calculator, has allowed me to practice my UI

\-Login System, I wanted to learn how that logins on websites worked

Have you guys worked on any exciting projects, I'm really interested in hearing about them!
