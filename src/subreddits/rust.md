Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ioc56i/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hello, I read some documentation and I think the purpose of the heap memory is to hold values in longer term and passing them to functions. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I need exactly that. I have read the Rust book but  I didn't understand how to use them. Can you please explain it in more beginner level with also explanation of how do we pass and access values between functions?

\-Thank you so much!

## [11][Removal of inactive crates from crates.io](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ivs4o1/removal_of_inactive_crates_from_cratesio/)

Today I was looking at all the crates at crates.io. As I was browsing through these crates, I saw that some crates have never been updated for a long long time like 3 years, 4 years, 5 years. Also some of the crates have almost less than 5 download. There are also no crates dependent on them.

Therefore I think that maybe we should send out emails to these crates' authors about the above information and also telling about the removal of these crates and after a given time, these crates could be removed.

And for the future, I think we should create a program to automatically go through the registry in a fixed interval and send email doing the same.
