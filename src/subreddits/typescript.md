## [2][How can I declare a const as a function that takes generics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jmch8b/how_can_i_declare_a_const_as_a_function_that/)

Given the following types, how can I declare a const `foo` of type `F` where generics of `F` must be given when using it (i.e. I want to call `foo` like this: `foo&lt;number&gt;(someValue)`)?

```
type P&lt;T&gt; = { a: T };
type R&lt;T&gt; = { b: T };
type F&lt;T&gt; = (param: P&lt;T&gt;) =&gt; R&lt;T&gt;;

// Define the dummy function here to reduce code dup.
const fn = (param: any) =&gt; ({ b: param.a });
```

Simply saying foo is of type `F` results in "Generic type 'F' requires 1 type argument(s). (2314)" so that's no good:

```
const foo: F = fn;
```

If I redefine `F` inline, it's fine:

```
const foo: &lt;T&gt;(param: P&lt;T&gt;) =&gt; R&lt;T&gt; = fn;
```

But it's a syntax error if I try declare some generic must be passed to `F`:

```
const foo: &lt;T&gt;F&lt;T&gt; = fn;
```

I think that last option is close, but I just need to figure out the right syntax. Is there a correct syntax? If not, does anyone know if there is an issue open for this (I couldn't find one)?

I have an easier time keeping track of data shape in Typescript. I will take any job though.

Is Typescript normally offered as an option during an employment algorithm test? Or is its availability during those types of tests restricted, compared to Javascript?

If the later i may practice in Javascript.

Hi Everyone, 

I am unable to understand on why is `mySquare1` valid while `mySquare2` ends up in an error?

    interface SquareConfig {
      color: string;
      width: number;
    }

    function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
      return { color: config.color || "red", area: config.width ? config.width*config.width : 20 };
    }

    let mySquare1 = { color:'red', width: 10, opacity: 15}
    let mySquare2 = createSquare(mySquare1);
    let mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, color: 'white', opacity: 15 }); // Error
    // Argument of type '{ width: number; color: string; opacity: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 
    'SquareConfig'. Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'opacity' does not exist in type 
    'SquareConfig'.

## [7][Strict version of built-in types (which use `any`)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jlhzuv/strict_version_of_builtin_types_which_use_any/)

Hello,

in Typescript, some function calls like

    const user = JSON.parse(something}
    
    console.log(user.metadata.name)

Or 

    fetch('/')
      .then(res =&gt; res.json())
      .then(user =&gt; { console.log(user.metadata.name) })

might result in runtime TypeError as they use \`any\` type for native JS and DOM APIs (instead of \`unknown\` as it didn't exist back then I suppose) .

  
(Links to definitions for the examples above: [https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/71a2c59c557d871a1d38d10df83cfc36dc10d887/lib/lib.es5.d.ts#L1059](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/71a2c59c557d871a1d38d10df83cfc36dc10d887/lib/lib.es5.d.ts#L1059) and [https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/71a2c59c557d871a1d38d10df83cfc36dc10d887/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L2557](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/71a2c59c557d871a1d38d10df83cfc36dc10d887/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L2557))

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a community version of these native types which would use \`unknown\` instead of  \`any\` for these kinds of functions?  


Or is there any other way to tackle this problem without requiring me to remember all the cases where typescript has got \`any\` as the built-in type?

Hi I'm going to start working on my first big project with Typescript using React Native. I'm still planning the whole system architecture but I need some help with how I should structure the code and files, document it, etc. Are there any resources that you would recommend for me?

Anyone have experience with pathing packages in monorepos?  I've got a monorepo with several packages, including a component library and a dashboard. I'm trying to import the component library in my dashboard package as import { Button } from '@company/ui' but it doesnt give me type definitions on my Button component unless I import from @company/ui/lib

I of course can always just import from /lib, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong here.
## [10][Justified use of an exclamation mark](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/jl87jc/justified_use_of_an_exclamation_mark/)

Hey! I just found a justified use case for an exclamation mark:

    function parse(tokens: Token[]) {
        while (tokens.length) {
            const token = tokens.shift()!;
            ...
        }
    }

Since we check `tokens.length` as part of the while loop, we can be sure `tokens.shift()` returns a token.

So far, I haven't found many other cases of exclamation mark that I could justify. Have you found any that make sense?

Hello everyone, 

this is a problem I'm trying to solve since months and I've still not found any satisfactory solution.

&amp;#x200B;

My company has been using Firebase Cloud functions for most of its activities, but we switched part of our infrastructure in a Google App Engine Container. Similar technologies, different benefits, make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm facing is that I don't really know how to share the common logic between projects. Here's some info.  


\- I'm using TS in both my projects  
\- I'd like to keep these projects private  
\- The two projects just differ in the controller part, nothing else  
\- I've setup a light CI with one of the two projects. Once I push a commit on master branch, Google Cloud Build download the repo, build it and deploy it in the App Engine container.   


How should I organize my projects? I'm not willing to stay one week more with so much duplicated business logic, but I'm not able to see a solution to my problem YET.  


Thank you
