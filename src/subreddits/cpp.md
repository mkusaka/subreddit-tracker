Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Every once in a while you find yourself with multiple vectors that represent something like different columns of the same data set:  the vectors will be of the same length, and elements at common indexes are related.  This is mostly no big deal until you want to do something fun like sort based on one of them.  I was thinking to myself how the algorithms  would work fine if I could have an iterator that iterates all n vectors at once.  Basically, have a tuple of iterators, and have that tuple itself satisfy the iterator interface by forwarding the calls to each of the elements of the tuple.  

&amp;#x200B;

I assume this isn't a wholly original idea, is there one out there written already?  Are there better solutions, other than the obvious refactoring of it into a vector of tuples/objects/structs/etc? Isn't there some trick like using an algorithm to get an ordering from the sort order vector, and using that ordering to sort the others?
## [8][Evaluating user defined logical expressions - booleval, small C++17 library](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnhmcr/evaluating_user_defined_logical_expressions/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnhmcr/evaluating_user_defined_logical_expressions/

Hi there,

For quite some time now, I have been implementing a small C++17 library [booleval](https://github.com/m-peko/booleval).

**How** ***booleval*** **library helps you?**

*booleval* library enables you to define logical expressions like *field\_a foo and field\_b 123*. Once you defined this expression, expression tree is being built by using recursive descent parser. Once the tree is built, you can pass a map of fields representing your object like:

    {
        "field_a": "foo",
        "field_b": 123
    }

This will evaluate to *true* since the condition from the logical expression is satisfied.

On the contrary, map of fields like:

    {
        "field_a": "bar",
        "field_b": 123
    }

will be evaluated to *false* since the AND logical operator is not satisfied.

**What is the use case?**

Let's say you have large number of packets coming through the network interface and you want to filter them out by the following logical expression *port 55* *or port 32*. Packets with port 55 or port 32 will pass the filter, and maybe those will be written out to the file. Other packets will be ignored.

**Supported data types:**

* string
* integer
* float
* double
* ...

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what you think about this library:

* are there any other libraries that I can include in my future benchmark?
* is there something to do to improve performance of evaluation?
* any feedback, suggestion is welcome :)
* don't forget to give it a star on Github ;)

Thanks in advance!!!

## [10][Why doesn't C++ templates have macro like token replacement?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnn0be/why_doesnt_c_templates_have_macro_like_token/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fnn0be/why_doesnt_c_templates_have_macro_like_token/
---
So I'm sure at one point or another, we've all heard the argument that macros are evil and you should use templates instead. Unfortunately, I keep running into problem sets where I could conceptually use some sort of template that generates itself based on different tokens or keywords, and am wondering if any previous proposals have been made on this topic, as well as any unforeseen challenges that may arise out of a design like this, as I'm considering the value of drafting a proposal on the matter.
Consider the following example:

    struct test { int i; char j; }; 
    template &lt;typename T&gt; auto get_i(T&amp;&amp; t) { return t._i; } 
    template &lt;typename T&gt; auto get_j(T&amp;&amp; t) { return t._j; } 
    test t{1, 'c'}; 
    auto i = get_i(t);

Consider the following proposed alternative:

    template &lt;token _member, typename T&gt; auto get_member(T&amp;&amp; t) { return t.@_member; } 
    test t{1, 'c'}; 
    auto i = get_member&lt;@i&gt;(t);

While the use of @ is merely a placeholder, .token (in the spirit of .template) may also work (and be required in the event of ambiguity). Now what about for something actually (potentially) useful?

    struct frobnicates_transmogrifies 
    { 
        int frobnicate(){ return 2; } 
        double transmogrify(){ return 3.0; } 
    }; 
    template &lt;typename T&gt; struct proxy_s 
    { 
        T t; 
        template &lt;token _Func, typename... Args&gt; auto operator()(Args&amp;&amp;... args) 
        { 
            std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__; 
            return t.@_Func(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...); 
        } 
    }; 
    
    template &lt;token... Tokens, typename T&gt; auto make_tuple_from_tokens(T&amp;&amp; t) 
    { 
        return std::make_tuple(t.@Tokens...); 
    } 
    
    using frob_tran = frobnicates_transmogrifies; 
    auto proxy = proxy{frob_tran{}}; 
    std::tuple&lt;int(proxy_s&lt;frob_tran&gt;*)(), double(proxy_s&lt;frob_tran&gt;*)()&gt; t = make_tuple_from_tokens(proxy);

Essentially, there seems to be at least some value in token replacement with compile time type safety as opposed to macros, as well as the added benefit of not having to maintain multiple functions. Since this proposed syntax would be a sort of template generator, it would be subject to the same restrictions as current templates. What are the immediate problems and pitfalls of an idea like this?
