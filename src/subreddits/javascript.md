I have a medium-sized Angular 8 application which basically fetches data from JSON apis in our backend.
Lots of logic like:

* User has marker flag A and B -&gt; show Banner A
* User has notification N (fetched from the API)
* etc

And we often render various banners for various business rules like above. The text for these banners is hardcoded into the HTML templates of the app.

Additionally, we got lots of pages with static content, some accordions and tabs, here content is fetched also from the backend, but from JSON files bundled during a build.

The problem lies that our team will get each sprint lots of boring stories like:

*  Add new accordion to page 2
* Change wording on banner K
* Change contact phone numbers for tenant Q
* Change order of banners

And so on.

I'm looking for a way to offload the team and give the business an ability to make the changes themself.
I'm exploring various CMSes, but can't find one which would fill these requirements.

* Update pages
* Change ordering of these banners
* Give ability reorder specific banners
* Ability to let other people review changes "code review for business"
* Staging/deployment.

Did somebody had a similar issue and can share how you solved this?

## [10][[AskJS] If JS object property accessor bracket notation is 1/0 no-loop direct instant access, why are we even using if/else and switch?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/fmxyl0/askjs_if_js_object_property_accessor_bracket/)

Like, I was just thinking about my code today, and a method inside an object property sounds so much better than your regular if-else. I wonder how the bracket notation compares to switch and if-else speed-wise. Theoretically, it should be so much better. 


I made a little code for you, so maybe you can do those loop-dee loop tests and tell me.
