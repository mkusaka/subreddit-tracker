**Article Intro**

The keyboard management is one of the biggest problems of the Android platform since API 1. That was almost 12 years ago. However, there are mentions of a very promising API on the horizon. In Android 11, most probably, we will finally get the control of the Soft Input Keyboard. The SDK level 30 is right now in a beta stage (July 2020) and there is currently no evidence that these functions will work on older SDKs. You can wait for a support library, that will probably be in the alpha stage for some time, or you can check what are the other options to tame the beast.

Hi all

I want to create notification in my app. But I'm really confused because of android battery optimization and network &amp; background restrictions.  I'm not sure if notification will be shown to user at exact time. My notification requeres internet connection.  I mean it will check my own api every 30 minutes and if api responses ok  it must exact time notification. Which is the best way?

## [10][Some help on whether i am calculating CPM properly for banner ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hwe6fs/some_help_on_whether_i_am_calculating_cpm/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hwe6fs/some_help_on_whether_i_am_calculating_cpm/

Hi, hypothetically:

Letâ€™s say my app has 
1. 1 banner ad on a stagnant page
2. $1 CPM + 30 seconds refresh rate. 

If there are the SAME 1000 active users viewing that page 24/7 while the 1 ad refreshes every 30 seconds.

Does that mean every 30 seconds, i will earn $1? Can CPM be counted by impressions with the same viewers? 


Also,
1. If i add 2 banner ads on the static page, does that mean $2 after 30 seconds
2. Recommended ad network for banner ads with best cpm.

Thanks. Hypothetical scenario ofc to understand how revenue is earned better :)
## [11][Automate Android/iOS app localization or minimize cost of professional translation [free offer]](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hwa3ia/automate_androidios_app_localization_or_minimize/)

Many of our users at [Hotpot.ai](https://Hotpot.ai) could not afford professional localization for their Android and iOS apps, so they would manually copy/paste from Google Translate.

Our service automates this for 70+ languages, letting you translate strings.xml files (or snippets) within seconds.

Professional translation is ideal if you can afford it.

If you can't afford professionals, a hybrid approach could help: instead of raw strings.xml files, give machine-translated ones. This allows professionals to finish faster and at lower cost because they can focus on proofreading and tricky words.

We can localize content for Android, iOS, Flutter, YouTube, Xamarin, and other platforms.

How it works: (1) upload strings.xml file or paste in strings.xml snippets; (2) pick languages; (3) download files.

We can offer this sub free localization. Just comment if you would like a promo code, and please share feedback. Please don't DM as Reddit search is horrible.
