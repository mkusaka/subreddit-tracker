This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

So I have seen many weird play console posts here but I found something bizarre with one of my apps today. In one of my app, Total number of installs (Lifetime) is 167k and Total number of uninstalls(Lifetime) 168k. Also, Active devices (Lifetime) is 43k. Numbers don't quite add up.

[Uninstalls](https://imgur.com/a/BAPTTVG)  
[Devices](https://imgur.com/a/CBdb6U6)  


Has anybody faced/seen this in any of your apps before? was just curious if I'm the only one.

I am getting duplicate account issue even though I haven't created any other account. My adsense account is still in the process of getting setup, payments page in admob shows only one user (me). I'm not understanding which account are they referring to and I still haven't even linked my app from admob.
PS - Using separate email ID for admob account now cz I had got same error on my developer account i used on play store, hence cancelled it and created a new one.

I have an account where I publish an app. I cannot change the name of app and publisher account because I only want to associate that account with apps related to a single product.

So, I want to create another publisher account ofcourse with another email id for some other ideas that I have but my doubts:

\- Will using the same PC for developing and publishing apps for separate accounts a good idea.

\- If one of the publisher account gets suspended, can it affect other account's presence/apps?

I was just exploring the Android Vitals and realized that my app warm startup time is 21% more than the median. So I went into further details and came across this graph.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ct3qmqgvriw41.png?width=1516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38d7de4cf533b0974c14507121e99e69148a219

The Y-axis shows sessions (which I don't know what Google is calling a session) and on the X-axis it shows startup time. Which is given in milliseconds. 

Now the problem is, if I hover over any bar, it shows me the time span in milliseconds that my app took to start but what are those sessions?  Is it telling me that 4136 of the **total sessions** took 750-875 milliseconds to start? If so then total sessions of how many days? There is no option/anything like that. 

Can someone untangle this, please?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks
