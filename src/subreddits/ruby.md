I just found out about this new static site generator. Thought I would share it with the community. https://github.com/algolia/frontman

A while ago, I wrote a debugging tool called [tapping\_device](https://github.com/st0012/tapping_device) and received some pretty good responses here. So today I want to introduce another new tool I'm working on recently: [power\_trace](https://github.com/st0012/power_trace). 

It adds all the information we desperately need to exception backtraces:

1. Local variables
2. Method call arguments
3. Instance variables defined in the frame

And it now supports integration with `rails`, `minitest` and `rspec`

Here's an example output of the `rspec` integration

Please give it a try let me know what you think about it ðŸ˜„
