I wanted to create a class that allowed me to pass lots of information for debugging purposes. Based on the Type of Debug message, different sections of the resulting Console message will have different colors.

I would like to get feedback from you guys.
Comments, questions, suggestions all welcome

I'm new to github as well so please let me know if that link doesn't work.

Thanks!

Hi all, just curious how one goes about discriminating a union as arguments to a function, so I can implement a factory method.

I essentially want something like:
```
type PUSH_TYPE = 'ONE' | 'TWO'

type ActionOne = {
  type: 'ONE'
  payload: { thing: string }
}

type ActionTwo = {
  type: 'TWO'
  payload: { differentThing: string }
}

type Action&lt;PUSH_TYPE&gt; = ActionOne | ActionTwo

const discriminate = &lt;R = PUSH_TYPE&gt;(
  type: R,
  payload: Action&lt;R&gt;['payload'],
): Action&lt;R&gt; =&gt; {}
```
Basically, I want the type system / autocomplete to know which payload must be specified once the type is provided. Is this possible? Appreciate the help!

I'm using ts-node and jest. Launching a test takes forever. Typescript takes about 1-10 seconds more to launch than simple node. There doesn't seem to be any feature to tell me which files are taking the longest so there's no way to optimize. My project is rather large, hundreds of files, 100k lines+. Some files are required dynamically, which might cause a problem but no way to really know how much of a problem it is.

That's really my question, I just don't understand what they are exactly. That doesn't mean I can't use them, but don't understand what function they serve in my code?   Thanks in advance.

## [10][decoupling a complex set of generic interfaces from its much simpler TypeScript code](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f5of1v/decoupling_a_complex_set_of_generic_interfaces/)

I am writing a TypeScript library, and I am trying to add generics to the public-facing functions in order to the strengthen their type checking and improve IDE autosuggestions. The problem is that the generics end up needing to be passed all throughout the codebase because some of the public-facing functions are also used internally. And the generic types are also a bit complex, with multiple parameters, ternary logic, lookups, and references to other custom generic types. I don't want to rewrite every function with these new types. The public-facing functions need them, the internals do not.

I want to write the generic types so that they behave as the library's interface but do not affect any of the existing internal code. Like a layer that just sits in front, completely decoupled, much like how type declaration files are for JS files. Can a TypeScript library have its own declaration files? How would you suggest I solve this?

Is it possible to write a generic TS function for recursively flattening an arbitrarily nested array?

For example:

    const input = [1,[2,[3,[4,[5],6],7],8],9];
    const output = flattenDeep(input); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

This is pretty simple to write in JS

    function flattenDeep(array) {
      const result = [];
      for(const value of array) {
        if(Array.isArray(value)) {
          result.push(...flattenDeep(value));
        } else {
          result.push(value);
        }
      }
      return result;
    }

But is there a way to add generic types to this, so it will infer the input/output types in the example above?
