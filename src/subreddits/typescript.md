Hello all,

I am starting with Typescript and I would like to disable ESLint for JS files, my .eslintrc.json contains the following:

```
    "parser":  "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    "extends": [
        "airbnb",
        "prettier",
        "prettier/react",
        "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended",
        "plugin:jest/recommended"
        // "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
    ],
    "overrides": [
      {
        "files": ["*.js", "*.jsx"],
        "rules": {
            "@typescript-eslint/...": "off"
        }
      }
    ],

```

But I continue getting eslint messages due to "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended". Any help with this please?

Thank you in advance and regards.
## [8][Trying to set type for single, dynamic property of indexed type](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f6gudt/trying_to_set_type_for_single_dynamic_property_of/)

I have a variety of records that look like this:
```typescript
{
   id: string;
   fields: number[];
   field1: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;;
}

{
   other_id: string;
   more_fields: number[];
   field2: number
}
```

I'm trying to set the typing on a function where you pass the property name of the `number[]` field to the function so it knows where to grab the numbers from.

Something like:
```typescript
function sum_fields&lt;T, K extends keyof T &amp; number[]&gt;(obj: T, field: K): number {
  let sum = 0;
  obj[field].forEach((i: number) =&gt; {
      sum += i;
  });
  return sum;
}
```

How can I tell typescript that the property name I'm passing in has the type number[], and/or can I get typescript complain if the type of field is *not* number[]?

I wanted to create a class that allowed me to pass lots of information for debugging purposes. Based on the Type of Debug message, different sections of the resulting Console message will have different colors.

I would like to get feedback from you guys.
Comments, questions, suggestions all welcome
