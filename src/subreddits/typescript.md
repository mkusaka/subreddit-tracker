The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring company—no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job. 

Posting top level comments that aren't job postings, [that's a paddlin](https://i.imgur.com/FxMKfnY.jpg)

I noticed some weird behavior and I wonder if any of you have seen this before.

**1. So, in the end it boils down to this problem:**

    type Z = ((p: true) =&gt; void) | ((p: false) =&gt; void)
    const z: Z = 0 as any;
    z(true); // argument of type 'true' is not assignable to argument of type 'never'

The type Z is being generated by typescript (which is another weird story, see blow), but why does the above combine to a parameter of type never?

**2. What originally brings me to this problem:**

In my original code, I try to infer the promise type and return a function type, which takes the promise type as parameter. Simplified code:

    type SampleFun = () =&gt; Promise&lt;boolean&gt;;
    type X = ReturnType&lt;SampleFun&gt; extends Promise&lt;infer TP&gt;
            ? (TP extends void
                ? () =&gt; void
                : (result: TP) =&gt; void)
            : () =&gt; void;
    // X = ((result: false) =&gt; void) | ((result: true) =&gt; void)

Why does it not create a simple function with parameter boolean?

I'm guessing these are issues I should report to the TypeScript team, but before I bug them, I wanted to see if anyone else noticed one of these and is aware of existing issues (as searching the \~4500 issues on github is painful).

The only thing I could find somewhat related was this one:[https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31663](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31663)
## [6][When are parenthesis not redundant?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/gmhh6c/when_are_parenthesis_not_redundant/)

Context: I'm working on adding intersection types + parenthesis support to [typecheck.macro](https://github.com/vedantroy/typecheck.macro).

It seems like parenthesis are redundant in most cases. Examples:

(A | B)\[\] = Array&lt;A | B&gt;

(A) = A

(A | B) | (C &amp; D) = A | B | C &amp; D because Typescript implicitly does parenthesize for you

It seems like the only place parenthesis affect the order of "type operations" is:

A &amp; (B | C ) =  A &amp; B | A &amp; C. 

Can someone correct me if I am wrong?
## [7][typecheck.macro - Automatically generate validation functions for Typescript types.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/glyq1m/typecheckmacro_automatically_generate_validation/)

10 days ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ges5r9/auto_generate_typechecker_from_typescript_types/) asking whether it was possible to automatically generate validation functions for Typescript types. Unfortunately, it seemed like that was not the case.

So I built a library (well, compile time macro) to do it: [https://github.com/vedantroy/typecheck.macro](https://github.com/vedantroy/typecheck.macro)

 Once you configure babel macros, you can seamlessly generate validation functions for your Typescript types. No need to write your types again in a DSL (like runtypes/zod/io-ts). Compile time macros automatically parse your type declarations and generate validation functions.

The library is pretty fresh, but it already handles unions/tuple types/optional types/index signatures/interfaces (no extending yet)/type aliases/generics/object patterns/arrays, so it's pretty functional/usable.

The resulting validation functions are also really fast because most other libraries (except ajv) don't do compile time code generation. After some bench marking (not that I'm a benchmarking expert), I found it was up to 3 times as fast as ajv.

This is my first open source library, so I'm excited to hear what you guys think!

Above all, I feel like this can be a community effort. I'm open to suggestions/any form of feedback/contribution/etc.

I'm reading Boris Cherny's "Programming TypeScript" book. At one point he defines the distinction between Type Level and Value Level code. He notes that – as a general rule – if it's valid TypeScript but not valid JavaScript then it's Type Level code.

One of the exceptions to this rule is Enums. I've avoided using Enums in my TypeScript for sometime, and those definitions give me the vocabulary to describe why. I think TypeScript should be _purely_ a type annotation system and _not_ provide Value Level extensions to the language.

Am I the only one that feels this way? Can anyone describe the rationale for including something like Enums in TypeScript? It feels out of scope, and I think all the functionality provided by Enums can be provided through JavaScript constants and Type Level Typescript.

Hello, so I have a current REST express API project where I am using TypeORM to model my database entities. I was wondering if I were to use ts-node for a runtime console script, (or possibly DENO), if I were able to reuse my assets like my entity models within these runtime scripts?
