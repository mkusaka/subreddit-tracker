hi. I am new to Kotlin, "Gradle and the Kotlin DSL" build system. I am not new to programming though. I am using Intellij. I am trying to learn kotlin and the gradle build system using kotlin dsl all at the same time. And it is super confusing. Nothing seems straight forward. I am not new to programming at all by any stretch. But I am new to kotlin and the entire java ecosystem. And I want to learn this as soon as possible because, I will start work on a very large kotlin/gradle project at work very soon.

At the moment, I am trying to do the following just to test out the kotlin language, and learn more about the gradle/kotlin DSL build system.

1. create a kotlin project with gradle/kotlinDSL as build system
2. add the fuel (http client) as a dependency.
3. use fuel to make a http request.

At the moment I am stuck at "adding fuel as a dependency". In intellij, I added fuel as a dependency in project settings but still i keep getting "unresolved reference"


Here are some of the problems I faced and does not seem straight-forward for someone that has been coding professionally for a long time, but is very new to the java ecosystem.

* couldn't find the one package manager. python has pypi. rust has crates. c# has nuget. So I naively assumed I would find something like that in the java/jvm/kotlin world. Oh boy, how wrong I was.
* theres like 10 different JDKs. I am not sure which one is the most used and which one I should use.
* confusion about what the JDK is. Is it the compiler , runtime and standard libraries. ?
* there is jscentral. maven central. and many others. Are they repositories of java libraries? kotlin libraries? or a combination of both.
* can i use any java libary with kotlin? Or are there some java libraries that won't work with kotlin? If so how do I tell if a java library will not work with kotlin
* are libraries restricted to working on only certain SDKs and not others?
* what is a module? can modules exist within other modules? In the c# world a solution can have many projects. Is it something like that?

I have so many other questions and If I seem frustrated, my apologies. I have been trying to get fuel added as a dependency and It just wont work. I've been trying to work this out for the past one day.

Otherwise, I think kotlin is a beauty. I just wish it was easier to understand the ecosytem.

Any help or document/tutorial/book that will help me to answer some or all these questions will be appreciated.

Recently I created a minimal app to illustrate the power of kotlin multiplatform. It currently runs on:

* Android (available on Google Play)
* iOS
* Web

I want to know if I can use Kotlin for Competitive programming without taking support of Java(Java collections).
Is there anyone here who uses kotlin for cp? 
If so would you like to share the details :)
## [5][Kotlin doesn't have its won collections library. Is it still like that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/j4sbjy/kotlin_doesnt_have_its_won_collections_library_is/)

I'm reading right now the book called "[Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action)" and something caught my eye, the following paragraph say:

&gt;*Another area where Kotlin focuses on interoperability is its use of existing Java libraries to the largest degree possible. For example, Kotlin doesnâ€™t have its own collections library. It relies fully on Java standard library classes, extending them with additional functions for more convenient use in Kotlin.* 

Is Kotlin still like the paragraph mentioned above?

I am injecting repositories in the viewmodel using hilt but there is a variable which i am getting in the activity. I need to pass the value of that variable from activity to the viewmodel and i thought viewmodel factories might help. But how do i use them along with hilt?

## [10][When coroutineScope.cancel() has any real advantage over coroutineScope.coroutineContext.cancelChildren()?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/j4eerj/when_coroutinescopecancel_has_any_real_advantage/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/j4eerj/when_coroutinescopecancel_has_any_real_advantage/

If I do `coroutineScope.coroutineContext.cancelChildren()`, then all coroutines within that scope are cancelled, but the scope itself can be used going forward to launch new ones.

If I do `coroutineScope.cancel()`, then all coroutines are cancelled as well, but, in addition, the scope itself becomes "dead", silently ignoring any new attempts to launch new coroutines in it.

My question is: what's the added benefit of cancelling the scope itself? In other words, is there any use case when just cancelling scope's children is not enough?
