I was bored, so I made this music app with the help of `electron` and `react` in typescript.

It can play music out of any directory you choose and can even download songs into that directory. It stores metadeta about each song and shows you all artists and albums which the songs are from and stores youre last queue so you can pickup where you left off.

The project is far from perfect and any suggestions will be welcome.

PS:

 I use linux so I'm not sure if there will be any bugs in mac or windows

Also you require a Napster API key(for music metadata) and a Google API key(for downloading a video) for proper functionality

Hi, I have a use case where I need to pass a reference to a method and the parameters to call it with at a later point. How do I validate that the parameters are valid upon declaration?

Example of what I need:

```
interface Foo {
    method: Function
    params: /* Parameters of whatever is passed to "method" */
}

const api = {
    method: async (a: number, b: string) =&gt; {},
}

// This should compile
const foo: Foo = {
    method: api.method,
    params: [3, 'baz']
}

// This should NOT compile
const bar: Foo = {
    method: api.method,
    params: ['wrong', 3]
}
```
## [11][TypeORM relationship - relationships by id ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ff0hcr/typeorm_relationship_relationships_by_id/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ff0hcr/typeorm_relationship_relationships_by_id/

I've been kinda confused by the relationships as I'm used to save relationship by id, while docs and examples I found suggest to get the entire object and use that instead (Isn't this strange???)

I found this on github addressing this issue ( [https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/447](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/447) ) , where they suggest to use an object with just the id property, but it's from 2017. Is that a good way to do it ? And is it still the only way to do it ? (I find it pretty lame tbh)

    async create( @Body() product: Product) {
        product.category = &lt;any&gt;{ id: product.category };
        return { payload: await this.repository.persist(product) };
    }

Another one suggested to name the column as categoryId and it would work as expected (with id instead of object) but WHY? What does the name have to do with that ??

    @Entity()
    class Product {
    
         @Column({ type: "int", nullable: true })
         categoryId: number;
    
         @ManyToOne(type =&gt; Category)
         @JoinColumn({ name: "categoryId" })
         category: Category;
    
    }

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just confused, help \^\_\^
