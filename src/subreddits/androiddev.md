This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

## [7][Why should I learn native Android and not Flutter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gotdye/why_should_i_learn_native_android_and_not_flutter/)

I started learning Android years back when Kotlin wasnt in the picture got to some point and gave up. Then flutter appeared and I got into it. For some reason people who are already native developers in Kotlin, have no intentions of considering Flutter. Why? I find native to be over complicated without a reason. For example api request. In Kotlin I saw this Volley library being used. Its quite a code. While in flutter all you have to type is http.get(url). Thats it you made the request. So whats the deal? I cant really make up my mind which path to choose.

Assisted Injection.... talk to me.

Background is that I want to use ViewModel Save State Handle with a DI library (Dagger in my case but I suppose could be anything). The guidance is either use Square Assisted Inject or due to *complications* write your own ViewModelFactory.

That's cool and all I don't need help writing the factory, I just want a bit more elaboration on why  Assisted Inject is overkill or too complicated for this use or any pitfalls you might think is relevant.

Internet bonus points if there's a super useful advantage to Assisted Inject that isn't Saved State Handle that I haven't considered.

Iâ€™m trying to implement an audio recorder that runs when I press the button, and it keeps running in the background even when Iâ€™m outside of the app. I already got the audio recorder to work, and tried to implement IntentService but failed to pass the data (maximum amplitude) from the IntentService back to MainActivity. Can anyone give me some guidance on this? Thanks!
