We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey all, I work for a relatively large company and we are in the process of moving an old java struts application over to react. There are many teams of developers who would work on multiple components and the fear of the monolith is real. The current release process is a nightmare! Ideally teams look after their own areas in their own repos.

There is currently an implementation of SSR components which would mean that you could pull components in without having to make sure that you have the latest version, but it feels like itâ€™s adding a whole lot of overhead and a bit of a weird dev experience. 

What are some practices that you know of that get around this kind of issue? 

Thanks for your help in advance!

Hi guys,

I'm currently working on a project and am trying to add coding rules and autoformating.

For a while I've been using prettier, eslint and vscode.

The current project is setup with CRA + TS.

If I can \`editor.codeActionsOnSave\` with vscode and put formatting rules with eslint (airbnb rules). Do i still need Prettier for anything? 

Could I just use Eslint rules and VScode to autoformat?

# Hi everyone,

### Many times in large or even small projects, we forgot some components in code that we'll never use and we never take time to search one by one and remove.

#### Recently I've launched npm package to find dead components in project.
