This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Just released NoCopy, a Kotlin compiler plugin that enables using data classes as value-based classes by moderating usage of their \`copy\` method.

Good afternoon, I am looking to create a simple app with 122 questions that will randomize the questions and answers every time you take or restart the quiz. Is there any database that people share open source apps?

This app was created during me learning Flutter, as I wanted to experiment with some kind of CRUD, and shared preferences as well as implementation of dark theme. Since this app, I have been able to learn much more and even landed myself an internship. 
I finally decided to compile this, and publish it, as some people may find something like this useful.

A very simple app created to track habits or chores or any
particular task.
Provides simple counters and an easy to use interface. 
Deleting a counter is as simple as swiping it away.

A dark theme also exists, for ease of use at night.

Hope you all check it out.

I'm thinking of an app idea which involves showing apps by other developers. Like show list of them and user can follow the Google Play url to download it. Does it violate Google Play policy?

My background includes programming and project management with a software/SaaS dev team for a few years.

I am looking to create my own app and I'm trying to figure out how to start.  It seems there are many options with programming languages, frameworks, etc.

My app is like a point of interest finder.  So it will be doing geolocating, and pulling POI data from someplace like Google, Factual or Sygic.

I know I want to use SQLite to store some info local for speed, and to cut down on API calls.   Still debating building my own database of POI specific for my app to further save on API calls.  Should I use something like MySQL, or a JSON approach like MongoDB?

I looked at no-code places like [appery.io](https://appery.io) and AppyPie but could quite figure them out.  The front end is pretty straight forward, it everything on the back end that's complicated.  So... I'm looking for suggestions on where to start.  Android SDK?   Java, Kotlin, C++?  Any suggestions for some quick tutorials to get me started?  Code snippets (other than StackOverflow)?

THANKS!!!
## [12][NSFW ad networks for android apps?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hj91y5/nsfw_ad_networks_for_android_apps/)

Anyone got any experience with NSFW ad networks on android? or is there one that allows NSFW apps? I have used exoclick. Pretty good so far on revenue. Support is A+ as well. only drawback is the implementation of the library which uses webviews (not too gentle on recyclerviews and also can be a security concern). thanks :)
