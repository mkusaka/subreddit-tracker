[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source web framework created for Kotlin/JS. It allows developers to build modern web applications with the Kotlin language.

I have released KVision 3.8.0. The highlights of this release include:

* added new `className` parameter to all DSL builder functions for better React-like HTML markup
* simplified state binding functions
* added root panel container types from Bootstrap 4.4
* upgraded dependencies: Coroutines 1.3.6, Spring Boot 2.2.7, Jooby 2.8.2, Bootstrap Select 1.13.17
* bugfixes and improvements for different components

For more details about this release see the [changelog](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision/releases/tag/3.8.0).

Don't forget to ⭐️ my [project](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) if you like it :-)

Any feedback is appreciated.

I'd like to be able edit and run the app from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mustafaozhan/CosmeticScan) on my mac. I noticed it has a batch file so I'm unsure of whether I'll be able to do this. What would be the best IDE to use?

(Sorry about my little knowledge of Kotlin, I'm a web developer).

We wrote our native app as a hybrid app using Kotlin JS. We find it a better development experience than Native Kotlin. Here's a blog post documenting our experience.
