 I got an internship for summer and I am free for 4 months and as JavaScript is my favorite programming language, and it has a huge community, I want to develop some library that can be used with npm or standalone js applications..... Whatever I think of there is a library out there for it...can someone please tell me about some library which could be useful and not already present?

Hi people, some time ago I wrote this query builder thing ChegoJS. I would like to get back to it and improve. In my free time I focus on bug fixing etc. But do you have some ideas what would be nice to add?

I'm passionate about simplifying web topics (which I know or can learn) as possible as I can.

For example, you can check out how I simplified Javascript Promises in this article - https://thewebfor5.com/p/javascript/javascript-promises/

So I'm throwing out this question.

Do you have any web topic (most especially Javascript) which you find difficult to comprehend?

If yes, state them in the comments and I'll do my best on them.

I'm trying to use this means to learn and to also help out. Thanks.
