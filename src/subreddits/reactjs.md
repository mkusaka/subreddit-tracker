We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi everyone, I created a tutorial to create a stopwatch app.

I wanted to give a brief intro of what typescript could do for you by checking types in variables and returning types in functions.

I hope this is helpful for someone.

## [7][When to use getState inside of redux-thunk?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gnb7yj/when_to_use_getstate_inside_of_reduxthunk/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gnb7yj/when_to_use_getstate_inside_of_reduxthunk/
---
Hi there, I have a question about redux-thunk and the proper usage of `getState` argument during the dispatching of actions. 

I have the following app:

I'm building a "dashboard" so to say it, where you can apply several filters and whatnot. I'm sending these filters to backend where I filter the results and display them on front. 

Now the thing is, which of these approaches is more correct:

    export const fetchExamplesFromCategory = (targetCategory, queryString, index) =&gt; {
        return dispatch =&gt; {
            axios.get('/api/' + targetCategory + queryString)
            .then(resp =&gt; {
                const targetExample = resp.data[index];
                dispatch(saveExamples(targetExample, resp.data.length));
            });
        };
    }

Or this one:

    export const fetchExamplesFromCategory = () =&gt; {
        return (dispatch, getState) =&gt; {
            const curState = getState();
            axios.get('/api/' + curState.targetCategory + curState.queryString)
            .then(resp =&gt; {
                const targetExample = resp.data[curState.index];
                dispatch(saveExamples(targetExample, resp.data.length));
            });
        };
    }

So just to explain the difference here. I have other actions where I increase index and change category/query. The data is retrieved only in this action.

In the course through which I was learning React, it was mentioned that `getState` should be avoided if possible, however this usecase already seems a bit more complicated than anything in that course.

PS. Is this the proper subreddit to post questions? I found /r/learnreactjs to be relatively small, but if it is better to post there, I will in future. Thanks.

I need to create many components in react to show clusters, nodes, pods like in the image bellow.

[https://photos.app.goo.gl/bTdwUtB6NLfn3zei7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bTdwUtB6NLfn3zei7)

I tried [react-d3-graph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-graph) but it doesn't seem to allow multiple line links between nodes. I also tried react-vis but it seems limited in terms of styling.
