Hi All,

I have recently become interested in the web performance side of web development. I'm wondering if the way I'm calculating the amount of time it takes a block of code to run correct and trustworthy?

Essentially what I do is wrap a console.time(), and a console.timeEnd around a block of code like so.

    function copyToClipboard1(e) {
        console.time('Exec #1');
        const clipboard = emailInput;
        clipboard.value = this.value;
        clipboard.select();
        document.execCommand("copy");
        console.timeEnd('Exec #1');
    }

This then returns something like this `Navigator #1:` [`0.0869140625ms`](https://0.0869140625ms.Is)`.` Is this an efficient way of calculating the speed of a code block. The result each time are usually similar enough?
