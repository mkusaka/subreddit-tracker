We alternate between **Who's Hiring** (on the 1st of the month, [most recent one here][hiring:most recent]) and **Who's Available** (on the 15th, [most recent one here][available:most recent])

Welcome to **the biggest React job board in the world!** This is like Hacker News' **Who's Hiring** but just for React. Top Level comments must be **Job Opportunities.**

‚ö†Ô∏è NEW: WE ARE REQUESTING EVERYBODY FOLLOW [THE HN Who's Hiring FORMAT][format:hiring:hn]

**Company inc. | Job Title | City/State Location | Full-time/Part-Time | On-site/Remote | (Optional) Salary range | Website jobs page, other hard requirements etc.**

examples:

- **Thorn | San Francisco or Remote (US based) | Full-time Contract | $100k - $150k | Software Engineer | https://www.wearethorn.org/**
- **PolicyStat | Full-Stack Python+Django Software Engineer | Indianapolis, Vancouver, or REMOTE | Full Time | +\$80k**

Please include as much information as possible. **If you are remote-friendly, or open to sponsoring work visas to your country, say so! These are the top 2 questions!**

If you are looking for jobs, send a PM to the poster or post in our [Who's Available thread!][available:most recent]

Hey everyone, I thought a lot of us would be starting out on learning React during this time of quarantine. The video is my take on learning React in 2020. Hopefully it will help you if you're learning React at the moment.

I also create content on React so I have created a few playlists to help you.

Hello, I'm a senior web developer with almost six years of working experience in the industry. My strong-suite is definitely front-end, and because of our company's standards, I haven't really been able to keep up with any recent technologies or libraries. I'm very interested in React and have already started out with the basics, but I find my motivation slowly vanishing without friends or co-workers backing me up.

I'm by no means an expert in JavaScript, as my work usually focuses heavily on HTML/CSS.

With that said, I have my own training project which I do intend to make a functional service. **It would be helpful if you, the person interested in this suggestion** had any kind of background with video games as a hobby, as my project is heavily focused on serving as a tool for gamers.

I would really appreciate it if you'd wish to learn with me or help me learn. What I would suggest is creating a small channel of like-minded people in Discord, where we could discuss (text chat preferred) and develop our skills with React! :)

‚öõÔ∏è Question on React state management ‚öõÔ∏è

**Can you guess which code snippet is more efficient and why?**

  1. Custom hook.


```jsx
function Page() {
  const { values, setValue } = useForm();

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Header /&gt;
      &lt;Navigation /&gt;
      &lt;SomeOtherThirdPartyComponent&gt;
      &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;input value={values.name} onChange={e =&gt; {
          setValue("name", e.target.value);
        }}/&gt;
        &lt;input value={values.email} onChange={e =&gt; {
          setValue("email", e.target.value);
        }}/&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
      &lt;Footer /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
```

 2. Wrapper with render prop.


```jsx
function Page() {
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Header /&gt;
      &lt;Navigation /&gt;
      &lt;SomeOtherThirdPartyComponent&gt;
      &lt;FormManager&gt;
        {({ values, setValue }) =&gt; (
          &lt;form&gt;
            &lt;input value={values.name} onChange={e =&gt; {
              setValue("name", e.target.value);
            }}/&gt;
            &lt;input value={values.email} onChange={e =&gt; {
              setValue("email", e.target.value);
            }}/&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
        )}
      &lt;/FormManager&gt;
      &lt;Footer /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
```

Both are doing the same: **form state management**.
