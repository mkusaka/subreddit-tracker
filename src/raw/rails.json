Over the past month, I've completely rewritten my homepage from scratch, in Ruby using Rails. This was my very first real Rails project and I'm so proud that I can finally say that it's (nearly) completed.\n\nI come from a background of many languages, but mostly php. Don't get me wrong, php is an awesome language and if you're interested in a typed scripting language with a Java-like OOP system, then php is probably your best bet.\n\nI've been doing web development in my freetime for nearly 4 years now and I really lost interest lately. The only app that I was still maintaining was my homepage. It had a pretty old php code base from when I was a complete newbie to software development.\n\nFrom side projects which I had long since discontinued, I gained much, much more knowledge in software development and became what I would consider to be quite a good developer. My homepage was my only project left that was not a library or small tool, and considering its age, I thought of rewriting it.\n\nLong story short, I couldn't bring up the motivation. Started it a few times using different frameworks, but always discontinued the project after a few days. I think I just knew my stack too well and got bored of it. In the end, it was just repeating the same tasks I did a thousand times already, once again. I think you could say that I was in some kind of coding depression.\n\nI came to the conclusion that I needed to learn a new framework or maybe even a whole new language. I tried PHP/Slim, PHP/Symfony (granted, that really was not new to me...), Python/Django and even a few more.\n\nAfter looking for more frameworks to try, I found Rails. I already knew Rails (not really), because I dabbled with it around 2 years ago. Back then, I dropped it because I neither understood Rails nor Ruby. Having heard great things about Ruby and Rails and having seen the Ruby community as really friendly, calm devs whose projects \"just work\", I really got interested in it again.\n\nI started learning Ruby using [the Programming Ruby book](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) and Rails using several YouTube tutorials and blogs. I felt as if Rails is the right thing for my homepage, so I started working on it (based off of a 45min YouTube video, even though the code base has completely changed since then).\n\nAfter having understood Rails' basics (where does it get the views/layouts from, how does webpacker work, how do all the helpers work, how do I validate input, how do I query a database, ...), it became pretty easy and I could work on it all by myself, no tutorial needed anymore.\n\nI still ran into quite some problems (looking through my post history, I made 9 posts on here over the past month), which I consulted you guys for. All my questions got answered! And this is just a big thank you to all of you! This community gave me a really warm welcome and I feel right at home here. I joined this sub when I started my Rails journey and in the future I'd like to help others new to Rails too. Rails has an incredibly awesome community.\n\nAlso, the people from Stack Overflow, numerous blogs around the web, YouTubers making tutorials and developers writing libraries, deserve all an equally big thank you. To me, it feels like those resources are often not appreciated as much as they should be.\n\nMy site is now live and I'm going to Open Source it very soon. I'd love to post a link, but I don't want my Reddit account to be associated with my homepage/IRL personality.\n\nSo, again, thank you to all of you! ;)", "author_fullname": "t2_1vwkt1vm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Just a big thank you!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rails", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_j5hz32", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1601927451.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.rails", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: lost interest in web dev, learnt Rails, have just completed rewriting my old homepage; thanks to the Rails community for helping me get through this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi!
