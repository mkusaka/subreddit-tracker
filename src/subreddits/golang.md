I have a question about DDD and Golang. Well to be fair, I think my problem it‚Äôs understand DDD. But I think I know how DDD is built... but all examples of DDD in Golang is weird to me. 

For each Domain you must have a folder? For example, for products domain, you must have Infrastructure, Interface, Application, etc. And then for User domain you must replicate again same folders?

I'm new to go.

I've been through the tutorials and am comfortable with the language so far. I now want to write a web app (backend api).

But I think using go *by itself* will be difficult and probably a waste of time.

I typically use C# and ASP.NET Core - in which case there is a difference between the language (c#) and the web framework (asp.net core). ASP.NET does an incredible amount of stuff - config, ioc/di, auth, routing, validation, db work using an ORM, server-side rendering (if you want it), etc.

Is there an ASP.NET Core equivalent in the go world?

I found dozens of options, but can't tell which is the most stable and heavily used by the go community.
