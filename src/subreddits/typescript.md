Instead of 

&amp;#x200B;

    constructor(public x: string){
    
    }
    get x () {
       
      return x;
    }

Why not just do 

&amp;#x200B;

    constructor(public x: string){
    
    }
    
    console.log(class.x)
    
    or even
    
    y = "y";
    constructor(public x: string){
    
    }
    console.log(class.y);

Trying to create an `Entry` class to be used in a hash map. I need to constrain a generic type in a constructor, but Typescript is giving me a weird type error.

Parameter 'key' of constructor from exported class has or is using private name ''

I'm exporting `Hashable` though.

If you replace `Hashable` with string: `key: K extends string` it still gives the same type error.

Why?

I'm trying to create a multi-tenant architecture. For this, I want to create a new EntityManager  
or Repository that automatically annotates all queries with an additional filter for the tenant\_id.

A query like:

    createQueryBuilder() 
        .select("user") 
        .from(User, "user") 
        .where("user.id = :id", { id: "[...]" })

Should be automatically transformed by the Repository or Manager to a query like:

    createQueryBuilder() 
        .select("user") .from(User, "user") 
        .where("user.id = :id", { id: "[...]" }) 
        .andWhere("user.tenantId = :tenantId", { tenantId: "[...]" });

Is this possible with TypeORM?

(The benefit with this approach is that it is more fault-tolerant since it would be impossible to forget filtering for the right tenant)

Hi there. I just wonder if there a possible way to get a property names from a type, not an object. I tried do somethng like this:

    export type Names&lt;T&gt; = {readonly [K in keyof T]: K};
    
    export interface Test {
      myLuck2: number;
      myBad: string;
    };
    
    export function nameof&lt;TClass&gt;(callback: (obj: Names&lt;TClass&gt;) =&gt; keyof TClass): keyof TClass {
      const names: Names&lt;TClass&gt; = {
        // Here I can't define same properties as in Names&lt;TClass&gt; dynamicly =(
      };
      return callback(names);
    };
    
    export const TestNameOfSomeProperty = nameof&lt;Test&gt;(x =&gt; x.myLuck2);

And, of course, I can't convert string type literal to value string... AFAIK. Maybe there is an issue or pull request?

So, I have a react app and my Webstorm is just not appropriately linting things. Everything seems to be building fine, but all my ".js" files are littered with linting errors EVEN though I pre-commit with linting and its fine.

Can you look over my babel, eslintrc file and let me know if anything jumps out as incorrect or "out of ordering". I am trying TRYING to ONLY use typescript on ".ts/.tsx" files and ignore the '.js' files for typing... basically "oh its a .js, ignore typescript linting etc...".

HERE IS WHAT MY WEBSTORM IS SHOWING AS ERRORS. These are ".js" files. I have used Webstorm on all my projects and never any issues... even when jump to other repos, all good. So, I am thinking its my introducing with typescript to this project,  as my other projects do not use it. Anybody see any issues? Remember, I want to use both ".js" and ".ts" extensions.. and only "type" the ts files.

errors webstorm show. Its crazy. It doesn't seem to recognize the js/jsx, YET I verified over and over that i have the proper settings (see last image).

## [9][How would you implement a Map with objects (vectors) as keys?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hcrtdx/how_would_you_implement_a_map_with_objects/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hcrtdx/how_would_you_implement_a_map_with_objects/
---
I want to store where figures are on a game board.

Positions on the board are of the type 'Vector' which has an x and an y attribute. The figures are of type Entity, but for simplicitys sake here they are just strings:

    class Vector {
        constructor(readonly x: number, readonly y: number) {
        }
    
        equals(other: this): boolean {
            return this.x === other.x &amp;&amp; this.y === other.y;
        }
    }
    
    const board = new Map&lt;Vector, string&gt;();
    board.set(new Vector(0, 1), "white pawn");
    board.set(new Vector(4, 0), "white king");
    
    console.log(board.get(new Vector(4, 0)));  // prints "undefined" - not what I want

I understand now that the Map class compares keys by their identity / memory address. Two distinct objects are considered not the same key, even if the equals method returns true.

*What would be the most elegant and efficient way to implement a type of Map that considers keys to be equivalent if they are structurally equal or an "equals" method would return true?*

On [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57262315/how-to-get-deep-equality-of-keys-in-es6-map-alternative-to-using-complex-object), they suggested using strings as keys. I'm uncomfortable with using strings in program logic. Maybe that's just a bad practice in other programming languages but okay in Javascript/Typescript? The typechecker couldn't warn me if I tried to insert an invalid key like `"Vecdor(y:  4,x=2)"`.

One other way, I could imagine, is a custom Map type that requires keys to implement a "Hashable" interface. Every key would be transformed to a `number` and then that number would be used as a key in an internal, regular `Map&lt;number, Value&gt;`.

Thirdly, I don't think I am the only person who would have a use for such a Map variant. Is there maybe something on npm that acts like that?

I'm learning typescript and trying to use it on a personal project.I have this function:

```
const fn = ({
   resourceId,
   select = resourceId ? state =&gt; state : id =&gt; state =&gt; state[id],
}) =&gt; {
   const selector = state =&gt;`
   resourceId ? select(resourceId(state) : select(state);)`
};
```
and I cannot make it build successfully. Here is my best attempt:

```
type Attr = string | number;
type LikeState = {
   [key: string]: any;
   [key: number]: any;
};

interface IfcFn&lt;ResourceId extends Attr | undefined&gt; {
   resourceId?: ResourceId;
   select: ResourceId extends Attr
      ? (x: Attr) =&gt; (y: LikeState) =&gt; LikeState
      : (x: LikeState) =&gt; LikeState;
}

const fn = ({
   resourceId,
   select = resourceId ? state =&gt; state : id =&gt; state =&gt; state[id],
}: IfcFn&lt;Attr | undefined&gt;) =&gt; {
   const selector = (state: LikeState) =&gt; 
      resourceId ? select(resourceId)(state) : select(state);
};
```

I know I'm not there. So, any suggestions? Thank you!
## [11][Help with handling JSON array of objects (merge two arrays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/hc5odl/help_with_handling_json_array_of_objects_merge/)

I have a json array of Objects and need to pick a corresponding object in that array according to some calculations.  

My json have a following structure: {"OD": number, "SCH" {"SCH40": number, "SCH80": number}}  

I need to do some math with OD and SCH numbers, compare it with an outside number and find corresponding value for OD key.  

I can get a new array (of numbers I compare the outside number with):  

`this.PipeareasÂ =Â this.Pipesizes.mapÂ (xÂ =&gt;Â Math.pow((x.ODÂ -Â 2Â *Â x.SCH[this.selectedSCH])/2000,2)Â *Â Math.PI);`   

How to merge existing and new arrays?  

I tried (this add extra existing array and new object to new array (not key:value pair))     

`this.PipeareasÂ =Â {...this.Pipesizes,Â Area:Â this.Pipesizes.mapÂ (xÂ =&gt;Â Math.pow((x.ODÂ -Â 2Â *Â x.SCH[this.selectedSCH])/2000,2)Â *Â Math.PI)Â }`  

and (this adds new key "Area" to each object but the value is full array, not corresponding numbers from new array)     

`this.Pipesizes.mapÂ (x =&gt; x.AreaÂ =Â this.Pipesizes.mapÂ (x =&gt; Math.pow((x.ODÂ -Â 2Â *Â x.SCH[this.selectedSCH])/2000,2)Â *Â Math.PI))`  

The result should be like:  

`return this.Pipeareas.find(x =&gt; xÂ &gt;=Â this.OutsideNumber);`
