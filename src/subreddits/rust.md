Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ioc56i/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

[https://crates.io/crates/ouroboros](https://crates.io/crates/ouroboros). Due to the `rental` crate no longer being maintained, I decided to take a stab at making a crate with similar features but with what I believe is a simpler and more flexible API.

What the title says! A month ago, I made a post asking how to get started with Rust development, whether I should prototype in Python, etc etc.

Today, I'm proud to announce that:

a. I did *not* prototype in Python, and

b. I published my first app to [crates.io](https://crates.io).

I'm really happy about this, this is my first ever big software development project (I'm 19) and the first big thing I've written in Rust. I've fallen in love with this language and I expect to be using it a lot more in the future.

What I've written is a TUI app that queries the [Discogs](https://discogs.com) database using a given username and auth token, and displays that information in a TUI. It also stores that data in an sqlite database, which means apart from querying the Discogs API, it is completely offline. The repository is [here](https://github.com/cartoon-raccoon/cogsy).

I'm still extremely new to Rust and my code will probably make you want to take a quick trip to r/eyebleach, but I'm extremely open to constructive criticism and I hope you can take the time to look through my code and give some feedback on how I can make better use of Rust's features. My code is also full of `.clone()`s and `.unwrap()`s so I could use some feedback on how to better leverage the ownership system instead of cloning everywhere.

From here, I plan to write a GraphQL web API using Rocket, mongodb and juniper, and then delve into systems programming with Rust and C. If anyone can give me advice on this path, I'd be extremely grateful.

Thanks for reading!
