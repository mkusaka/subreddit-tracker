Hi, after inspecting many languages, i found golang a language that i want to learn first, seriously, you have simple + performance in one language! But is golang simple engough for beginners? I mean i have so programing concept in my head like types, function, a little of object programing etc...

Hey all,

I've been learning Golang recently and Go Playground has been instrumental in learning it. I decided to try and make a collaborative version of it while learning Go and gRPC at the same time. Although the bulk of the project isn't really in Go (algorithm was mostly in typescript), I thought it would be more apt here since the site only runs Go code. 


Code can be found here:  [https://github.com/tankangliang/gollab](https://github.com/tankangliang/gollab) 

After completing the project, I realise a lot of the tools I've used aren't really suited for it and I guess future work will be to do a complete revamp with perhaps the following:

1) Websockets over gRPC

2) Algorithm in Go (for learning) before compiling to WASM

3) Pure Javascript for handling the frontend instead of React (issues with state)

However, school is starting soon and I probably won't have time to totally revamp it so I thought I'd share its current state here incase anyone wants to build off of it. 

Also, if you would like to read my experience on building it: [link](https://mrlobby.com/posts/building-a-collaborative-code-editor-with-react-golang-grpc/)

Hi Gophers!

The JetBrains Market Research &amp; Analytics team is currently holding interviews with Go developers that we would like you to join.

During the interview we would like to learn from your Go development experience and will talk about you, the company you work for, what kind of Go development you do, and what major pain points you have with Go, Go frameworks, and developer tools.

The interview will take no more than 1 hour and will be conducted via Google Meet.

As a thank you for devoting your time to our research, you will receive either a 1-year subscription to All Products Pack or a $100 Amazon eGift Card. Please note that these rewards assume your full participation in the study.

Here is a link to sign up to the interview: https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/Go-Developes-Interview-Sign-Up-Form

Note that the interview will be held in English.
We look forward to meeting you!

## [7][How to get the IP-address of a response that a (Tor) socks5 proxy received](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/i7pvpo/how_to_get_the_ipaddress_of_a_response_that_a_tor/)

Hello, I can route network traffic over the Tor network by using a socks5 proxy. Now I want proof that the network traffic did route over the Tor network, which I can hopefully do by matching the IP-address of the response that proxy received with the IP-address of a Tor entry node. However, when I try to get the IP-address of the response, I get the proxy's IP-address instead.

You can find the code that I have tested here [https://play.golang.org/p/Wny\_hLMA3PV](https://play.golang.org/p/Wny_hLMA3PV). However, this code does not run in the playground since it uses the libraries "github.com/cretz/bine/tor" and "github.com/ipsn/go-libtor".

I hope someone can help me to get the IP-address of a response the socks5 proxy received.

I have an app idea in mind recently, I have experience in building APIs previously using DRF(Django Rest Framework). 
Currently learning Java in my College.

I'm looking to learn Go, more specifically learning it to build a backend to do CRUD and connect it to a Flutter/React App through APIs.

After a little bit research, I've found that there are plenty frameworks in Go that can do this, which would be the most beginner friendly and easy to pick up?

Is there any equivalent for Python FastApi in Go? A minimalist web framework that automatically generates docs for the APIs that we create.
