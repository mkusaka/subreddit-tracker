I don't know if this would suit anyone but I'm just putting it out there in case it could be mutually beneficial. I am learning Ruby and getting to the stage that I could really use someone to help explain some of the slightly higher concepts. I think I would be comfortable paying USD 10/ 30 mins (min 30 mins). I am motivated and a fast learner but sometimes there's no substitute for another human to bounce things off.

Hi Ruby community!

Iâ€™m a computer science student from berlin and part of a research project where we want to understand how project management tools are used in software-development teams.  
That is why I am asking you: What are your opinions on the tools you use? Help me with my research by filling out the survey below!  
Thank you!

Hey guys,

I am getting an error in my code and I was wondering if you would be able to help. I have spent ages looking at the code and either don't understand or cant find where the error is. 

There are 3 files, they are all linked in a folder. The main file im looking at is text\_musci\_player\_w-menu.rb, the other two have data that will be used in the main file, and the other has code that helps slim it down abit.

The error im getting is:

Traceback (most recent call last):

 I'm trying to modify an excel file on my desktop using RubyXL. I'm currently running it through the Windows Linux subsystem. No matter what I seem to try I keep getting the following error

***"XLSX file format error: File C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\TestWorksheet.xlsx not found (Zip::Error)"***

This is my attempt to access the file:

***workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse("C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\TestWorksheet.xlsx")***

I have tried using escapes for the \\ as well as doubling each of them. Has anyone had this problem?

## [9][main, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR same object id?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/glj4ga/main_stdin_stdout_stderr_same_object_id/)

I've been playing around with Ruby, trying to get a better understanding of the language and I've noticed some peculiar behavior.

    puts self.object_id #=&gt; 60, no issues here, top level object id
    puts STDIN.object_id #=&gt; 60
    puts STDOUT.object_id #=&gt; 60, why would two separate constants that point to different things have the same object id?

There must be some trickery going on, are there any other ways I can prove these are different objects?

    puts self.class #=&gt; Object, as expected
    puts STDIN.class #=&gt; IO

As I poked around some more, I noticed this applies to some other predefined constants, but not to deprecated constants.

    puts ARGV.object_id #=&gt; 60
    puts ARGV.class #=&gt; Array
    puts RUBY_VERSION.object_id #=&gt; 60
    puts RUBY_VERSION.class #=&gt; String
    puts NIL.object_id #=&gt; 8

What is the reason for this behavior and how is Ruby able to assign multiple separate objects to the same object_id? Is there any official documentation that explains this? (I haven't found any.) I hope this question isn't too trivial!

One of the things I was never aware of -  **Ruby implements the push &amp; pop methods, so we can treat an array like a stack**.
