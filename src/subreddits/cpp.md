**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

## [3][static const struct to constexpr, taking the address for memcpy, too many ways to declare constants](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftwovt/static_const_struct_to_constexpr_taking_the/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftwovt/static_const_struct_to_constexpr_taking_the/

I'm updating some legacy code to C++17.  There's a header which defines test data in structs.  It uses the "static" keyword (in the C sense, outside of a class) to make the instances local to a translation unit (so that the header can be included in multiple cpp files without the linker complaining about duplicate symbol definitions).

`static const Foo foo1 { 0, 1, 0, 0 };`

`static const Foo foo2 { 2, 3, 0, 0 };`

`static const Bar bar1 { 0, 33, 0 };`

`// and so on for 2500 lines`

Since these structs are pure data, they can be constexpr.  However I'm not sure whether to declare them "`static constexpr`" or just "`constexpr`", and does it make any difference if I wrap them in an anonymous namespace or not?

This data is used as the source (but never the destination) of memcpy's.  I was surprised that the compiler did NOT complain about this when I changed the test data to constexpr.  Is this intended and safe (to take the address of a constexpr struct)?

When I tried to look this up, my search turned up questions about making sure the constexpr address is unique (aka persistent aka global) (which I don't need it to be) and things talking about declaring these as inline variables (which I don't know if I need) and a recommendation to make the constexpr a static member of a class (which I don't think I want).

If need be I can just replace all of the memcpy's with copy-assignments to render the question moot.  However it would be better if, for now, I can keep the existing memcpy'ing code as-is while using contexpr source values.  I guess I'm just looking for an explanation why it's even possible to take the address of a constexpr value &amp; assurance that's an intentional feature.

It seems C++ has accumulated so many old and new ways of declaring constant and "kind of constant" things (all with different benefits and pitfalls) that we need some kind of cheat sheet for this.  For example, "constexpr" implies "inline", but adding the word "inline" causes all the instances to share an address?  Or it causes them all to receive unique addresses?  We need a cheat sheet with a matrix of yes/no boxes.  The rows are things like "nonmember static", "static member", and columns like "weak linkage", "unique address", etc.

Most of the books I came across talks about basics of the language, even advanced topic donâ€™t seem to talk much about how to design a new project. 
What dictates what classes to use? How classes are connected to each other?

Any recommendation on how to progress on that side?

Suppose you don't have to worry about legacy code, what retroactive changes would you make to C++ to make it more readable or a better language overall syntax-wise?
## [9][Ranged-Based For-Loops and Indices](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftj56k/rangedbased_forloops_and_indices/)

Hi!

I often see sentiments akin to "raw for-loops are a code smell" when I read about Modern C++, however, as programmers we often have problem domain information that's coupled with our indices.

For certain collections, such as maps, we can iterate through every key-value pair thusly:

    std::unordered_map&lt;int,std::string&gt; m = { {1,"one"}, {2,"two"} /*...*/ };
    
    for ( auto &amp;[k,v] : m ) { ... }

But for random access collections we've only got:

    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = { 1, 2, 3, 4, /*...*/ };
    
    for ( auto &amp;e : v ) { ... }

Even though implementing it so that we could iterate over index,value pairs as well would seems fairly trivial.

As an example, I implemented this likely buggy code as a proof of concept (and lacking, as I omitted random access from the iterator as well as cbegin, cend, rbegin, rend, crbegin, and crend for the sake of brevity):

https://onlinegdb.com/r1m6_XmPI

Which allows for the following:

    // Vector&lt;T&gt; specializes std::vector&lt;T&gt;, adding context()
    Vector v = { "Never", "gonna", "give", "you", "up" };
    
    for ( auto &amp;&amp;[i,e] : v.context() )
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Element at index " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " has value: " &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; "\n";

This kind of looping seems fairly common in other languages (Lua and Python springs to mind), but C++ seems to be lacking it. Is there a particular reason for this? I'm still fairly new to C++, so perhaps there's an obvious explanation to this that eludes me... so I'd very much like to hear your thoughts on the matter. :-)

I haven't done any benchmarks of it, so I don't know how this approach compares performance-wise.

Sorry if there's any mistakes in my code or English!

Edit 2: Oh dear, I just noticed that I wrote "Ranged-Based" instead of "Range-Based" in the title... sorry!
