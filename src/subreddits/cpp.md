**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

I am very excited about static reflection proposal. I think with this proposal shoud be possible implement Dependency Injection, automatic function mapper (like in Asp.Net MVC, where you can just declare function `foo` in class, and http request with path `/foo` run this func), type mapper (there is Automapper and awesome thing like MassTransit for RabbitMQ in C#), etc.

I know that Clang already has implementation of Reflection, but not sure â€” is there up to date version of proposal?

Also, there was a proposal about custom attributes. I've used PostSharp in my job, so I am very excited to see implementation in C++ of automatic logger, maybe exception handling, caching (with Redis/KeyDB for example), etc. Is that propasal somehow implemented in clang?

What do you think? What problems can solve or what boilerplate code can remove this features in your projects? If you used any other languages, what features you wish to be implemented in C++?

After writing a few systems for games that I needed to serialize myself using RapidJSON, I wanted to know if there are any guides on "the right way" to write these functions that convert from documents to structs.

The way I usually tackle the problem is straight forward creation of values which are added to the document. This works well enough when (de)serializing 5 values and a vector, but I'd rather not redo what I did for deserializing output from a simple tile based level editor, which became a several hundred line long pyramid of doom, weakly factored into functions in the few regions I could find an appropriate place to separate the code.

I imagine it's possible to get it down to a helper function or two and a single line of code for each parameter, but I don't know the most efficient way to tackle that problem.

I know rttr is the most complete solution, but setting it up is a project in itself, and I'd like to figure out how I should be handling my serialization/deserialization for the small projects where I don't want to spend much more time on setup than what it takes to put the library in my project.

I've been asked questions before in interviews such as processes/threads/programs, virtual memory, templates, java vs c++, etc. in a couple interviews I did for SWE at these types of firms for my internship interviews the past year. I will be searching for full time roles next year and would like to be better prepared for these types of questions. What sort of things should I know/understand in terms of C++/systems/design knowledge?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fu8nuc/vector_transform_constructor/
---
Wouldn't it be nice to add a constructor to the vector class that takes a pair of iterators or a range and applies a transformation to the elements before their inserted? For example:

```
template&lt;class InputIt, class UnaryOperation&gt;
vector(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryOperation unary_op);
```

This would greatly simplify and be essentially equivalent to

```
std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec;
vec.reserve(other_vec.size());
std::transform(other_vec.begin(), other_vec.end(),
               std::back_inserter(vec), unary_func);

// becomes
std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec(other_vec.begin(), other_vec.end(), unary_func);
```

Is this a decent idea? I've been meaning to try to get involved in the standardization process in some way and submitting a paper for this would be a good place to start if the idea makes sense.
## [11][Error Checks + Inconsistent Boolean Conversion = ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fuaafj/error_checks_inconsistent_boolean_conversion/)

Working with a code base that internally often returns `optional&lt;&gt;` and also `error_code`. There is also an `expect&lt;&gt;` type mixed in.

With `optional&lt;&gt;` or `expect&lt;&gt;` you check `if(!ret)` for error, but if an `error_code` is returned you check `if(ret)`. Easy?

I've never really been confronted with the immediate problem that kind of dimorphic error tests cause until there was a bug. God damn it! That's no fun when you have to deep dive into a mess of functions with lots of those nasty `if(!ret)` just to find out that one `if(!ret)` in a very rarely executed path that escaped the unit tests should have actually been an `if(ret)`. I cannot even blame the author, humans are just not meant to get this right consistently. But when the compiler cannot detect such errors (since the code is obviously well formed) I get scared. Like raw pointer magic scared - you never know when things are going to blow up. It might be a very good idea to consistently use something like `if(has_error(ret))` and overload that `has_error(...)` for `error_code` and `optional&lt;&gt;` and `expect&lt;&gt;` \- thus ditching the boolean conversions like plain new and delete and raw pointers in the hope to maybe produce less broken code.

In my humble and useless opinion error\_code should convert to boolean true if no error just for consistency or don't provide a boolean conversion at all. But that train has long left the station.

## [12][static const struct to constexpr, taking the address for memcpy, too many ways to declare constants](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftwovt/static_const_struct_to_constexpr_taking_the/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftwovt/static_const_struct_to_constexpr_taking_the/
---
I'm updating some legacy code to C++17.  There's a header which defines test data in structs.  It uses the "static" keyword (in the C sense, outside of a class) to make the instances local to a translation unit (so that the header can be included in multiple cpp files without the linker complaining about duplicate symbol definitions).

`static const Foo foo1 { 0, 1, 0, 0 };`

`static const Foo foo2 { 2, 3, 0, 0 };`

`static const Bar bar1 { 0, 33, 0 };`

`// and so on for 2500 lines`

Since these structs are pure data, they can be constexpr.  However I'm not sure whether to declare them "`static constexpr`" or just "`constexpr`", and does it make any difference if I wrap them in an anonymous namespace or not?

This data is used as the source (but never the destination) of memcpy's.  I was surprised that the compiler did NOT complain about this when I changed the test data to constexpr.  Is this intended and safe (to take the address of a constexpr struct)?

When I tried to look this up, my search turned up questions about making sure the constexpr address is unique (aka persistent aka global) (which I don't need it to be) and things talking about declaring these as inline variables (which I don't know if I need) and a recommendation to make the constexpr a static member of a class (which I don't think I want).

If need be I can just replace all of the memcpy's with copy-assignments to render the question moot.  However it would be better if, for now, I can keep the existing memcpy'ing code as-is while using contexpr source values.  I guess I'm just looking for an explanation why it's even possible to take the address of a constexpr value &amp; assurance that's an intentional feature.

It seems C++ has accumulated so many old and new ways of declaring constant and "kind of constant" things (all with different benefits and pitfalls) that we need some kind of cheat sheet for this.  For example, "constexpr" implies "inline", but adding the word "inline" causes all the instances to share an address?  Or it causes them all to receive unique addresses?  We need a cheat sheet with a matrix of yes/no boxes.  The rows are things like "nonmember static", "static member", and columns like "weak linkage", "unique address", etc.
