This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

To all those MoPub users, how much actually is the minimum CPM that you put on the marketplace for:

Banners

Interstitial

Rewarded video

That gets you the best fill rate ?

Are you using mediation and which one ?

Hi developer friends,

I'm currently developing an app and I'm a bit stuck. I'm absolutely non familiar with this thing called "asking for help" but, it will save me a real deal of time (&gt;10y developing and it's the first or second time I ask smth).

So, please help me reddit \\o/

&amp;#x200B;

In Java, I have four data streams, all in real time and all can be interrupted and resumed. Two are audio and two video. I need to record them in a single file.

Example :

https://preview.redd.it/kythxgvd7y841.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748f2e3fd82cad2459686e0cd4f9bf4ca3ebb80a

I could use the mp4  multitrack solution proposed in the native muxer doc (even if the android +26 is a big penalty) but I don't know if it supports a stream to be interrupted in the middle while "preserving the absence of data".

&amp;#x200B;

Is there an existing way to do it ? I prefer to avoid creating my own.

How's the future of AR looking for android? Is it worth investing time into early on?
