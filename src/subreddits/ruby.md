Hello everyone

It's a refactoring video with tips to make our code more maintainable. The codebase is Rails, still most tips are very relevant to all Rubyist.

Last year I presented a refactoring at Tokyo Rubyist Meetup. On stage I only used slides, for the video I wanted to do a live coding which I think is more appropriate for an online video.

That was my first presentation and it's my first video! üéâ

Feedback are welcome. Prononciation is a struggle (in any language), I'm working on it, hope it's ok enough.

Here is the link, Id love to know - how I can improve myself.  


UPD: The task was simple - create API for product with tags (there are was few requests in postman file)  
The condition also was - it will be work with ember on front-end, so I have some formats restricted.

I'm wondering if this problem has been solved before, and if it has, if it's open source.

I need to generate a grid (lets say 1000x1000). I need to be able to plot things on it (such as chairs, desks, and blocked out areas).

I could see something like:

    grid = Grid.new(1000,1000);
    Grid.plot(chair, 500, 200);
    Grid.generate();

This is for a ruby app so thought I'd ask about it in Ruby but perhaps it's just easier to generate these statically using an image program.

Thanks for any advice!
## [9][Strings -- how does `\b` work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/hee8tu/strings_how_does_b_work/)

source:

`s = "string"`

`s.size.times { |index| print(s[index]); sleep(0.01) }`  
`s.size.times { print("\b") }`

and this is ok, but if I replace the first `print()` with `puts()`, I get `s` printed out vertically and nothing deleted.  
basically, "\\b" can't delete new lines, is there a specific format character for doing that?
