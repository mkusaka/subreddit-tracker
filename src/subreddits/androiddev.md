Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I have this app of a client which acts as the Home Screen Launcher. That is, on the device's home screen, on swipeRight, it opens up. Same as how we have Google News on Pixel phones and Bixby on Samsung phones.  


My question here is, when I was trying to fix something I came to know that this app should be used as,

    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME" /&gt;

Instead of,

    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;

Could anyone tell me what would be the major difference between these two categories and when I should be using both?  


P.S - Appls like Nova Launcher falls under which category - HOME or LAUNCHER?

P.P.S - If the intended action is as same as Google News on Pixel devices, what do you recommend to use?

I am getting like 20 lines a second of output that look just like:

&amp;#x200B;

2020-10-23 01:01:37.216 7429-8654/com.example.\[APP\_NAME\] D/eglCodecCommon: setVertexArrayObject: set vao to 254 (254) 46 655

&amp;#x200B;

But with different numbers each line. It's totally preventing me from being able to check on my log output. I have no idea where it could be coming from. My hunch is that it has to do with Mapbox. Any thoughts?
