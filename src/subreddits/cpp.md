**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

I tend to prefer using braces. From effective C++ :

&gt;Braced initialization is the most widely usable initialization syntax, it prevents  
&gt;  
&gt;narrowing conversions, and itâ€™s immune to C++â€™s most vexing parse.

But there is the infamous subtlety of std::initializer\_list :

&gt;During constructor overload resolution, braced initializers are matched to  
&gt;  
&gt;std::initializer\_list parameters if at all possible, even if other constructors  
&gt;  
&gt;offer seemingly better matches.

The book has this example :

    Widget w4({}); // calls std::initializer_list ctor
                   // with empty list
    Widget w5{{}}; // ditto

Here goes the question :

why was it decided to have

    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec{1, 2, 3};

interpreted as an initialization with an initializer\_list when the empty list initialization above suggest it could be (and in fact can be) done with :

    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec{{1, 2, 3}};

?

Would it just move the problem a little farther by shadowing single argument constructors ?

Am I missing the point completely ?

Godbolt to play with : [https://godbolt.org/z/mCnJdz](https://godbolt.org/z/mCnJdz)

Sorry if it is a recurring (or straightforward) question, it does not seem straightforward to me yet. I just find it odd to have this arguably annoying behavior when there seems to be a way to construct an object with an initializer\_list without (?) the downside mentioned above.

Cheers

During the development of [toml++](https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/) I've been forced to contend with Unicode. Not knowing much about Unicode before this project, combined with C++'s, er, _varied_ text handling utilities, has meant it's been quite an education.  

One of the challenges I needed to solve was being able to quickly determine if a code point belongs to one of a set of 'categories' so I could answer questions like "is this a letter?" in a unicode-aware way. Turns out that while the amount of meaningful unicode code points is relatively small (100,000-ish), they're very sparsely and unevenly distributed over a much larger range. Typically I'd use a lookup table for this sort of thing but since the data is so sparse it would be horrendously wasteful, so I figured some sort of static binary search tree solution would be a good way to go.  

The solution I ultimately went with was to write a [python script](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus/blob/master/python/generate_unicode_functions.py) that downloads the unicode database and uses it to generate C++ functions by iteratively:
- Reducing a codepoint range to a single expression if possible (relops, bitmask, modulo, etc), or
- Reducing a codepoint range to a local not-too-large-or-sparse bitmask lookup table if possible, or
- Emitting a switch statement consisting of a small number of the above, or
- Subdividing the range into smaller ranges and trying again.

The output looks [like this](https://godbolt.org/z/PFqsWB). That function is for identifying 'combining marks'; codepoints from the Mn and Mc categories. There's only about 2000 of those but they're spread out over a range of around 900,000. You can see the assembly is pretty lean, with it mostly just being about the bitmask lookup tables (earlier versions of the algorithm sans-bitmask lookup tables generated about 4x more assembly, [like this example](https://godbolt.org/z/SGfczK)).  

This post is partly about "hey I did a fun weird thing involving C++", but also partly inquisitive: is this an insane way of solving this problem? Is there something fundamentally obvious I'm missing?

I'm trying to setup `experimental::executor` preferably with clang-10 but two of the implementations ([this](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/executors) and [that](https://github.com/executors/executors-impl)) that I've tried, failed to build. The first implementation doesn't even offer CMake support, and is incompatible with current latest implementation of `std::future`.

Is there an available implementation which builds with clang-9 or clang-10? If not, then what's the best way to go about compiling and successful running a basic example of `experimental::executor`?
## [11][Padding in structs and classes with exactly one member](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g437oc/padding_in_structs_and_classes_with_exactly_one/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g437oc/padding_in_structs_and_classes_with_exactly_one/
---
I am wondering if there is any situation in which a struct or class with one member would have a different size (using sizeof()) than the size of its member, assuming that the struct is not inheriting from any other class. Is this undefined behavior, or is it something that the standard guarantees to be true?

On a second note, I am also wondering if there is a portable way to determine at compile-time whether or not a struct has a single member or not, given that I know the name of that member and its size. Thanks for your help.
