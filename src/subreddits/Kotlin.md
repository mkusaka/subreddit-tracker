Hi everyone, I tried Ktor with my pet project and it was a pretty interesting experience. It was something new after 3 years of using spring, my questions are:
1) Is it anyone who using ktor in production, and what is your opinion?
2) How to persuade the management(CTO, team leads) to start using Ktor?

Hey guys 

I am Starting soon a new job with Kotlin as server side technology with Spring boot.

I was wondering if there are out there "reference books" like we had with Java, " Effective Java"

I checked on amazon there is Head First Kotlin..that would be my first choice for now..but I am open to hear other suggestions from you..either books or video tutorials..

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks !

I want to start developing Android apps so I download Android Studio and saw there were 2 language options, Java and Kotlin.

I know that Kotlin is new and Google announced that it's their favorite. But do you guys think it will eventually become the mainstream language for developing Android apps?

Also, can anyone give me examples of apps that use Kotlin and if someone can recommend a book or a website for beginners?
