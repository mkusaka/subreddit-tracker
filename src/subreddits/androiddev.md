This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hi guys. I'm an editor at Android Police. I'm working on a story regarding background app issues on OnePlus devices, and I'm looking for some anecdotes and technical details from developers that may have run into issues with the overly aggressive background app management present on OnePlus phones.

Anecdotally, I think even some consumers know know it's an issue on OnePlus devices because of things like delayed notifications, but I've spoken to a handful of app developers that claim Oxygen OS's aggressive background app management doesn't just result in issues with their apps working correctly (as they do on other Android devices), but also extra support overhead: A disproportionately larger number of support tickets come from customers with OnePlus phones.

OnePlus [previously said they'd do something to fix aggressive background app killing](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/10/oneplus-promises-to-stop-killing-apps-in-the-background/), but according to the developers I have already spoken to, our own experiences at Android Police with delayed notifications on OnePlus devices, and our tests with [the new DontKillMyApp benchmark](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/07/02/dontkillmyapp-is-a-new-benchmark-for-how-aggressively-your-phone-kills-background-apps/), they either haven't addressed the issue, or they've done too little to fix it.

I am currently in contact with the company trying to get that to change, and I'm working on a story regarding the issue to increase that pressure. This post has been approved by the /r/androiddev mods, and I'd really like to hear any issues you may have run into as a developer when it comes to this problem.

Feel free to reach out to me either here via PM or through [any of my listed contact details](https://www.androidpolice.com/author/ryne-hager/) including email at our site.

I am developing for Android with Unity and would like to test the Google Play Service integration. It seems that uploading for internal test via the play console is taking some time, I was wondering if anyone has any good experience with an emulator to quickly test a build?

Thanks

I'm trying to integrate Amazon Pay into my app.

https://developer.amazon.com/docs/eu/amazon-pay-onetime/amazon-pay-and-login-with-amazon-introduction.html

However it says:

Note: The Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon services have been designed and developed for use within a web browser only. Our services cannot be used within a native application (including, without limitation, iOS, Android, RIM, and Windows operating systems). Amazon Pay reserves the right to suspend the payment account of any user of our services that has implemented our service within a native application.

Not sure what this means, because they have a Java SDK

https://github.com/amzn/amazon-pay-sdk-java

would that not work with Android?
