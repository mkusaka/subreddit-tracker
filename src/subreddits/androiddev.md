Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

Google restricting the apps [that access SMS, Call Logs](https://medium.com/@benabrin/no-more-sms-call-log-permissions-for-digital-lenders-and-financial-inclusion-android-apps-now-280bea00df06) permission groups from the users and 80 percent rejection rate for applications?
## [10][RecyclerView](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hx1hnd/recyclerview/)

This might probably not be the most interesting post, but I have been working on my first android application and its almost done except the RecyclerView. 
I have tried to follow multiple tutorials -CodingWithMitch, stack overflow answers, developer docs, and even GitHub APIs, but somehow I am always running into an error. 
My need for a RecyclerView is very simple. A simple card view and text. That's it. 
Could anyone be nice enough to point me in the direction to a correct working link or perhaps give some insight into any alternatives on GitHub or something like that? 

Thanks. 

Best,
A budding android developer.
