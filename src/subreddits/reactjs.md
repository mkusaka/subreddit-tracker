We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey I'm trying to render a table inside of a &lt;TabPanel&gt; &lt;/ TabPanel&gt; and I'm getting an error because the table is rendering inside of a &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is there any ways to force the TabPanel to render as a &lt;div&gt;? Thanks!

I believe that one of the best ways to use twitter is by browsing its trending topics, so I made an app showing them directly.

We are a group of two Canadian developers who are new to front end development, so we decided to learn ReactJS and ended up building a cute Animal Crossing Tool Web App :) ([https://acislove.com/](https://acislove.com/))

We spent total of 2 weeks to build it from scratch and it was a blast \^\_\^

Feel free to ask us any questions with ! We would love to hear about your feedback as well.
## [10][Change an element when it leaves the viewport - A question on How.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gl76kq/change_an_element_when_it_leaves_the_viewport_a/)

      const [scroll, setScroll] = useState(false)
    
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        window.addEventListener("scroll", () =&gt; {
          window.scrollY &gt; 5 ? setScroll(!scroll) : setScroll(!scroll)
        })
        return () =&gt; {
          setScroll(false)
        }
      }, [scroll])
    

So I have the used the above code to create a Header/Navigation to change on scroll, but this doesn't do what I want. I have a select element with 2 buttons under it. When this select element and buttons leave the viewport, I want to create a FAB for navigation, but I'm sort of stuck.

Before I go forward: The code above doesn't work because I have a scroll event attached to the container the select element is in (it's needed because of layout and spacing)

I'm not really sure how to move forward here, I've come across several code snippets similar to what I gave above, and none work. I *thought* I'd be able to use intersection observer, but I don't have enough information about or on it to move forward without a working example.

Could someone possible help me out or point me in the right direction?

Something I pulled together quickly after getting frustrated having to navigate multiple pages + dropdowns and losing history if closing the wrong tab on a certain website.

Turns out this took is actually much faster and I might continue working on it.

If anyone here is interested once it's a bit more polished I might write up a tutorial since it was surprisingly easier than expected. This was my first time using Next.js and the heroku service.
