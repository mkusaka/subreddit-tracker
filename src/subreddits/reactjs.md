Note: Select "javascript" in the skills filter to view all the javascript jobs

âœ… 100% remote full-time jobs.    
âœ… Each and every job is manually curated and verified. Spent more than 14 hours for this.

## [11][Best way to render data to client from server by visiting url with Apollo Client / GraphQL](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jabsu1/best_way_to_render_data_to_client_from_server_by/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jabsu1/best_way_to_render_data_to_client_from_server_by/

So I'm currently integrating the Stripe API with my app and I have reached the stage where I need to [Create a SetupIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-and-reuse#web-create-setup-intent) which returns a `client_id` object from the server to the client.

Since I'm using NextJS w/ Apollo Client which (query and mutation resolvers) alongside GraphQL, I don't believe the example on the Stripe docs applies in my case. Maybe someone could explain why, but for example, the sample code they give is this:

    app.engine('.hbs', expressHandlebars({ extname: '.hbs' }));
    app.set('view engine', '.hbs');
    app.set('views', './views');
    
    app.get('/card-wallet', async (req, res) =&gt; {
      const intent =  await stripe.setupIntents.create({
        customer: customer.id,
      });
      res.render('card_wallet', { client_secret: intent.client_secret });
    });
    
    app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {
      console.log('Running on port 3000');
    });

And we're particularly interested in this part, since the templating engine does not apply in my case:

    app.get('/card-wallet', async (req, res) =&gt; {
      const intent =  await stripe.setupIntents.create({
        customer: customer.id,
      });
      res.render('card_wallet', { client_secret: intent.client_secret });
    });

How would I implement this with Queries / Mutations? Is it even possible to implement this with an Apollo Client set up?

hey guys I have a &lt;NoteList /&gt; component that renders the list of my notes from the store. I want to maintain a search input that can filter the existing data in the store based on the search input. I read some articles on defining action filters but none of them made sense to me, can you guys help?
