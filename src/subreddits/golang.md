I've started this project to learn GO and to learn how web browsers work.

This is the project link:

[https://github.com/danfragoso/thdwb](https://github.com/danfragoso/thdwb)

I tried to not use any dependency on this project, and write everything myself.

I wrote the following components:

* ketchup (html parser and DOM Tree builder)
* mayo (css parser and Render Tree builder)
* mustard (UI Toolkit, events and OpenGL)
* sauce (requests, cache and filesystem)
* bun (css layout calculator)

The dependencies are:

* [https://github.com/fogleman/gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) (fork)
* [https://github.com/go-gl/gl](https://github.com/go-gl/gl)
* [https://github.com/go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw)

It builds and runs on Linux and macOS.

It's is for the most part completely broken. But I would love any kind of feedback and suggestions on the features I should work next.

I was struggling with how slow my laptop gets when I run Docker with a lot of microservices, so I built a Docker Compose alternative that runs in the cloud rather than on my local machine. It's called Blimp: [https://kelda.io/blimp/](https://kelda.io/blimp/)

* Written entirely in Go: we took advantage of the recently released [Go Docker-Compose spec](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go)
* Runs on Kubernetes under the hood. I thought we could just use Kompose, but ends up thereâ€™s tons of subtle differences between Kube and Docker Compose that aren't captured in the yaml
* We use an encrypted GRPC tunnel to forward localhost to the cloud environment. It was important to us that it *just worked* without having to change the workflow at all.
* For most volumes, we just use standard Kube volumes. But for bind mounts [we automatically use Syncthing](https://kelda.io/blimp/docs/compose-diff/#syncthing). Traditional volume mounts don't perform well over the WAN, and aren't necessary anyways.

Would love feedback, what do you think??

## [9][Connecting ZMQ microservices within AWS using Fargate](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/gcnn6d/connecting_zmq_microservices_within_aws_using/)

I am attempting to use ZeroMQ ([https://github.com/pebbe/zmq4](https://github.com/pebbe/zmq4)) within ECS running on Fargate in awsvpc mode. I have 2 different services, each running its own task and service discovery enabled.

I create my Router and Dealer in a microservice called broker.

        front, _ := zmq.NewSocket(zmq.ROUTER)
        defer front.Close()
        front.Bind("tcp://*:4070")
        
        back, _ := zmq.NewSocket(zmq.DEALER)
        defer back.Close()
        back.Bind("tcp://*:4080")

I then add these 2 sockets to a poller and have a for loop that waits for messages. 

I have a separate microservice that connects to the socket and attempts to send a message to the dealer. I have set service discovery so I assume the address I connect to would be: 

&amp;#x200B;

    &gt; "tcp://broker:4070"
    
    Below is the code from 'serviceA'
    
        func New(ZMQ models.ZMQ) *Requester {
        	s, err := zmq.NewSocket(zmq.REQ)
        	if err != nil {
        		log.Fatalln("shareholder/requester zmq.NewSocket", err)
        	}
        	p := zmq.NewPoller()
        	p.Add(s, zmq.POLLIN)
        
        	log.Println("Requester", ZMQ.Req)
        	err = s.Connect("tcp://broker:4070")
        	if err != nil {
        		log.Print(fmt.Errorf("err is %w", err))
        	}
        
        	req := &amp;Requester{
        		Poller:  p,
        		Retries: 2,
        		Socket:  s,
        		Timeout: time.Duration(time.Minute),
        	}
        	runtime.SetFinalizer(req, (*Requester).Close)
        	return req
        }

I then use the above code to send a message with my socket connection

        _, err := r.Socket.SendMessage(req)

However, my message is never received within my broker service. I can hit my REST APIs on the network with their hostnames I register during service discovery, is there something I am missing here with Fargate/ECS/ZeroMQ???

Hi. I have made a small repository with a bunch of code sample showcasing Go. Personally sometimes when I want to learn something new, I just want to see a bunch of code samples and compare them to what I already know, from other languages I have mastered. The link is right here: [https://github.com/TopSwagCode/Go.CheatRepo](https://github.com/TopSwagCode/Go.CheatRepo) 

I would love all the feedback that I can get. I am totally new to Go myself and just wanted to make this CheatRepo public, so others also could benefit it. I already have a Roadmap with some ideas to grow the repository with more content.
