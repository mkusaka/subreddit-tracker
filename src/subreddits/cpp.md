Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I released `mgs`, a C++14 codec library (which for now only includes base64/32/16).

Heavily inspired by [cppcodec](https://github.com/tplgy/cppcodec), its goal is to provide a simple and generic API, by emulating C++20 concepts, to encode/decode from/to user-defined types.

GitHub repo: [https://github.com/theodelrieu/mgs](https://github.com/theodelrieu/mgs)

Documentation: [https://theodelrieu.github.io/mgs-docs/index.html](https://theodelrieu.github.io/mgs-docs/index.html)

Let me know what you think!

## [7][Realiable / clear compiler (C++20) feature implementation status?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ijmwoo/realiable_clear_compiler_c20_feature/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ijmwoo/realiable_clear_compiler_c20_feature/

I am really eager to use some big C++20 features like concepts, ranges and compilers seem to have implementations for it already. I use gcc and as far as I can tell everything is still "experimental", but I am a bit frustrated about finding a reliable "status" on implemented features.

E.g. [at cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20) many features are simply listed as implemented in gcc 10 .. which seems to be not really true, or at least the [gcc manual](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.2.0/gcc.pdf) says "support is highly experimental" for the '-std=c++20' flag, which at least to me does not mean fully implemented at all ... e.g. would you use this in production? I suppose not?

But even in the gcc manual not only do I find it a bit sneaky to put experimental features as '-std=c++20' which is a very .. non-experimental-looking .. option, but it also feels very handwavy. What feature exactly is experimental? Everything? E.g. under the option '-fconcepts' it simply says c++2a turns concepts on, but nothing about that feature being experimental ... so which is it?

  
Is there any resource that has a more clear list of (fully/final) feature implementations?

## [9][Question regarding optional virtual destructor in C++20](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ijbaf5/question_regarding_optional_virtual_destructor_in/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ijbaf5/question_regarding_optional_virtual_destructor_in/

Given

    template&lt;typename T, bool needVirtual&gt;
    struct C
    {
        virtual ~C() requires(needVirtual)
        {}
    
        ~C() = default;
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        C&lt;int, false&gt; c1;
        C&lt;int, true&gt; c2;
    
        return 0;
    }

([https://godbolt.org/z/oa4vjc](https://godbolt.org/z/oa4vjc))

I would expect `c1` to not have virtual destructor and, well, to not be a virtual class.

Currently however **gcc** does create a virtual class:

    vtable for C&lt;int, false&gt;:
            .quad   0
            .quad   0

And **clang** seems to fail to compile:

    error: virtual function cannot have a requires clause

What is the correct behavior according to the standard?    
Thank you!    
P.S. I know one can have the desired behavior with conditional base classes.

I'm interested to know which IDE everyone else uses. Thanks for reading this and have a wonderful day.

Edit: There's no Visual Studio because I got confused with Visual Studio Code. Sorry everyone, my bad.
