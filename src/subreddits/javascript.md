**1)** What excite you the most about Javascript future ? new frameworks ? new syntax or javascript version ? new ide / tools ? What would you change about Javascript that we don't have now... how you would do things differently ?

**2)** Do you believe that Javascript is taking some work and responsibilities out of the Java or C# programmer or both will always have their place a backend language and JS as the main frontend ui language ? Talked with some C# JAVA dev and they say node / javascript isn't great for large enterprise project and they are excited about Web Assembly and Blazor what do you think of that ?
