Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

From Hans Wennborgs email:

&gt; Some highlights include:

&gt; - C++ Concepts support in Clang

&gt; - Clang no longer runs in a separate process by default ("in-process cc1")

&gt; - Windows control flow guard (CFG) checks

&gt; - Support for more processor cores and features

I've read P0315R4, but I'm still not sure whether decltype of a lambda should yield different types in multiple instantiations when used as a default template argument. If it does, would that mean that this [is_complete type trait](https://godbolt.org/z/CO9CA6) is valid C++20 and actually works?

Every once in a while you find yourself with multiple vectors that represent something like different columns of the same data set:  the vectors will be of the same length, and elements at common indexes are related.  This is mostly no big deal until you want to do something fun like sort based on one of them.  I was thinking to myself how the algorithms  would work fine if I could have an iterator that iterates all n vectors at once.  Basically, have a tuple of iterators, and have that tuple itself satisfy the iterator interface by forwarding the calls to each of the elements of the tuple.  

&amp;#x200B;

I assume this isn't a wholly original idea, is there one out there written already?  Are there better solutions, other than the obvious refactoring of it into a vector of tuples/objects/structs/etc? Isn't there some trick like using an algorithm to get an ordering from the sort order vector, and using that ordering to sort the others?

## [12][Why is string to string_view an operator of string and not a constructor of string_view?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fo6o78/why_is_string_to_string_view_an_operator_of/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fo6o78/why_is_string_to_string_view_an_operator_of/

So I'm coming from a four-hour debugging ordeal which basically boiled down to a code line like this:

    // std::string *str; 
    std::string_view view(str == nullptr ? "" : *str);

The problem was that this creates a temporary string as result of the ternary operator, since `""` is implicitly converted to `string` and that is not an lvalue. So the `string_view` is created from a temporary `string` object. However, since the temporary object goes out of scope immediately after the constructor call, `view` points to free'd memory (and, in the future, to garbage).

If the conversion from `string` to `string_view` would have instead been defined as single-argument constructor of `string_view` taking a `const std::string&amp;`, my code would not have compiled. So, why is it defined as operator? Doesn't that just invite bugs like this?
