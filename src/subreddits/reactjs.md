It‚Äôs more noticeable when I‚Äôm in files longer than 100 lines but that‚Äôs pretty damn common. Usually takes VS Code between 10-15 seconds to complete the Intellisense check. Any fixes?

I'm using TailwindCSS in this particular project. To organize my classes, I use template literals in the classNames tag and logically split up CSS properties on each line. It looks fine in VSCode ([https://imgur.com/a/y8e1nFj](https://imgur.com/a/y8e1nFj)), but when I commit to my code to Github the indentation gets messed up badly ([https://imgur.com/a/8mUwn6U](https://imgur.com/a/8mUwn6U)).

I've been pulling my hair out trying to solve this issue. Please help me out. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

 On this episode we‚Äôll chat with Ram ([@nparashuram](https://twitter.com/nparashuram)) and team from Facebook. Ram is an engineering manager on Oculus, where he works on the React Native companion app, and on the headset itself, using React VR.

As part of that work, Ram gets to play with [Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes), the JavaScript engine designed to help React Native apps start up fast. We plan on asking Parashuram important questions, like ‚ÄúIs working on VR as awesome as it sounds?‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúHow can I be cool like you when I grow up?‚Äù We‚Äôll probably ask questions about Hermes too.

(I know this kind of question is asked frequently, so I apologize for potentially asking something redundant. It's just that everything seems to change so quickly, and I realize even resources from six months ago could be stale. I really don't know what I'm doing when it comes to translating a React app to desktop, so I figured the best thing to do was ask people with more experience.)

Anyway, I ran into a problem with a project yesterday and realized I'm not going to be able to run it as a browser app. This is because I need to use certain reserved keyboard shortcuts, and there's no way to prevent the browser from responding to them.

I was going to just make the app normally then bring Electron in. Is that going to work? Or is there something else I should use? Would I have significant difficulties modifying it for desktop, or can I just carry on and plan to move forward as a regular React app for now?
