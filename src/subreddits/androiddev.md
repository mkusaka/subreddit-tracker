This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Every morning when I wake up I check my phone. I am always a little bit anxious of seeing this little icon from the google console in my notification bar. Usually not good news.   
This morning I saw that icon and almost got a heart attack when I read the notification:  
all my apps removed because of violation of the developer content policy. They did not send me an email at all. What the hell, this cannot be true. Not again please!    
Immediately contacted my account manager at Google admob. Asked him if he could forward my issue directly to the playstore team.  
And of course i quickly went over all my apps. Checking for missing things like app ratings etc. Found an email from last year from the Google Playstore saying: \[Action Required\] Switch to the Play Referrer API by March 1, 2020. I remember that the issue was actually in one of the firebase libs which were not fixed even a month ago. Could it be that? Lets update the libs first. I also noticed that inside the user aqcuisition section of my apps there was a warning about some kind of expired payment method. Weird, because I am not using that functionality. Checked [google.ads](https://google.ads) and found out that my creditcard was expired. Updated it immediately.

I filed quickly a new update of all the apps without testing them. Published it and 2 hours laters i got a notification again that my apps are back live! Amazing. My entire morning's mood changed from a hopeless , feared and angered person to the happiest man on earth.   


Nevertheless i find it still unacceptable that these kind of things are possible. I still don't know what the real issue was. My apps are having about 5m daily users and are for a large part generating income for my company. App business remains a still risky one!

I have written and published a few apps. I get the to the point of working then publish them, then see how they do and what their pick-up is. A couple of them are doing better than the others. At what point would you start work on the next, prettier version?

I have an old(er) PC and Ubuntu installed because it ran faster than Windows that was previously on it. It has 6GB  RAM and I know that android studio uses at least 8GB to function normally, but that's the best I got for now. It literally takes 10+ minutes for emulator to just turn on. The feeling reminds me of the old days when the internet was slow AF. Is there anything I can do?

Even with 100% Kotlin source code, will some of the generated files (Navigation, ViewBinding, R class, etc) prevent compilation to be purely kotlinc?

Hi Android Developers, I have been developing android apps for 4 years now and I am well versed with android but this is my first time with android camera2 api. I am well aware that it is a pain to work with camera in android, so can you tell me and other first time Camera app developers what are the common pitfalls and advice that one needs to be aware about.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I just checked CameraX turned Beta Last Week (Good News)

I'm a mid experienced Android developer and lately, I found difficult to correctly use all the "good" stuff that the Android team pushed in the last 2 years, in particular:

  
\- Architecture Componentes and the MVP logic  
\- Coroutines  
\- Data Binding

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to join a course on these topics but literally I couldn't find one that is 100% up-to-date with the latest stuff of end 2019.

Paid courses are welcome, even on-site one (London).

Do you have any suggestion for these topics?

Thank you very much.
