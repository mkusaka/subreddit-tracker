This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I am trying to make a text editor app. It is a simple app with just an EditText (optionally TextView for read-only purpose) and a few buttons. Everything is fine, except that when the user tries to open a very long text file, the EditText or TextView widget hangs for some time.

I have seen many text editors which can handle really long texts. How do they achieve that?

I have been a software engineer for about 10 years now but mostly web application developer (full stack) I changed gears into full time Android development within my current company (in a different team) about 2 years ago and considering a job switch. 

Since I never interviewed for Android position directly, I am not sure what to expect in the interview.

Can someone shed some light, what to expect?

Thanks in advance!

Hii guys, I was wondering if there's a reliable android automated testing tools like firebase robo test (tried this it has some issues). Also it would be great help if you guys redirect to some great testing script tutorials for Android. Seems like there's little emphasis on automated testing on Android!

Hello. I've recently published my app and i would like to generate some interest and initial users by handing out promo codes that allow the redeemer to get the app for free. In the Play Console i can only find an option to create a promotion with a finite amount of one-time-use codes. I can hand these out manually to my friends, but if i wanted to create, for example, a post on Facebook saying you can get it for free while codes are available seems like a clunky way to do it by sending each person a message with their unique code. 

Play Store documentation says something about custom codes but i cannot find that option.

Is there maybe a third party service that can hand out one of my provided codes per IP/click?

Edit: my google search was too general i guess. If you look for services that distribute play store codes specifically you get decent third party options.

Thanks in advance.
