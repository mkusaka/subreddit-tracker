Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Do you have any experience with them? I am looking for a serious ad network for mediation but for some reason they seem shady, and something about them just doesn't feel right. From their policy to how they collect and manage user data.  


Have you worked with MoPub? What are your thoughts on MoPub?

Hi there,  I'm the developer of a booking app call TripU. We just started to run user acquisition campaigns and racked up millions of downloads in five-month. However, through Google Console, I found some risk statics that the number of active users is to low compared to new acquisition users. For example, I started on Monday and have 1000 active users, on Tuesday I get 1000 new user acquisitions but new number of active users just be 1200. Assume our retention = 0, so at least I must have \~ 2000 active users huh?

Active users in GG console mean ***"The number of users who have your app installed on at least one device that was active in the preceding 30 days"*** so I wonder that how can someone install my app without opening their device? It could there are some IDs installed my app on multiple devices. But it can't be too much like that.

 So my question is: did you ever see a similar trend for one of your apps? So many thanks, guys.

First off, thanks for the help in advance, and I know this has probably been asked a 1000 times in different ways and I have looked at some of the other posts including this one ([https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/dqv8s6/learning\_android\_dev/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/dqv8s6/learning_android_dev/)), but I don't know enough to know what I don't know, lol.  So I thought I ask you all for help.

I'm an experienced web dev and aws solutions architect but my only mobile exposure has been through pwas and a bit of React Native play.  I have a few ideas I'd like to try to build and so I thought  I'd try to learn some Android development.  

I have a million questions, but I thought I'd just start by asking if I should learn Kotlin (or java?) first and then dive into Android, or can I combine my language learning while diving into Android.  I don't need an intro to coding or OO &amp; functional techniques but have never worked in Kotlin (or java), so any recommendations on a learning path and resources would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again,

[EncryptedSharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences)

What are some practical use-cases for EncryptedSharedPreferences? I originally wanted to use it to store some user credit card information, but there aren't many discussions surrounding if/why this is a good/bad idea.

Hi all, I am building an application for a research project, and I want to know if it is possible to keep track of which applications were used during each session. A session is defined as the time between screen unlock and lock.

I know about the [UsageStatsManager api](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageStatsManager) but to my understanding it would not be able to show me data for intervals smaller than a day. I am trying to use native android apis as much as possible and to avoid 3rd party libraries, but if this can be solved with 3rd party libraries I would consider it. Maybe I'm completely misunderstanding how it works, as I've been looking at this for a couple of hours now.

Another thing, if anyone knows, but does UsageStatsManager update the usage data right away, or is there a delay between me using an application for 10 minutes, and that respective information actually showing up when queried by the api?

Thank you, any help is appreciated.
## [12][Android dev here, what could I use to make a desktop app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ejlixr/android_dev_here_what_could_i_use_to_make_a/)

Hello

I am an Android developer with decent experience, both using java and kotlin, but now I want to make a desktop app. I use Linux, so that would be my target OS, but it also running on Windows and or Mac would be a nice plus.

I don't want to run an Android app on my desktop in an emulator (don't know if there is a way to do that with good integration with the desktop, clipboard, that also doesn't swallow all my ram), instead I want to know what I could try that might be more familiar to an Android developer, like some java framework or something high level, not plain java... you get the idea... kotlin native seems too low level and not fully stable, but I don't know, you tell me...


Thanks!

EDIT: I rememberd about [Ambox](https://anbox.io/), haven't tried it (yet).
