I'm looking to do some Golang freelance work and i'm currently in the proces of figuring out the best way to find work. I could ask my network or look at the dozens of recruiter emails I have in my inbox but I would rather find a source of work that is a bit more flexible/scalable. 

Ofcourse there is Upwork but maybe there are also smaller platform you would recommend? I would prefer smaller temporary projects instead of large ones but any tips are welcome! Thank you.

Hello, I developed a tool called Gaze in Go.

Gaze runs a command, right after you save a file.
It greatly helps you focus on writing code!

https://github.com/wtetsu/gaze

Go's greate libraries, cross-platform features and goroutine were quite useful for developing this tool!

Any comments will be appreciated, both for about the source code and the tool.

This package is based on similar functionality that Etsy.com uses to enable or disable various aspects of their application for user testing or rolling out new features. The goal was to make a super simple replica with consistent bucketing. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts. https://github.com/jimdoescode/feature
