Is there any plan when Inline classes going to be out of Experimental state as Kotlin Time library also depends on it and it is also in Experimental state.

Hi all,
I’m an undergrad researcher at a university and have been given a project developing an android app, despite having little programming experience. 
Kotlin seems to be the language I should start learning as it looks to be fitted for exactly my task. I’m a pretty fast learner, but I haven’t found many good resources for really STARTING (such as installation/SDKs). Could someone point me in the right direction, preferably free resources?

I study space engineering so coding is not my main thing actually, but I like it as hobby.
As of now I can code decently in c, c++ and Lua. 
I would like to start coding my own apps  and I've seen that Kotlin became the official language for Android.
I've already tried doing something and I really enjoy how Kotlin works.
However I was told that it would be better if I learned Java before learning Kotlin, is that true?
Any advice for a newbie?
