This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?

I hear this a lot. I wanted to ask this to Android developers and see what you guys all think. I have seen some people debunking this. But I also want to hear if this is true from you guys! 

Regarding me, I am more of a web developer and an Android user (and fan). But I have experimented with mobile apps in the past with the likes of Flutter and React Native. Although I would love to hear from you guys on whether or not this is true!

I am pretty new to Reddit, a European  Composer who writes royalty free music since 2007. About 2 weeks ago I  decided to upload all of my work on YT and my website and provide my  work for free. I cover a lot of genres, from cinematic to upbeat tracks  and I hope that my collection can come in handy.

The  last few tracks I composed as a "pack" which allows editors to customize  the music to their project. I would love some feedback as well. [Here you will find some of my music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qkEIL9H-99m-qfKThwoaA/).

**You  may use my music within your project(s), even commercially, at no  charge. A credit to my YT-channel or website is appreciated but not  required.**

**Restrictions:**

**You cannot claim my music as your own**  
**You cannot distribute my music in any store or platform**  
**You cannot use my music for audio podcasts or audiobooks**  
**You cannot edit my music, song or remix unless it is published as a “pack”**  
**You can use my music for facebook videos but you cannot register it within Facebook Rights Manager**

Right now there are about 120 tracks on my website, hope you will have fun browsing!

After my acquaintance with RxJava during my intern days. I almost always uses RxJava for concurrencies in Android projects. I am curious, is it the same for everyone else in this subreddit?

Hi, a company called Flippa offered to buy my app. I’ve no idea how to go about it, and I wonder if anyone has dealt with them before.
Are they legit? How to price the app? And is it worth it? Thanks!
## [8][May I use other app names in my play store description if it makes sense?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hdq62k/may_i_use_other_app_names_in_my_play_store/)

For example, if I integrated another app to automatically synchronize with mine or if I allow importing backups from other apps into mine, am I allowed to name them in my app store description?

Intuitively, I'd say that it is no problem, but Google can be very unpredictable sometimes.. So what is your advice?

I cannot trace the crash since it does not create a log from the classes I wrote. Did anyone experience such a thing and solve?

Any help is appreciated.
## [10][Singletons are not evil...right?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hdp5r2/singletons_are_not_evilright/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hdp5r2/singletons_are_not_evilright/

From my own experience, android dev is like gardening - there are wide variety of tools, and you have to be mindful to use the right tools for the job.

And I simply feel after many times revisioning my own demo apps, that using singletons is not evil at all, if done correctly.

My demo app involves my ViewModel class executing a Firebase Firestore query, returning a data class consisting of about a half dozen primitive types. 

Now, I could just store the data class inside a ViewModel, and then storing a copy inside a SavedStateHandle so that whenever the ViewModel resets - by the phone being rotated, the app paused or the Fragment changed with another, I can code for the ViewModel upon startup/reset to immediately call back the copy from the SavedStateHandle. 

But I imagine that this is just tedious and not code-efficient at all. Singular primitive types like Int, String are okay, but a whole data class? I need to actually serialize the whole data class into a String using Gson before saving it inside a ViewModel's SavedStateHandle. And then when the Viewmodel gets reset, I need to retrieve from SavedStateHandle and deserialize the String back to the date class (unless there is actually a more elegant way to do this that I do not know of?)

For small data classes, this is still okay. My demo app only queries small data classes from Firebase. But what if I need to download HUGE data classes instead? Like for example, market prices from stocks? Weather data? Directions between two coordinates on a map?

Then every time I retrieve a huge data class from a Firebase query, I need to serialize the whole data class before shoving it inside the ViewModel's SavedStateHandle, and this actually causes the app to pause and even freeze. This hampers the app's performance. The work load is doubled since the app also needs to deserialize too every single time the ViewModel is reset. 

What if I actually want to save the data class inside my app and then modify the variables inside the data class? I still need to serialize and deserialize, even though I just edited one variable inside the data class. 

It's like I'm using a machete to cut down a sequoia bark. It's just not the right tool for the job....when I can just use Object instead. 

But please, hear me out. When I place the data class I retrieved from the Firebase query into an Object, the data class inside the object persists for the whole life of the app - at least as I have observed. The data doesn't go away until the app closes. The data persists even if the Viewmodel gets reset. If I want to make some edits to the data class, I can just edit the variables directly and not have to worry about serializing and deserializing. 

But still, singletons, evil. Yeah. I read that in blogs and articles everywhere.

I am wracking my head here. Either I use Object and have an easier coding experience with the app running smoothly, or squeeze my brain like mad figuring out workaround solutions that still would end up with my app running slow because of all the serializing and deserializing, just to please other developers instead of the end user, because singletons are evil.

I need to please developers since I intend to show these demo apps to interviewers. But I am thinking if I just become a solo developer and make my apps purely for end users, I can be as evil as I want, right?

TL:DR; I love singletons but I am wary of using them for my demo apps because other devs say singletons are evil.

I have a paid app on PlayStore, the app has checks if the user has bought the app, if not I close it immediately.

I was wondering what you guys do when you detect that your app is cracked, like increasing the text size by each day, making buttons fade by each day, I don't know, share your ideas
