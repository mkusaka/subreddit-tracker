TL;DR: üëâ [hacker-ui.com](https://hacker-ui.com/)

About a month ago from today, I started working on a design system for my own personal projects. I wanted to create my own design language because the rest of them just felt too complex, too outdated, or too branded (for example Bootstrap is too old, Material UI is too Google-y).

I wanted a design system that wasn‚Äôt too complicated or special but just something that‚Äôs unbranded and aesthetically pleasing.

Anyway 30 days from realizing that, I have a design system I‚Äôm ready to share!

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúHacker UI‚Äù and I‚Äôm currently pitching it as ‚Äúthe hacker‚Äôs go-to design system‚Äù (similar to how Bootstrap was a go-to).

Features:

- 25+ components
- 25+ codesandbox examples
- New CSS-in-JS solution
- Composable styles by default 
- Full Typescript support

There‚Äôs still a lot to be done with this library (optimizations, SSR support, CI and testing, animations etc) but I‚Äôm still super excited to share.

Please let me know what you think!

I would like to implement this animation into a react app, I am not sure on best react approach using hooks, struggling to figure out the mental model.

GSAP TweenLite library is not a requirement, I am open to animation libraries (maybe react-spring) to achieve this.

## [7][What do y'all use for data fetching?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f3knj5/what_do_yall_use_for_data_fetching/)

We have a REST backend built with Java/Springboot and the team is not willing to add a GraphQL service, so using an auto-generated client and in general "fancy tech" like Apollo, Hasura, Prisma isn't really an option for me. Also every generator I tried that builds an API service based on Swagger/OpenAPI specs had some issues, so not sure if that's a good way forward.  
(still interested in your opinions and recommendations on these two fronts, though!)

Having said that, what solution are you currently using to handle data fetching ‚Äì and are you happy with it?

For now I'm using a couple basic "API functions" that essentially wrap Axios, and then calling them with a small self-written hook, which can be used like this:

    const token = useSelect(tokenSelector);
    const { state, data, error } = useAsyncData(
      () =&gt; api.getPosts(token, pagination),
      [token, pagination],
    );

But I see that as more of a stop-gap solution, the hook doesn't support manual re-fetching, probably has bugs, I still need to manually select and pass the token, and generally some more robust and tried-and-tested solution would be appreciated. Also not sure whether it makes sense to bundle and ship Axios.

My wishlist would be:

*  API can be used (conveniently) in functional &amp; class components as well as outside components (i.e. Redux thunks)
* I don't need to specify the endpoint every time I use the API
* I don't need to manually pass a token every time I use the API
* Support for typed responses so I can have autocomplete
* Allows manual re-fetching
* Some short-term caching (cached while browsing paginated data, may devalidate on route change)
* Codesplitting ‚Äì services only used in lazy-loaded components should be part of the split chunk

Right now, the best option I see is to stick with some simple API functions (based on Axios?), consuming them through [`zeit/swr`](https://github.com/zeit/swr), and then either integrating an Axios interceptor to sync with the token in Redux, or wrapping `useSWR()` in another hook that gets the token from Redux and adds it to the request.  


What are your approaches and libraries of choice?  
And more specifically, has anyone here used [`zeit/swr`](https://github.com/zeit/swr) for a large-scale application yet and can recommend it?

Hi all,

Background: my personal trainer mentioned that he is looking to create an online presence and said that he was looking for someone to build him a simple enough website (pretty much only a contact form and some extra plugins e.g. calendly) and i offered to do it. Ive been building personal react projects, so im confident in my ability to deliver a high quality product. Im just a little unsure about the business side of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do i deliver the product? by this i mean, I build the web app, then find somewhere to host it (probably AWS since i work here). He already has a domain, so do i just send him the folder containing the project and get him to upload it or would i create a brand new AWS account (or alternative) and give him the details etc after finishing? 

Any advice on this would be much appreciated. Thank you so much for your time!

I've heard a lot of people complaining about how they don't like the Hooks API, but I don't know what other API one would use, other than perhaps Vue's states based on observables, or perhaps some sort of "getter" function.

But I feel *pretty confident* that I understand hooks well enough to create a new API for it - if, of course, people can tell me what they want from it?

 Hey everyone!

I created a course that teaches how to build a react and graphQL based serverless recipe sharing application with Next.js, Auth0 and GraphCMS. I‚Äôm posing the source code that we build over the 10 hour course because I thought that y‚Äôall would enjoy it:

[https://github.com/CaptainChemist/next-chop](https://github.com/CaptainChemist/next-chop)

We start with a Next.js base typescript application that we style with the Ant Design component library. We then layer in Apollo using Hooks which connects to this really nice GraphCMS backend that makes it easy to upload images and data while we are still bootstrapping our site. We use GraphQLCodeGen for autogenerated graphQL model types which makes it really nice for creating hooks backed data fetching within our react components. We then use Auth0 for user login and a Next.js api function as a proxy to authorize all of the function calls that the user is making against the GraphCMS backend server.

If you like the code base, I created a 10+ hour course that shows how to do this step by step over at. I just launched it this week so I‚Äôd love any feedback:
