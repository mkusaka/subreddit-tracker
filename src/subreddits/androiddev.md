Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

## [5][My app indexing government bills was suspended - thinking of replacing with a "censored by google" message - looking for other suggestions too](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gfgm2s/my_app_indexing_government_bills_was_suspended/)

(this relates to the recent policy change around apps _mentioning_ coronavirus)

I'm working on an app that shows upcoming, ongoing, and past bills before parliament (in Australia), and going through the process for getting a closed pre-alpha distributed for testers. An unfinished part of this is allowing verified electors/voters to securely cast an (unofficial, nonbinding, etc) vote on whether they support a bill.

Part of this is, of course, showing the title of bills, and since there are 4+ bills with "coronavirus" in the title the app's not only been denied the _first_ review it went through **it was also suspended** (this was just for alpha release channel - tho not sure if a review here would let us publish this version).

Anyway, given this is meant to accurately show what's going on in a *democracy*, simply hiding the solution isn't a long term solution since the user isn't notified of something being hidden.

My idea currently is for this (and any future censorship ðŸ¤”) to show a red card with white text saying something like "This bill has been censored by &lt;Google&gt;. Tap for more info", and then replace the description-esq info with a similar message also including

* a censorship ID (i.e. would be the same for all coronavirus censorships)
* a reason, in this case something like "displaying this bill violates Google's policies for app distribution."
* a link to a website that explains the censorship and quotes the Developer Distribution Agreement.
* A link to a website that indexes the same information sans censorship.

That said, it might not elicit the best response from google, so I'm curious if anyone has any suggestions.

&gt; Another interesting thing is that this app (or a very related app) would be an interface between represented (non-government) parliamentarians and voters, which raises an interesting dilemma because we would not fall into any of the exemptions (similarly to how the Democrats in the US wouldn't be exempt)
&gt;
&gt; Furthermore, YouTube and all news apps should be removed since they aren't exempt either ðŸ˜¡

I developed a small application "Medium Unlimited" for Android, which lets you unlock articles behind the pay wall. You can also login and clap the unlocked articles.

Link: [https://github.com/firefinchdev/medium-unlimited-android/](https://github.com/firefinchdev/medium-unlimited-android/)

I am open to suggestions for improving the app. You can open issues suggesting improvements, bugs and feature requests. Would welcome PRs for the same. I will be actively working on them.

Also, please star the repo for updates.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: For those who can afford, please consider buying a subscription from the official app. It involves a lot of efforts to maintain a platform like Medium, and writers deserve to be awarded for their excellent content.

Hi, Android devs!

So the other day I was asking myself this question: how do you manage your preferences? I mean, not if using the SharedPreferences API, an encrypted Json or a plan text file in the user's internal storage, but in the application, the activity of handling the settings (e.g. notifications, colors, etc.).

Do you use a library? Do you make the activity manually and the a java class where you save the changes?

I'd be glad to know how you manage this!

Thanks!
## [12][How do you experiment with new features in mobile apps?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gfe733/how_do_you_experiment_with_new_features_in_mobile/)

Hey r/androiddev,

I'm Carmine, a researcher at the University of Zurich. Together with other researchers from Canada, The Netherlands, and Spain, I'm currently investigating how mobile app developers are experimenting with new features in their products.

For developers, it is hard to predict the success of a feature. For example, they cannot discover all defects during the testing phase and some defects will only appear after products are deployed to production. To mitigate the risk of delivering buggy features to users, developers often adopt incremental releasing strategies, such as Continuous Experimentation (CE). CE also helps developers to determine if the new features are successful in serving the business goals and refine or revert them if needed. 

Rather than delivering content directly through the web browser, mobile app users install applications on their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets). Mobile app developers need to deliver new releases from a software organization to app stores that curate mobile apps and make them available to users. In such a scenario, app stores might act as a bottleneck between software organizations and users, which may impose delays in the release process.

To better support mobile app developers, we ask you to share your expertise and experience by answering a few questions in the following survey: [http://tiny.uzh.ch/131](http://tiny.uzh.ch/131)

Our ultimate goal is to understand the state-of-the-art in applying CE in mobile apps. We are going to share the anonymized answers together with the analysis of the results with your community.

Comments and feedback to this post are very welcome!
