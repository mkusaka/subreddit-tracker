They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.

I'm not the kind of person that hates change just cause I'm stubborn. If you were improving it, power to ya, but you're not. You are busy making the experience worse. I guess I should thank you because I've been telling coworkers for years to use the CLI and that it's better, and now you are going out of your way to prove my point and drive people there. But sometimes it's just simpler to view a dashboard or play around with a new service using the console. Well, it used to be.\n\nYour transition over to the new UI aren't even smooth on some services. Take EC2 for instance. You rolled out the new look for the Autoscaling section, but most of the time when I navigate there I get the old UI with an error message. When I reload the page, the new UI loads and I can see my resources. Next, CloudWatch Logs. WHY THE HECK WOULD YOU MAKE IT LESS USER-FRIENDLY!? Usually you go to view logs when stuff is broken, often production systems, which is stressful enough. Now you've gone and changed the UI and made it worse. Something as stupid as switching between viewing logs as \"Text\" vs \"Row\" is now in a sub menu in a drop down, why?\n\nThat leads me to my next point, sub menus and drop downs. Everything is in a collapsible element. That's freaking annoying. Sometimes you want to copy some text to share with a colleague, but as soon as you click to highlight, the blooming thing expands or retracts  and moves the element. Ultimately you can do what you want to do, yes, but it takes longer. In high paced, high pressure environments, crap like that is something no one needs.\n\nIt's one thing to make something look better, but most people that uses AWS don't care about looks. We want functionality and ease of use. It can look like a dog's breakfast for all we care, it just has to work!!\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nAs I said at the start, I'm sure most of my frustrations is because you are making the UI less user-friendly for people with vision problems. You are making it harder for me to do my job, and I really don't need anyone to do that.\n\nThe old UI was basic, simple, and it was really clear where one section ended and another started. There was less collapsable elements and hidden menus. Yes, sometimes you had to scroll till your fingers went numb, but at least it didn't require clicking on 4 different little arrows and two sub-menus to get to the info you want.\n\nI highlight text that I want my screen reader to read out loud. But it feels like 70% of the time I try that technique with the new UI it doesn't work. The text is either some kind of link or action button that opens a collapsable element, or the reader doesn't pick it up as text. Now I know the first response to that last one will be \"maybe your screen reader is the issue.\" But why then is it only on your website? I don't know what kind of UI framework you use, but it's not very accessibility-friendly. It's pretty much impossible to read text in a table. It either doesn't read, or it reads the entire table, no matter which cell I'm highlighting. The worst part is that you're now using this same thing for your documentation pages. I'm basically losing my mind cause I can't read the freaking docs!\n\nThen there is the moving of buttons and options and inconsistent UI's. I'm not talking about the UI being inconsistent across services, it's always been like that. That's something I learned to love about the old UI. I'm talking about something like the Lambda console. Select a function and navigate to the \"Configuration\" tab. All the config sections are full screen-width blocks, except the X-Ray one. In addition to the screen reader, I use a screen zoom function. So I don't see the whole screen. So I basically scrolled up and down and up and down in search of the X-Ray section, thinking I'm not seeing it. Only to find out, nope, that one config block is sitting on the right side of the page, outside the view of the zoom. Again, you could say that's not your problem, but it kinda is. If all the configs were side-by-side, I would be hovering left to right all the way down the page.\n\nThe moving of buttons is one of those things that make me want to scream. With the old UI, most of the action buttons is on the left hand side at the top. Now you moved it to the right, but not on all pages. Why? Why would you move something just for the sake of moving it? \"It looks better there.\", no it doesn't. It looks the same, it's just orange instead of blue and on the right instead of the left. Most people don't know this, but people with vision problems don't read all the menus/buttons. They memorize button names, link text, and the placement of it to speed up their workflow. Now I basically have to start over.\n\nAnd finally let's get to colors, fonts, and shadows. The old UI, again, was basic. Black text on a white page, when highlighted it was substantially bolder, and when on a button it was Bol white text on a dark blue background. Here and there there was a menu with white text on black backgrounds. Now everything is a much more modern font, which is thinner and harder to read when highlighted since it doesn't get much bolder. Some pages have colors that are so light that's impossible to see white text, and pages are so busy to cram all the info into a single view, that everything just feels cramped and the font feels smaller.\n\nI can go on, but I'd be pretty surprised if anyone made it this far. I also feel a bit better now, even though as soon as I navigate away from here I'm going back to the console and that kinda sucks.\n\nAs I said, I'm not a person that hates change. You updated the Support Center to have the new UI, and apart from the fact that I can't use my screen reader to read the table with all the open cases, it's nice. There's not much wrong with that page and you did a good job there. It's still user-friendly, even for me. Yeah the font/color issue is there too, but other than that.\n\nI'm not the kind of person to just bitch and moan about something and not do something about it. This rant must sound like me bitching and moaning, and honestly, if I was allowed to use all the cuss words that came to mind, it probably would sound more like a rant. But I am willing to help wherever I can to help you improve the console experience. If I have to submit all my suggestions or take screen recordings to explain my situation, I'd gladly do that. I'm just not going to do it if it's going to get ignored. Rather ignore this then.\n\nPS: It's not just AWS that's making this mistake. Even the folks here at Reddit made that mistake with their new look. It's impossible for me to use with my assistive technologies, so I'm still using the old UI.

Everything is in a collapsible element. That&amp;#39;s freaking annoying. Sometimes you want to copy some text to share with a colleague, but as soon as you click to highlight, the blooming thing expands or retracts  and moves the element. Ultimately you can do what you want to do, yes, but it takes longer. In high paced, high pressure environments, crap like that is something no one needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one thing to make something look better, but most people that uses AWS don&amp;#39;t care about looks. We want functionality and ease of use. It can look like a dog&amp;#39;s breakfast for all we care, it just has to work!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said at the start, I&amp;#39;m sure most of my frustrations is because you are making the UI less user-friendly for people with vision problems. You are making it harder for me to do my job, and I really don&amp;#39;t need anyone to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old UI was basic, simple, and it was really clear where one section ended and another started. There was less collapsable elements and hidden menus. Yes, sometimes you had to scroll till your fingers went numb, but at least it didn&amp;#39;t require clicking on 4 different little arrows and two sub-menus to get to the info you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I highlight text that I want my screen reader to read out loud. But it feels like 70% of the time I try that technique with the new UI it doesn&amp;#39;t work. The text is either some kind of link or action button that opens a collapsable element, or the reader doesn&amp;#39;t pick it up as text. Now I know the first response to that last one will be &amp;quot;maybe your screen reader is the issue.&amp;quot; But why then is it only on your website? I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of UI framework you use, but it&amp;#39;s not very accessibility-friendly. It&amp;#39;s pretty much impossible to read text in a table. It either doesn&amp;#39;t read, or it reads the entire table, no matter which cell I&amp;#39;m highlighting. The worst part is that you&amp;#39;re now using this same thing for your documentation pages. I&amp;#39;m basically losing my mind cause I can&amp;#39;t read the freaking docs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there is the moving of buttons and options and inconsistent UI&amp;#39;s. I&amp;#39;m not talking about the UI being inconsistent across services, it&amp;#39;s always been like that. That&amp;#39;s something I learned to love about the old UI. I&amp;#39;m talking about something like the Lambda console. Select a function and navigate to the &amp;quot;Configuration&amp;quot; tab. All the config sections are full screen-width blocks, except the X-Ray one. In addition to the screen reader, I use a screen zoom function. So I don&amp;#39;t see the whole screen. So I basically scrolled up and down and up and down in search of the X-Ray section, thinking I&amp;#39;m not seeing it. Only to find out, nope, that one config block is sitting on the right side of the page, outside the view of the zoom. Again, you could say that&amp;#39;s not your problem, but it kinda is. If all the configs were side-by-side, I would be hovering left to right all the way down the page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moving of buttons is one of those things that make me want to scream. With the old UI, most of the action buttons is on the left hand side at the top. Now you moved it to the right, but not on all pages. Why? Why would you move something just for the sake of moving it? &amp;quot;It looks better there.&amp;quot;, no it doesn&amp;#39;t. It looks the same, it&amp;#39;s just orange instead of blue and on the right instead of the left. Most people don&amp;#39;t know this, but people with vision problems don&amp;#39;t read all the menus/buttons. They memorize button names, link text, and the placement of it to speed up their workflow. Now I basically have to start over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally let&amp;#39;s get to colors, fonts, and shadows. The old UI, again, was basic. Black text on a white page, when highlighted it was substantially bolder, and when on a button it was Bol white text on a dark blue background. Here and there there was a menu with white text on black backgrounds. Now everything is a much more modern font, which is thinner and harder to read when highlighted since it doesn&amp;#39;t get much bolder. Some pages have colors that are so light that&amp;#39;s impossible to see white text, and pages are so busy to cram all the info into a single view, that everything just feels cramped and the font feels smaller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can go on, but I&amp;#39;d be pretty surprised if anyone made it this far. I also feel a bit better now, even though as soon as I navigate away from here I&amp;#39;m going back to the console and that kinda sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, I&amp;#39;m not a person that hates change. You updated the Support Center to have the new UI, and apart from the fact that I can&amp;#39;t use my screen reader to read the table with all the open cases, it&amp;#39;s nice. There&amp;#39;s not much wrong with that page and you did a good job there. It&amp;#39;s still user-friendly, even for me. Yeah the font/color issue is there too, but other than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the kind of person to just bitch and moan about something and not do something about it. This rant must sound like me bitching and moaning, and honestly, if I was allowed to use all the cuss words that came to mind, it probably would sound more like a rant. But I am willing to help wherever I can to help you improve the console experience. If I have to submit all my suggestions or take screen recordings to explain my situation, I&amp;#39;d gladly do that. I&amp;#39;m just not going to do it if it&amp;#39;s going to get ignored. Rather ignore this then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: It&amp;#39;s not just AWS that&amp;#39;s making this mistake. Even the folks here at Reddit made that mistake with their new look. It&amp;#39;s impossible for me to use with my assistive technologies, so I&amp;#39;m still using the old UI. Yeah it looks like something that was created 20 years ago, but it works, and that&amp;#39;s what matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

Something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;filter appLog.payload.responses.*.key == &amp;#39;message&amp;#39;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e6592206-1ce0-11e9-a9e6-0e7bd20fa500", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh84", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "h08p73", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ikhurramraza", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/aws/comments/h08p73/advanced_filtering_in_aws_cloudwatch/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/h08p73/advanced_filtering_in_aws_cloudwatch/", "subreddit_subscribers": 126037, "created_utc": 1591787178.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "aws", "selftext": "It seems with the recent price reduction, and the optional compute savings plans, Fargate has possibly become much more attractive for 24/7 workloads now.\n\nJust curious about real world experience feedback such as cost, performance and general feedback.\n\nThinking about making the switch.", "author_fullname": "t2_avmmd", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Anyone switched from ECS with EC2 to Fargate for 24/7 workloads?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aws", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_h09m21", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "technical question", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1591819758.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.aws", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems with the recent price reduction, and the optional compute savings plans, Fargate has possibly become much more attractive for 24/7 workloads now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just curious about real world experience feedback such as cost, performance and general feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking about making the switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e0acaab0-fe51-11e8-b457-0e86fa5111f4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh84", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "h09m21", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "softwareguy74", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/aws/comments/h09m21/anyone_switched_from_ecs_with_ec2_to_fargate_for/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/h09m21/anyone_switched_from_ecs_with_ec2_to_fargate_for/", "subreddit_subscribers": 126037, "created_utc": 1591790958.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "aws", "selftext": "Hi there\n\nI've a Route53 record which has a georouting policy attached.
