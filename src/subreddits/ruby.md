I recently gave some thought into how I've _broken_ the single responsibiltiy principle throughout my career as a software engineer and came up with an interesting analogy using a pencil.

This thread has been a great help in passion and commercial projects. I was curious, how many Ruby developers work in outsourcing companies? I wrote an article about ( [https://syndicode.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-software-outsourcing-risks/](https://syndicode.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-software-outsourcing-risks/) ) outsourcing risks that basically describe everything that could go wrong. I'd like to enrich it with insights of other Ruby developers, Could you share what were your experiences?

I am building a Ruby implementation with an ahead-of-time compiler, built atop LLVM with Crystal.  


I tried to avoid LLVM, by using GCC (as compiler back-end), but I think that is more painful than LLVM.  


So, I switched from GCC and C to LLVM and Crystal, since Crystal has LLVM bindings.  


Clearly, I don't have the "manpower" to do that my self and I need help.  


I am already writing the asbtract-syntax-tree parser, (and that is probably is one of the hardest things to do, given the complexity of Ruby's syntax) if anyone is interested, pm me.  


PS: Obviously, some features like monkey-patching there will not be there, my aim is an implementation like Crystal.
