I created a Dashboard in React and CSS Grid for practice.

It is not yet responsive. But, I learnt a lot about CSS grid through this.

Used a design from u/dribbble

Deployed on [https://dashboard-in-react.vercel.app/](https://dashboard-in-react.vercel.app/) / github repo - [https://github.com/malhotra-parul/dashboard](https://github.com/malhotra-parul/dashboard)

Any suggestions are welcome. :)

Hi all :)

I'm trying to build a simple puzzle game and would like to create a Stopwatch that counts from the moment the level starts.

So.. I managed to got to the point where the clock start, runs,  stop and reset as desired.

BUT every time i do something else on the UI the clock waits the load time of that operation.

How can i isolate the clock component completely from the other parts of the UI but still control 

its start, stop and reset function ? 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not a pro on React and maybe my thinking on the structure is not optimal,

any advice is welcome.

Thank you in advance for anyone that reads and/or answers :) 

&amp;#x200B;

here is the Stopwatch component (and its data):

There is a stats in the parent component:

const \[clockData,  setClockData\] = useState( { isOn: false, reset: false } );

* isOn - for start and stop
* reset - should the clock reset

&amp;#x200B;

    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    
    const StopWatch = ({ clockData, setClockData }) =&gt; {
      const [time, setTime] = useState({ sec: 0, min: 0 });
      
      const tick = () =&gt; { 
        if(time.sec &gt; 59) {
          setTime({sec: 0, min: time.min + 1});
        }
        else {
          setTime({sec: time.sec + 1, min: time.min});
        }
      }
    
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        if(clockData.reset) {
          setTime({ sec: 0, min: 0 });
          setClockData({ isOn: true, reset: false });
        } 
        if(clockData.isOn) {
          let interval = setInterval(() =&gt; { tick() }, 1000);
          return () =&gt; {
            clearInterval(interval);
          }
        }
      });
      
      const showClock = () =&gt; {
          if(time.min &lt; 10) {
            return (
              &lt;p&gt;0{time.min}:{time.sec &lt; 10 ? &lt;span&gt;0{time.sec}&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span&gt;{time.sec}&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
            )
          }
          else {
            return (
              &lt;p&gt;{time.min}:{time.sec &lt; 10 ? &lt;span&gt;0{time.sec}&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span&gt;{time.sec}&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/p&gt; 
            )
          }
      }
    
      return (
        &lt;div className="StopWatch"&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;{showClock()}&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      );
    }
    export default StopWatch;

Hello all,

I've been working really hard on [Embla Carousel v.3](https://davidcetinkaya.github.io/embla-carousel/) and it's finally here. Here's how it turned out:

* üëâ Even better swipe accuracy
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Support for vertical carousels
* üöÄ Exposing its core for maximum extensibility
* üíª CodeSandboxes for every example
* üì¶ Reduced bundle size
* üìã Brand new [documentation &amp; examples page](https://davidcetinkaya.github.io/embla-carousel)

&amp;#x200B;

[It's possible to extend Embla Carousel to build 3D carousels](https://reddit.com/link/i8kept/video/wj3fr6lk0qg51/player)

  
**For those of you** **not familiar with** [Embla Carousel](https://davidcetinkaya.github.io/embla-carousel), it's a carousel I created because I was frustrated about the large bundle sizes and quality that the existing javascript carousels had to offer. Stuff like poor touch/swipe accuracy and slow loop effects pushed me to try solve this challenges.

Feedback is much appreciated!

David

I am looking for some library or example on how to create a reactjs app to load and edit a video. What I'm looking for is to simply load the video and cut it, where I specify the start and end time. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

I have a component that rerenders some of its parts because of async data fetch, but I want to have some sort of flag when all of it finished loading.
