* How do I pass data between my Activities?

* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

To give some backstory I'm a new grad who graduated in may of this year who has been looking for an android dev job since then. I've done 3 internships so far in college and in my 2nd one I came to love android dev when that was my given tech stack. I wanted to branch out and try to fullstack in my 3rd internship and came to realize that wasn't for me. When it was time to look for jobs in my senior year covid happened and I legit could barely find anyone hiring let alone interviewing for android jobs. Recently I just got hired at a company that was a generally software engineer position. I told my recruiter that I really was looking for mobile dev and if possible android however after accepting the offer they finally told me what my day to day dev work is and its sadly not mobile dev (its java springwork/microservices). To say I'm not bummed out would be an understatement. I only took this job offer honestly cause I couldn't find anywork for 5 months and I need to make money somehow. Sadly I'm worried how hard it'd be for me to apply for android roles in the future when they start asking for years of android experience. I don't want to be pigeonholed into doing dev work I'm not passionate about.

My application currently supports subscriptions via the play-store. However it does not yet support `Account Hold` which is mandatory by November 2020. What will happen to my app if it doesn't support `Account Hold` by 1st November 2020?

## [7][Hiding toolbar and bottom nav in certain screens (navigation component)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/j372j4/hiding_toolbar_and_bottom_nav_in_certain_screens/)

Okay so I've tried these two ways:

1. Hiding toolbar and bottom nav in the onDestinationChanged listener: This causes some flickering and doesn't look good if I'm using transitions like slide.
2. Creating multiple nav hosts. One for the whole screen and another for the screen between toolbar and bottom nav: This doesn't have any flickering or transition problems but it feels hacky when I want to navigate to a root destination from the inner nav host (like using a view model).

I know this has been asked many times but I can't really find a good answer that eliminates both the problems. How do you guys handle this scenario?

Why so much boilerplate for a simple BannerAd!? :\\

**AdContainerView** is a simple, lifecycle aware, plug &amp; play wrapper over Google AdMob's AdView (Banner Ad), which handles most of the stuff by itself.

For the simplest use:  
You just need to add **AdContainerView** in your layout,  
define 3 parameters: `adUnitId`, `adSize`, `autoLoad` &amp; **that's it!**

**AdContainerView** hooks to your Activity's lifecycle process &amp; handles AdView's lifecycle (Resume, Pause, Destroy Ad).  
This is most helpful when you just want to add a simple Banner Ad without any boilerplate.

The library is written in Kotlin.  
More info. on Github: [https://github.com/ItzNotABug/AdContainerView](https://github.com/ItzNotABug/AdContainerView)

Hit the ‚≠êÔ∏è if you find it useful :)  
Also, reviews and suggestions are more than welcome :)

Also, are there some unspoken rules/etiquette of OS?
