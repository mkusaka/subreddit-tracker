* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

When running an app for longer than 5-20 minutes on a emulator device running a non-google-api x86-64 API 29 image, the app ui just freezes up while the activity / UI thread still runs in the background.

To recreate make an empty android project, create a layout with a single textview and write a activity with a value animator which updates the textview contents with the current playtime.

Let this run for 5-20 minutes while the activity is in the foreground and the app ui will freeze up while the activity / UI thread is still running in the background.

Am i crazy or is anyone else also experiencing this strange behaviour?

On images below API 29 this bug does not seem to happen.

I am releasing a game in a couple of months for mobile, and have commercials filmed. Curious to how long a typical ad cycle would be. I have 4 different ads and was thinking to feature each ad for one week over the course of a month to diversify. So pretty much one ad a week. Primarily platform we are interested in is Instagram as it tends to be a goldmine for hyper-casual.

Thanks in advance - anything helps at this point.

## [9][How can I specify ad type in placements in Appodeal](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/essydg/how_can_i_specify_ad_type_in_placements_in/)

I'm trying to integrate Appodeal but I found the dashboard UI quite different from other ad networks.  


1. In Admob or Facebook Audeience network I usually have to choose if a placement is interstitial, banner or rewarded video when I create them.

I don't see such an option in the Appodeal's placement dashboard.

2. When I add FAN as network in appodeal, do I map line items to placements ?

I am planning/considering to move and live in Germany (Berlin or Munich undecided at the moment) for maybe 3-4 months maybe longer.

Are there contract jobs available? And what would be the best way for me to find them? 

I am also considering applying for full time positions however I would feel guilty only working at a place for 3-4 months only to have them search for a replacement.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
