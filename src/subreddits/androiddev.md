Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

Have been out of touch with the topic lately, have I missed anything about the most elegant way of injecting a ViewModel into Fragment/Activity using Dagger 2?

I want to set network requests on periodic interval to see if any notifications come from my server. Currently I am using job service for this but it didn't seem to be periodically running.

For example: 

1st time it sent the request after 15 minutes

2nd time it sent the request after 15 minutes after the 1st

3rd time it sent the request after 60 minutes after the 2nd

4th time it sent the request after 15 minutes after the 3rd

5th time it sent the request after 15 minutes after the 4th

Here is my code:

JobScheduler scheduler = (JobScheduler) getSystemService(*JOB\_SCHEDULER\_SERVICE*);  
ComponentName componentName = new ComponentName(this,NotificationService.class);  
JobInfo info = new JobInfo.Builder(1,componentName).setPeriodic(1000 \* 60 \* 15).setPersisted(true).build();  
scheduler.schedule(info);

&amp;#x200B;

I am very new to android so i think i'm missing something here. What should i do?
## [12][Getting Google Play App To Show Up In Google Search](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g2y92a/getting_google_play_app_to_show_up_in_google/)

I have two apps published on the play store. If i search on the play store I can find both apps without any issues. If i go to google search and search for the app, it doesn't find anything. I can see competitor apps show up in search engine results. Why is my app not showing up when i perform a Google search?

&amp;#x200B;

Both apps were published in December 2019. Both appear if you search the play store but neither show up in traditional [google.com](https://google.com) searches.
