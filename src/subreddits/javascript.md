## [4][[AskJS] Static site that serves markdown pages?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/jtwwwb/askjs_static_site_that_serves_markdown_pages/)

Are there static site generators that allow you to serve markdown on the fly, without converting them to html files first?

Right now I'm using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) which does exactly that, you just edit the markdown pages and the changes are immediate without needing to rebuild the whole website. But I don't like how some things are implemented and I'm looking for alternatives.

Hey community! I'm in an argument with my roommate which is a JavaScript developer like me. He says vanilla is a separate framework or a library or whatever but for me it's just plain JavaScript, a way of saying that you're not using a framework. Please help, if I'm right I win a beer!
