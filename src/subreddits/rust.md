Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

Welcome once again to the official /r/rust Who's Hiring thread!

Before we begin, job-seekers should also remember to peruse [the prior thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dvxw6u/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

This thread will be periodically stickied to the top of /r/rust every week, for improved visibility. The thread will be refreshed and posted anew when the next version of Rust releases in six weeks.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting (adapted from /r/cpp's jobs thread).

#### Rules for individuals:

* Don't create top-level comments; those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with on-topic questions.
* I will create a stickied top-level comment for individuals looking for work.
* I will create an additional top-level comment for meta discussion.

#### Rules for employers:

* To find individuals seeking work, see the replies to the stickied top-level comment; you will need to click the "more comments" link below that comment in order to see them.
* To make a top-level comment you must be hiring directly; no third-party recruiters.
* One top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* Proofread your comment after posting it and edit it if necessary to correct mistakes.
* Please base your comment on the following template:

COMPANY: *[Company name; please link to your company's website or careers page.]*

TYPE: *[Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]*

DESCRIPTION: *[What does your company do, and what are you using Rust for? How much experience are you seeking and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details the better.]*

LOCATION: *[Where are your office or offices located? If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]*

REMOTE: *[Do you offer the option of working remotely? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]*

VISA: *[Does your company sponsor visas?]*

CONTACT: *[How can someone get in touch with you?]*

I've been working on a music theory library for a while, the purpose is to cover all the theoretical knowledge in the code, slowly but surely getting there. Will be adding more functionality over time.

The choice of Rust turned out to be great for this kind of library. Helped covering the edge cases with all the musical notions like Scale, Chord etc. 

Wanted to share here for anyone interested in music;

[github](https://github.com/Renmusxd/RustQIP), [docs](https://docs.rs/qip/), [crates](https://crates.io/crates/qip)

QIP is a quantum circuit building API and simulator. By making use of the borrow checker in rust, the compiler can enforce the no-cloning theorem central to quantum computation. 

You make a [circuit builder](https://docs.rs/qip/0.10.4/qip/builders/struct.OpBuilder.html) from which you can [make qubits and act on them with operators](https://docs.rs/qip/0.10.4/qip/builders/trait.UnitaryBuilder.html). Each qubit is protected by the rustlang ownership rules, so you can never accidentally act on the same qubit more than expected. Then you can run the circuit by referencing one of the qubits, and get [measurements](https://docs.rs/qip/0.10.4/qip/builders/struct.OpBuilder.html#method.measure) from the simulated quantum circuit. See the [examples](https://github.com/Renmusxd/RustQIP/tree/master/examples) directory for more details on how each of these work.

The library also includes a macro with a domain specific language which can translate quantum circuit "pseudocode" into a valid circuit (See [here](https://docs.rs/qip/0.10.4/qip/#the-program-macro)).

QIP uses rayon for parallelism, it has no unsafe code, and compiles on the rust stable channel. 

This has been a personal project for quite some time, and I've finally decided to uplift it to an open source project by introducing it to the community. I am accepting pull requests, and would greatly appreciate any help improving code quality, api choices, or efficiency. I try to keep code updated and add regularly but sometimes grad school gets in the way.

Thank you!

[https://github.com/arthmis/imageproc-website](https://github.com/arthmis/imageproc-website)

This is my first time posting and first majorish project. The goal of the website is to bring together different image processing techniques. I wanted to make the algorithms and what they do more accessible for people who are beginners to image processing(I'm a beginner too) by adding sliders or buttons to change inputs along with high level explanations. 

It's still in its infant stages, but I will eventually implement and demo all image processing techniques like histograms, waveforms, resizing, rotation, corner detection, etc. I didn't use imageproc because my goal is to learn about the different algorithms by implementing them. 

Feedback on the explanations for the algorithms are welcome.

So I've been doing a lot of googling to figure out how to profile my rust applications on windows, my best way right now is putting in code that measures time inside my programs.  
I tried using the visual studio performance profiler, which I got to save out a performance report once, but now it's been stuck for 40 mins trying to load its 84kb file.  
So yeah, is profiling on windows viable?
