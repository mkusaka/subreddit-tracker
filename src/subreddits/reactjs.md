Hello all,

For Nodejs I am using Morgan + Winston. However, I would like to get in place a logging system in my front-end, where I only show console.log during development and if there is an error then I can send an email or make an API query to log the state of the front-end at the error time.

Therefore, I would like to know what are the common solutions that people use in real-world or whether this is a homemade solution normally.  


Ideally free.  


Thank you in advance and regards.

Sorry if this is very basic and has been asked before, but I've started learning react for the past few days during Easter while stuck in quarantine :)

I've been using react starting with the default "npx create-react-app", to build some UI's, I've also gone through the react documentation and tutorial on the official website, and I am now familiar with rendering components with JSX and using state/props. 

I've used nodejs, express, pugjs before, and want to rewrite an application to use nodejs + react. How do I implement the backend nodejs code to hook into react? Do I just start adding nodejs/express code into the default App.js or index.js of my react app? 

If I write some simple javascript or do something like "console.log()" in these files, I am not getting any output. 

The default package.json file has a start script "react-scripts start", does this need to be changed so that nodejs/express start first before using react? Similar to: "node server.js" then somehow call react components later?

Also, would I be able to host the website on a hosting service such as Siteground? Sorry for the basic questions, this is my first web development project!

Thanks in advance!
