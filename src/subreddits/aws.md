Over the past year, we've done a lot of experimenting in serverless and data analytics. Unfortunately, we have a lot of resources that still exist throughout our accounts that are hard to track down. We've already cleaned up our cloudformation stacks but unfortunately not everyone has used cloudformation, so there are is no one button click solution of deleting old stuff.

What is your tried and true method of listing ALL resources across all regions for when you need to do a Spring (or in this case Fall) cleaning?

Hi all - I'm interested in understanding how to set something like this up.  The Landing Zone documentation is overwhelming for a smaller business setup.  I'm mostly interested in breaking out each piece and understanding the thinking behind the best practices for setting up this type of architecture.  Mix of custom apps, commercial apps, and SaaS integrations.  Any thoughts greatly appreciated.  (FYI - I am a PM working on large scale AWS projects for 2 years now and am really looking forward to getting a deeper dive into the tech.  Passed SAA-02 but am getting really bored with reading docs and watching videos about features in isolation and want to dig into some real learning about solid design).  Thanks.

I get fed up of headphones after a few hours on a call. **3 weeks!** I might have to change my audio settings to external speakers. (I am fortunate to be working from home.)

Hi. I need to find dynamic analysis tools to infer data about the infrastructure of the system. Someone knows?

I know the existence of static ones, but my interest is really in dynamic ones.

Hello everyone ! 

 I already have the Security+, Network+ and CEH certificate and no experience so I'm very academic and I was wondering if anyone would have any suggestions for passing the AWS certificate with no experience .. and learning straight from the book and possibly some interact websites that would help me understand everything and completing the four certificates before I enter the job force. Let me know if you guys have any suggestions:) thanks

With the general availability of Nitro Enclaves I decided to build the ACM solution and find out what it's all about.

I wrote a two-part article about my findings. [Part 1](https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=enclaves_part_1) is a 30.000 foot overview, [part 2](https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=enclaves_part_2) is a technical deep dive on the security of Nitro Enclaves.
## [10][Advice regarding GitHub -&gt; CodePipeline "manual approval" for production](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/jl32la/advice_regarding_github_codepipeline_manual/)

Greetings folks.

I'm hoping to get some advice about gluing GitHub and CodePipeline together.

Right now, I have a site that is built with CodePipeline when code is committed to a specific branch in a GitHub branch.  That all works.

For the Staging -&gt; Prod step, I have a manual approval stage.   It works well enough, but the person who needs to do the approvals isn't the kind of person who will be comfortable navigating the AWS console or using the CLI.  I'd like to expose approvals in GitHub.  I'm not sure the easiest/cleanest way to implement that.

I've explored writing a bot that can monitor the pull request so when the approver @mentions it, it can be approved but that has proven a bit beyond me in the short term.

I can create separate staging and production branches, but then it's technically a new build/artifact that gets deployed to production than staging. It's a bit slower that way, and if any dependencies are updated up stream between staging merge and production merge, it's not technically the exact same artifact that is built and heading to production.

I've spent a lot of time searching for an elegant solution, but so far no dice. 

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks.

The AWS Landing Zone Upgrade Guide is not accessible for the last few hours. I was able to access until yesterday. Is something changed? Anyone aware of this.
