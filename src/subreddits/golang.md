Hey guys, 2 weeks ago we open-sourced our [GraphQL with ent](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/j2ljgh/ent_gqlgen_3/), and today, I'm super happy to share that we open-sourced our privacy layer (authorization) for ent. 

One of the main advantages of the privacy layer is that, you write the privacy policy once (in the schema), and it is always evaluated. No matter where queries and mutations are performed in your codebase, it will always go through the privacy layer.

The docs is available in [entgo.io/docs/privacy](https://entgo.io/docs/privacy), and you're more than welcome to go over it and share with me your feedback in the issue tracker ([github.com/facebook/ent](https://github.com/facebook/ent/pulls)).

Run a single Go applications on x86 bare metal, except for some assembly and C, most of the code is written in Go, support most features of Go (like GC, goroutine) and standard libraries, also come with a network stack that can run most `net` based libraries.

**tl;dr: What concepts do I need to master to become an industry-ready, hireable Golang Software Developer.**  


Hello nice people of r/golang, hope you're all safe and doing well. I've been for some time now a member of this community, though not very active, I'm always looking around.   


This year as many of you know have been very hard for everybody, and I think I've hit a weird point in my career. After being a freelancer mostly developing in Golang for the last two years I've come to the conclusion that probably I won't be able to complete my Systems Engineering degree (Computer Science department) and will now have to think about going forward on my career without a degree. Golang is a programming language that I really enjoy programming in, and I've put a lot of effort into learning and improving my skills.   


I can hold my ground with most of the builtin constructs, concepts, and packages. I know how to work and group goroutines, set up web services, use third-party APIs, use most of the os-related packages, and so on.  


I guess that my question is, what do I need to learn to become an industry-ready software developer assuming that I know most of the essentials on CS? (Algorithms and Data Structures, some OS-concepts, etc)

Most of the problem-solving sites allow you to solve the problems in various languages and Go is one of them in most platforms. The problem is these problems, in most cases doesn't require where Go shines, e.g. Concurrency. Is there any problem-solving site where I can work on my Go-specific skills?

I have a coding but it's not working on yagpdb.
Plz share me a coding to solve my problem.
Thanks in advance.

This is 👇🏼 coding for zalgo. I got it from Google search.
