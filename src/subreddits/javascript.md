Hi there, I'm a very experienced engineer but I've barely touched frontend web technologies in my career. I know the ecosystem in javascript changes very quickly, so everything I knew before (7+ years ago) is outdated.  I'm interested in learning more and would like some feedback on my current thoughts:

I want to build web, iOS, and Android apps using React + React Native. Here are the tools I was thinking about:
- Expo for build tools and smoothing out the React Native experience
- TypeScript as the language for type safety benefits

I'm curious what people like to use for
- Unit testing and integration/system testing
- HTTP requests
- Animations
- Anything that makes CSS more sane
- Layout

Are there any must use libraries (I remember hearing a lot a few years back about Flux)? I'm curious what libraries and tools are generally accepted as "must use" in the community, and which libraries and tools have flame wars and the pros and cons of each side.

If you have any thoughts on my approach, why it sucks, what to add or remove, or any color to add, please let me know.

Thanks!

Is it just me, or it really is JS for the next decade. JS for everything and C for your washing machine?

We have a diverse stack in my organization - ruby, python, js, Java, c#. On the browser we are fixed - no choice there, and at least internally in my organization it is getting more and more common to move everything to JS. No need to traverse these trees both in browser with JS and on server with python. Just use the same code and since you are fixed on the browser this code is JS. 

You need desktop - JS. 
You need mobile - JS. 
You need server - js.  

You have the ide - which is the browser. You need more - Microsoft are doing some text editors. 

It seems like really naturally we finally have one code base for everything. The prophecy that was once made is probably already fulfilling. Yes, the technology is different, but the chosen one has emerged.

What do you think? Is there even place for anything else? Why would you undertake a new project in a technology that is not JS when you can build with JS and deliver everywhere, reuse from everywhere and yes..slap you head from time to time when fighting different problems, but at least you would slap your head .. consistently.
