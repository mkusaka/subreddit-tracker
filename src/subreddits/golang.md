I have about 1 year experience with the language, already did 2 projects with it (web apps). I still feel that I'm not doing it the 'idiomatic' way, and I didn't use channels, etc.
The thing is I'm developing alone, there's no 'senior' developer to guide me. And I can't find 'advanced golang' courses online, to help me become a really good golang developer. Also I don't think I'm good enough to contribute to open source projects.
Is there a book/course that would help me become a really good golang developer? Thank you

I have a slightly strange problem, My team have been working with vault and golang on our internal cli tool.

We have ended up using:

`github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` &lt;-- has a go.mod

and

`github.com/hashicorp/vault/commands` &lt;-- doesn't have a go.mod so inherits from `github.com/hashicorp/vault`

I am trying to update vault/api to the latest version 1.3.3:

```
github.com/hashicorp/vault v1.3.3
github.com/hashicorp/vault/api v1.3.3
```

The problem is I get:

`go: github.com/hashicorp/vault/api@v1.3.3: reading github.com/hashicorp/vault/api/api/go.mod at revision api/v1.3.3: unknown revision api/v1.3.3`

which I think is caused by this root module and a conflict. does that make sense? any ideas what to do in this case?
