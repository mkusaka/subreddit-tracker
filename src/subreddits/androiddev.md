* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [6][native Android app with Kotlin and Rust - code review request](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g1k5zh/native_android_app_with_kotlin_and_rust_code/)

[native-android-kotlin-rust](https://gitlab.com/dpezely/native-android-kotlin-rust) is an example project intended to be sufficiently complete for those crossing over from either Rust to Android development or vice-versa.

Although I had been using Rust for a few years, this was my first Android app of any kind whatsoever, learning Kotlin along the way, etc.

How might this code be improved beyond known issues noted in the various READMEs?

Thanks!

PS - There's an equivalent [thread in the Rust sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fywgwj/native_android_app_with_kotlin_and_rust/).
## [7]["Prioritizing the review of apps published, commissioned, or authorized by official government entities" - what does this mean in practice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g1my26/prioritizing_the_review_of_apps_published/)

According to [Google's COVID-19 policy](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/04/google-play-updates-and-information.html):

&gt;At the same time, in order to help ensure we are providing users with accurate and timely information relating to COVID-19, we also are prioritizing the review of apps published, commissioned, or authorized by official government entities and public health organizations.

However can someone elaborate on this? Specifically for financial / banking apps. We **have to be** authorized and approved by government to be a bank so does that count? 

If so what's the process for telling Google this? Is there a form or a box we tick and upload a document or something? Google are less than helpful in their blog post.

Hi. I'm creating an app. My idea is to use just one Activity as the base container for various Fragments. Here are some questions:

- if I want to add a listener on a button placed on a fragment, should I put the onClick method in the Activity or in the Fragment?

- if I declare some variables in the Activity, can I pass them to the Fragments through constructors?

- should I initialize my ViewModel in the Activity or in a Fragment? 

Thank you.

Can anyone here recommend me an up to date tutorial going through the process of getting and sending data from a rest api, caching it locally and presenting it to the user? I assume it would include the technologies mentioned in the title of this post but I'm open to suggestions

Beginner here. I'm having a tough time figuring this one out and my Google searches just keep coming up with adding a shadow to the button OR text but not text that's in a button. 

I'm trying to have yellow text with a black shadow. Am I missing something obvious? Any ideas what I should be looking up? Thanks!
## [11][App reviews and the coronavirus outbreak. Is there a way to tell if my app needs manual review?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g1quwr/app_reviews_and_the_coronavirus_outbreak_is_there/)

Recently our app has been suspended by the play store because it contained the "coronavirus" keyword in the store listing, no mentions of the virus in the app, just the store listing.

We offer a service to avoid queues outside places by obtaining a virtual ticket so the user can go to the place when her turn comes, our government endorsed us because we avoid gatherings, we're offering the service for free for the time being to help population.

The suspension was a misunderstanding and we've been brought back online on the play store in matter of hours, after deleting the "coronavirus" word from the store listing, however, we've rolled an update and, although the google play console communicates a 100% rollout (it was a staged rollout from 20% to 40% and then to 100%), the users aren't able to download the latest version, but just the one before the app suspension.

There's a big popup saying to expect 7 days or more of review time due to the coronavirus outbreak, so I'm starting to think that even if the google play console says so, we've not actually rolled out our update, but are instead in a queue, waiting for manual review and approval, because we might have been somehow "blacklisted" for the previous (erroneous) suspension.

All the other apps we own get released right away, it's just the suspended one that doesn't go live (despite what the google play console says). We've already contacted support to know what's going on, and I'll update with an answer as soon as we receive one, but in the meantime I'd like to know if there is a way to tell if our app, which previously didn't require manual review, is in some sort of manual review list.
