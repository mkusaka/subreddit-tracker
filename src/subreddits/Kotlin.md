I kinda wanna try out some GUI stuff in the JVM world, and TornadoFX sounds really nice (especially the programmatic layouting instead of XML). I don't really want to just do everything with JavaFX, but if that is the better option, I'll do it. I heard that TornadoFX is (allegedly) a bit abandoned, as in that the original developer doesn't work on it anymore and that nobody takes it over. Is this true? And should that worry me? Are there some folks out there that use / have used TornadoFX? What is your recommendation, should I start using it?

Thank you!

PS I'm just doing it for fun, no commercial coding going on here

 I would like to learn kotlin and I'm pretty new to the whole ide thing (though sublime text is more similar to a text editor rather than an ide) so I chose sublime text after trying and failing to use many other ides.
Of course I need to install a kotlin package, no problem, except it doesn't work. At all.

Tl;dr
How do I install a kotlin package for sublime text 3 that let's me run code

Started recently learning java but decided to learn kotlin instead after a bit of time since it looks much less painful, either way, i have a few questions about kotlin that i havent really found the answer to, and i was wondering if there was an active discord server for kotlin with help channels and such, similar to the python one([https://discord.gg/python](https://discord.gg/python)(hope this doesnt count as advertising, if it does i can remove the link)) would be rather useful, ive searched this up a few times and didnt find much, considering theres like 40k subs to this subreddit im surprised someone hasnt made a discord server yet

I recently implemented role-based authorization in our Ktor project, and wrote a blog about its implementation and what we learned about Ktor's internals in the process. Always happy to receive your comments!

Hi you guys, did anyone already read that book called "[Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action)"?  

What did you think one? Did you learned interesting new things about Kotlin? 

Is that book focused on beginner, intermediate or advanced public?
