Considering freelance projects as the only developer, do you think React and his lib ecosystem is better on the maintainability side in the long term ?

Can you confirm that more regular updates is a better approach (less gap) on a smaller lib than on a monolith framework which is more likely to break ? Get back on a previous project should be less painfull for fixing stuff and adding features ?

I'm asking those questions only considering solo dev in a freelance context as i said. Thanks.
