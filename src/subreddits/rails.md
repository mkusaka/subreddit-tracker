I just recently stumbled on Dokku and seems to be a pretty decent way to deploy rails apps. I also noticed that it's been around for a few years now. My Capistrano deployment is running into issues and setting up a box with other installation is tideous. Is Dokku still a viable way to go about deploying Rails apps or is there a better way? I'm a one man shop working side gigs so I'm just looking for the best/fastest way to deploy with having to manually provision vms in DO or EC2. Thanks.

Let's say I want to show only posts for a particular post creation date, which is received from

URL like this (year/month/day): http://localhost:3000/launches/2020/5/24

How do I go about achieving this? 

PS I'm using Rails 6

Hi everyone, 
I have a rails monolith platform that we are now moving to serverless architecture! We are moving a lot of bits and pieces to AWS lambda. 

All our emails and notifications needs translation that are stored in YMl files and some in activerecord backend. 

How is everyone handling translations over serverless architecture? 

Is there a way to kinda Jsonify the translations keys and make them available via API and use them in front end as well without increasing significant load time? 

You  guys are awesome!!
## [6][Concurrent-ruby gem error - corrupted?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/gouu11/concurrentruby_gem_error_corrupted/)

Hi all. I'm having trouble creating a new rails project. When it initially runs bundle install after my rails new command, it gets hung up on the "concurrent-ruby" gem and says there's an error and could be corrupt. I'm not sure how though since it's pulling directly from rubygems.org  unless their latest version (1.1.6) is just messed up? Here's what I get in my terminal: 

`Bundler::GemspecError: Could not read gem at`

`/home/vagrant/.rbenv/versions/2.5.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/cache/concurrent-ruby-1.1.6.gem. It may be corrupted.`

`An error occurred while installing concurrent-ruby (1.1.6), and Bundler cannot continue.`

`Make sure that \`gem install concurrent-ruby -v '1.1.6' --source '`[`https://rubygems.org/'\``](https://rubygems.org/'`) `succeeds before bundling.`

&amp;#x200B;

`In Gemfile:`

  `rails was resolved to` [`5.2.4.3`](https://5.2.4.3)`, which depends on`

`actioncable was resolved to` [`5.2.4.3`](https://5.2.4.3)`, which depends on`

`actionpack was resolved to` [`5.2.4.3`](https://5.2.4.3)`, which depends on`

`actionview was resolved to` [`5.2.4.3`](https://5.2.4.3)`, which depends on`

`rails-dom-testing was resolved to 2.0.3, which depends on`

`activesupport was resolved to` [`5.2.4.3`](https://5.2.4.3)`, which depends on`

`i18n was resolved to 1.8.2, which depends on`

`concurrent-ruby`

&amp;#x200B;

Please help. I've tried to manually run "gem install concurrent-ruby blah blah blah." 

I've also tried manually installing the previous version, and succeeded! But then it still tries to install the latest one that it's having trouble with once it runs its own bundle install again. 

Looking in my rails apps from my boot camp, I'm not even seeing that gem in those Gemfiles. So I'm officially confused, as I should be as a very new developer. Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance.

So i've gone through TheOdinProject a while back and completed the facebook project (its not pretty but it's functional) so I have a basic understanding of rails. However despite being an automation engineer at my web-dev company I want to try to start helping out fixing bugs/etc..

However most things I see are either A. Pretty out of date or B. Go over making a generic "CRUD" site (Which if i've done a facebook app isn't really teaching me much).

I know there is a Udemy Course: "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" by Rob Percival. I've done about half of it (I might finish it, it just felt slow). Is there anything else that would take me to the next level? FWIW it's been a good bit since i've done the Facebook rails app so refreshing and building a solid foundation isn't necessarily a bad thing (to go back over old stuff).

Hell I don't even mind paying for something if it's really worth-while. I have a C.S. degree but it's been about 10 years, and since then i've only done automation programming (Which isn't super in-depth) and small stuff at home. I want to up my game. Thanks!

---
For those who have read the book (others can read wikipedia summary, it is enough for this discussion), what do you think about the 3rd kind of bullshit job : "duct tapers". The example given in the book states that programmers are happy to code open-source projects for free, but paid jobs consist in aggregate those free projects, who are not made to work together. Thus, programmer job is not very interesting because it is just integrating tools, the interesting part is left to "free time hobby".  
For me, Ruby-on-Rails is precisely built against this bias, this is why Rails fans are **both** happy and paid  for their job. Why the majority of the industry accept the "duct tapers" as a mainstream remains a mystery to me.

When deploying using Capistrano, I lose all of my assets stored in Rails Active Storage. An older question on this sub (link below) addressed this, however I'm still experiencing the issue after using the fix. 

My deploy.rb has 'public/uploads'  in `append :linked_dirs` . Whenever I run `cap production deploy`, all of my Active Storage photos are wiped.

As the title shows, I am new to both JSON and GraphQL. Currently I am messing around with the shopify\_api and as such I am using their GraphQL API to gather order data. However, I am a tad bit confused as to how I should be storing this data in my postgres db. I am currently storing requests as t.jsonb :payload

&amp;#x200B;

For the example queries below, my question is which version should I be storing in my database, and why?

      SHOP_NAME_QUERY = client.parse &lt;&lt;-'GRAPHQL'
          {
        shop {
          name
        }
        orders(first: 100) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              name
              createdAt
              shippingAddress {
                address1
                address2
                city
                province
                provinceCode
                zip
              }
            }
          }
        }
        }
      GRAPHQL
    
      result = client.query(SHOP_NAME_QUERY)
      result_data = result.data
      result_shop_name = result.data.shop.name
      result_json = result.data.to_json
      result_as_json = result.data.as_json
    
    
      puts "result:         #{result}"
      puts "result shop:    #{result_shop_name}"

i am trying to do background job for uploading pics ,

the job something like this:

```
  def perform(model, new_image, file)
    model.meta_gallery.attach(
          io: new_image, 
          filename: file.original_filename, 
          content_type:   file.content_type
     )
  end
```

what I got is `ActiveJob::SerializationError (Unsupported argument type: Tempfile):`

I called that job in my controller like this:
```
 params[:gallery][:files].each do |file|
      new_image = helpers.upload_resized_image(file.tempfile, 400, 400)
      UploadJob(@model, new_image, file)
 end

```
I tried to change: file.tempfile.path as well but doesn't work
does anyone has same issue before like this?

I simply cannot get Postgres to play ball on Windows 10, and I need a free hosting option for pitching/testing purposes. I know it's far from ideal, but are there any free hosting services that will accept Rails with Sqlite?
