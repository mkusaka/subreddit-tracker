We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi, I recently just finished building my portfolio and would love some feedback! 

[https://alexteshome.com](https://alexteshome.com)

I drew inspiration from various few other portfolios linked here before. 

I built it with Next.js, with API to deal with the contact form. Also some libraries for some of the scrolling functionality (did not know of an easier way to deal with that, if anyone knows a simpler way?). There might be a few bugs on mobile as well.

Thanks in advance!

Recently I came across a post about [Jira Clone](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone). I found the project helpful and gave me ideas on how real-world apps are structured and how I should go about my future projects. I just wanted to know about other such repos that would be helpful for people to learn from. Any suggestions?
## [6][Using redux-saga with Typescipt [x-post /r/typescript]](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/evgbyv/using_reduxsaga_with_typescipt_xpost_rtypescript/)

I've been using `redux-thunk` for quite a while on a project of mine, but I've recently outgrown it and have turned to other libraries to handle async actions (mostly network requests). Of the options out there, I've found `redux-saga` and `redux-observable` to be the most promising options. After some research, I found that `redux-saga` seemed the best for my use-case. 

I then installed saga and the accompanying types, but I quickly found that saga's integration with TypeScript was less than ideal. For example, using a selector returns an `any` type as opposed to the proper type which corresponds to the output of the selector.

I did some follow-up research on this topic, and from what I can see, saga doesn't support this kind of type safety -- something that `redux-observables` does support. Is there some kind of work-around or alternate `@types` library which allows saga to support real type safety with TypeScript? 

I was excited to use saga, but if proper type checks do not properly work, I will be forced to use `redux-observable`.

Hello huys,

can anyone give me suggestions on how to structure styled components I specifically have in mind the CSS part. I was thinking about how to keep the styling objects separately from the components in a way that its not an overkill. Any tips?

So, I'm working on an App that only uses functional components and hooks.  


I've decided to start without using Redux. I started using only local state, but when the callback drilling started getting out of hand I've created a context for my state and I update it using a reducer (to kind of "emulate" Redux).  


The problem is that whenever I update this context, all the components that are inside the provider get re-rendered. For most of the updates this is fine and doesn't affect UX. However I have a slider component that gets jumpy and slow because for every change, it re-renders every thing, the UX isn't smooth at all for this slider.  


I reckon this problem is the one described here  [https://frontarm.com/james-k-nelson/react-context-performance/](https://frontarm.com/james-k-nelson/react-context-performance/) . But I didn't quite understand the solution proposed.  


For now, my solution was to use local state for rendering the slider with the proper value and debouncing my Context update by half a second. I wonder if is this an ok practice or if there's any reason for me to avoid doing it?   
The context doesn't really need to be up to date right away, it only needs to be up to date when the user submits the form and the user will definitely take more than half a second between this input and the form submit.

  
My other options would be to finally start using Redux, memoize lots of stuff to prevent them from re-rendering when not necessary, try to understand better the solution proposed in the arcticle I linked and implement it.

I like to clone random repositories and use them as a sandbox to test out various new features and try to understand why a bug might be happening. However, all of the ones i have found are todos applications, and I am trying to find some other non-trivial applications I can use. Do you have any suggestion?

Hi! 

I am looking for some kind of open source react course repository, which has tasks, (from beginning to mid level, or something similar) which has the task description, and some *provided testcases* that can evaluate the task itself. 


Are you aware of existence anything similar? 

thank you,
## [12][Wizard/Multistep Form - What are you using?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eve9h7/wizardmultistep_form_what_are_you_using/)

My team about to start a feature that needs a multi-step form in a modal. We have used [React-Stepzilla](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stepzilla) in the past and I didn't strongly dislike it, but we haven't re-assessed in a while either. 

I'm just curious what others are using, especially if you love it or hate it. 

We do not use Redux. We are on React v16.10. We don't have any form tool (probably to our detriment).

Thanks for your time!
