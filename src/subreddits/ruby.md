Ruby seems pretty huge for web development type stuff, but I've also heard of its scripting capabilities applicable to ops and security, which interest me as I've come off knowing some rudimentary programming knowledge in Java and Python, not yet having JS knowledge(HTML/CSS of course). 

Could someone really get a feel for the Ruby language, hence "learning" it to a degree, without stepping much into web development?

Hey guys,

I'm trying to use an API that returns nested json. I'm using json.parse but it is splitting the json file into two large hashes, when I want to go down one or two more levels. Does anyone know how I could do this? Thanks.

As programmers we often have to mentally run code. To imagine how a program will behave given certain inputs. This is hard enough for experienced developers. But for juniors? It can seem impossible. In this article, Melissa Williams argues that pry is an invaluable tool for junior rubyists because it allows them to see exactly what is going on as their code is run.

It bugs me about how long I've manipulated paths as strings without having a failure, but in the last couple of months things have broken in Ruby and Node projects. So I wrote about [the issues I've faced and how we should approach path names to avoid them](https://philna.sh/blog/2020/03/04/mistakes-treating-paths-as-strings/) (TL;DR use the standard lib `Pathname` and `File.join` in Ruby).

Hi everyone,

Can anyone tell me if there's a way to do the following?

    class Animal
      def initialize
      end
    
      def sayhello
        # subclass is cat ? "meow" : "woof"
      end
    end
    
    class Cat &lt; Animal
    end
    
    class Dog &lt; Animal
    end
    
    p Cat.new.sayhello
    =&gt; "meow"
    
    p Dog.new.sayhello
    =&gt; "woof"

Thanks
