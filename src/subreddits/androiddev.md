"Epic Games provided the following statement on Fortnite’s arrival on the Play Store to [*Polygon*](https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/21/21229930/fortnite-available-on-google-play-android-mobile-devices):

After 18 months of operating *Fortnite* on  Android outside of the Google Play Store, we’ve come to a basic  realization:Google puts software downloadable outside of Google Play  at  a disadvantage, through technical and business measures such as  scary,  repetitive security pop-ups for downloaded and updated software,   restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google   public relations characterizing third party software sources as malware,   and new efforts such as Google Play Protect to outright block software   obtained outside the Google Play store.

Because of this, we’ve  launched *Fortnite* for Android on the Google Play Store. We’ll continue to operate the Epic Games App and *Fortnite* outside  of Google Play, too.

We hope that Google will revise its policies and  business  dealings in the near future, so that all developers are free  to reach  and engage in commerce with customers on Android and in the  Play Store  through open services, including payment services, that can  compete on a  level playing field."

I just finished an An Android app as a contractor developer, and as soon as I published the app in Google play and it gaind downloads and users, they removed me from console, refuse to pay and don’t answer me anywhere. 
all I have is the source code, which they don’t have access to. 

going through legal processes can be so long, and probably useless here in my country.

I don’t know, I’m so pissed off, just need to do something about it. 

I was wondering if there’s a way to report this to Google, and they unpublish the app?

What is the Android/iOS dev team size at your company? How many apps does the team own? I feel like 5-7 are enough for an average app. Trying to understand what do bigger teams do?

I have an Android /Kotlin App that reads JSON from: [https://www.androdocs.com/files/uploads/original/sample-json-data-1567767983.txt](https://www.androdocs.com/files/uploads/original/sample-json-data-1567767983.txt)

When I use the exact same app and read from: [http://www.makumaku.de/test.txt](http://www.makumaku.de/test.txt)

it works from Android Studio Emulator. But if I test the apk from my mobile, I can read only from the first txt-file. The second -txt files results in a white screen.

\-&gt; why is that/how can i make the second .txt-file be readable on mobile, too? thx

## [10][App update still processing, 14 days after submission. Anyone else facing this issue ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g5zbko/app_update_still_processing_14_days_after/)

We submitted an update on 9th April and its still processing.

Our app targets minors, so we expect a longer review time, but 14 days is still unacceptable.

Before covid-19, our updates went live, as fast as 4 hours.

Neither we changed anything related to app's target audience, nor did google update any policies in the meantime.

Also according Google's policy, if we submit a new update, while an update is processing, they start the review process all over again.

We are a fast growing startup, and such long review times, the hurt us, as we cannot quickly ship features that users ask for.

Anyone else facing the same issue, or has any tips for us ?
## [11][How to play different audio files for different position in a RecyclerView, please help!](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g5y9ta/how_to_play_different_audio_files_for_different/)

Hi, I've been struggling with one thing for too long that it's delaying my project. I'm fairly new so please be patient with me.

I am making a phrasebook for a certain language and I use RecyclerView to show the list of phrases. Upon clicking every listitem, it should play a local audio recording of the same phrase.

So how do I achieve that? How can I assign different audio files to different positions in a RecyclerView? I'm assuming after setting an OnClickListener to the CardView I'm using, I may have to link it with a folder or class that contains my audio files?

Or please point me to some tutorials.
