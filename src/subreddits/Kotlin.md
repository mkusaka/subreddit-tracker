## [1][Would you recommend Kotlin as a back-end and general purpose language? (In comparison to Go)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/ep1pkd/would_you_recommend_kotlin_as_a_backend_and/)

I've been doing most of my server-side work with Go, and recently got exposed to Kotlin in a native Android project and I really like the language.

I know that one language is generally not the answer to all problems but, in small teams building expertise in one language is a benefit I'm willing to consider.

So the question here is, how's the Kotlin story outside of Android in things like:

* Microservices
* Serverless Functions
* General purpose data processing
* Daemons
* CLIs

Would you recommend writing such applications in Kotlin? And if you have written things like these, how was the experience?

I'm a Java developer and I would like to learn kotlin? Are there any good books about it?   


On the kotlin website they recommend the book  " Kotlin in Action " but it was released in February 2017, so I don't think its up to date.  


Any recommendations?
## [5][Slate Kit: Result&lt;T,E&gt; - Model successes and failures with optional statuses/codes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/eowb1n/slate_kit_resultte_model_successes_and_failures/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/eowb1n/slate_kit_resultte_model_successes_and_failures/

This is the 1st stable 1.0.0 release of the [Slate Kit: Result&lt;T,E&gt;](https://www.slatekit.com/arch/results/) module. This is an approach to error-handling designed as a **variation** of the **Result&lt;T&gt;** component which exists in Kotlin and in other languages, and is a way to accurately model the success or failure of any operation. This implementation differs in some key design choices which are listed in the guide and summarized in the notes below. It is generally available now and also hoping to get some feedback for potential improvements in the future. Thanks!

* **Guide**: [Slate Kit: Result](https://www.slatekit.com/arch/results/)
* **Purpose**: Modeling of successes and failures with optional statuses/codes
* **Install**: [Gradle setup](https://www.slatekit.com/arch/results/#install)
* **Sources**: [slatekit-result](https://github.com/code-helix/slatekit/tree/master/src/lib/kotlin/slatekit-result/src/main/kotlin/slatekit/results)
* **Example**: [Examples\_Result.kt](https://github.com/code-helix/slatekit/blob/master/src/lib/kotlin/slatekit-examples/src/main/kotlin/slatekit/examples/Example_Results.kt)
* **License**: Apache 2.0
* **Upcoming**: Other 1.0.0 versions of modules of Slate Kit will be released in the coming weeks
* **Notes**: This differs from other implementations via:

1. Allowing for a custom error type ( instead of just Exception )
2. Optionally supports sub-categories of Successes / Failures via **Statuses** ( e.g. Denied, Ignored, Invalid )
3. Provides sensible defaults and ways to construct failures via various builders
## [6][Creating a Kotlin project to log GPS data without Google Play Services?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/eovzo1/creating_a_kotlin_project_to_log_gps_data_without/)

Hi all,

I'm a long term python / docker hobyist but I'm in the need of creating a personal GSP logging app for my phone.  I'm using LineageOS for my Android and using a Google Pixel 1.  

I have no Google services installed on the phone and want to build myself my first java app to log this data for my phone. Due to this I came across Kotlin.

In my searches I keep seeing people going to google services to get GPS data.  Without google services, what way would you suggest I do this?  

I want this to eventually end up as open source on the FDroid store, so I want to keep things as free/open as possible.  

Thanks so much

I'm totally new android dev.

I'm using FastAPI (python) for server side. I have generated the kotlin client code using Swagger Codegen (and also tried OpenAPI-generator, doesnt matter). Now what do I do with generated code ? Do I manually copy the files over to my android project ? Or should I take the generated folder as-is and reference it somehow in my android project ? what is the workflow ?

Hello all,

I'd post this only in a jobs channel, but since Kotlin is so nichey, I thought it'd be fine to post this here being the opening is fully remote.  
I'm looking for a fully remote Java developer with exposure or experience in Kotlin. This person really needs at least  years' of experience and it's nice if they've built out platforms in the past, rather than just maintenance. It'll need to be mostly during typical work hours as it'll be with a team of others. Paying $65-$70/hr for 40 hours per week.
