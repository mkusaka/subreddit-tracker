posted this on r/music also a few days back.

this update fixes a lot of the bugs people had reported earlier. It now has support to **skip ads** also. Since many of us are working from home, i find this quite useful while listening to music on youtube during my development time.

&amp;#x200B;

***// \*\* HISTORY \*\* //***

So this is fun project which i made during my free time in early January and then kinda abandoned it. Had a lot of free time these days so decided to update it a release a major version for it!

Here's the chrome extension that i created:  
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-remote/jodpnmokilccncpcgfjpmkhengjhligo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-remote/jodpnmokilccncpcgfjpmkhengjhligo)

Here are some screenshots of the extension running:  
[https://imgur.com/a/FGXfbHt](https://imgur.com/a/FGXfbHt)

This extension allows you control the entire YouTube player on the tab. It has controls like play, pause, skip, seek, volume etc right there! You can also choose to skip ads here. Search tracks directly from this extension and play it on your running youtube tab. Ability to control multiple youtube tabs from here is also present.

\*NOTE\* : You have to have a YouTube tab(s) open with a video playing, which is what this extension will control. This extension is NOT an audio player. It's merely a remote control for your YouTube tabs. I find it useful, since i'm a developer and have music playing in my pinned youtube tabs and can easily control them from anywhere in the browser.

***// \*\* //***

&amp;#x200B;

Go ahead and have a look. I'm open to your opinions and critics :)

Stay safe people!

 So I'm working at a company which due to the current world situation is planning to step into online teaching. The company being in its early stages of growth is not considering hiring any additional developers and has handed over the task to build an Edu website from scratch to me. I'm considering to build the website using **React**, **Laravel**, **Contentful** and AWS. Is this the right tech-stack to go with or can you please suggest me what would work the best?
