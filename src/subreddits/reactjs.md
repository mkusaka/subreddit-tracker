So far, when we needed to access the previous state of one of our state properties, and update it using this.setState in a class component, we used:

**Example 1:**

    this.setState( (prevState) =&gt; { input: value} )

Now I've just seen it written in this way:

**Example 2:**

    this.setState( ( ) =&gt; { input: value} )

Doesn't `()` i.e. the empty parentheses in example 2 effectively say there are no parameters? Or does React implicitly pass in previous state for you when you leave it empty, so you don't have to explicitly type it in your call as per the first example where you do say  `'prevState'`?

Also, should I wrap `{ input: value }` with parentheses? Like this:

    this.setState( ( ) =&gt; ( { input: value} ) )

or is that additonal ( ) optional?

I am hosting my mern app on heroku. But whenever i go to a different route and reload the page, it shows not found. It works perfectly on the localhost. I don't know, it's caused by react or heroku. Does anyone know the solution of this problem?

Somebody nit picked my app and claimed that they can see the password which THEY input on the login page when they open Chrome dev tools and inspect the value of the form field. I'm like, duh, well of course you can, smart ass. I'm wondering is this person has a point, though. Should that be a big deal or not? Is there a way to prevent that from happening? Doesn't really make sense to me, but I'm willing to learn.
## [10][Whats the difference between onchange and onupdate in react? And is there any list of available handlers in react?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jiz2ts/whats_the_difference_between_onchange_and/)

I saw an answer on SO about onInput and onchange and how is it different from html, I was wondering if there is a specific resource for learning handlers on react? And in some opensource projects people use onUpdate handler, but I couldn't find anything regarding onUpdate online. TIA

## [12][(TypeScript) Reset initial redux state via redux-toolkit - configureStore complaining about my rootReducer type](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jiw2g1/typescript_reset_initial_redux_state_via/)

I followed the official redux typescript guide to get started and so far it has worked well: https://redux.js.org/recipes/usage-with-typescript

Now Iâ€™m following this approach to reset a redux store on logout: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35641992/849231

What `rootReducer` return type would satisfy whatever `configureStore` expects? Seems like it should be something generic but I canâ€™t get anything to take
