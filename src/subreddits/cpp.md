Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

 **The next article I'm working on is about technical debt and its multi-scaled impacts.** 

On the current draft, I mention both productivity and psychological impacts.  
If you have any great ideas about how to write about technical debt (and technical debt management strategies), feel free to share your ideas !

I've made [gersemi](https://github.com/BlankSpruce/gersemi) with these two principles in mind:

- it should "just work"
- it shouldn't require much attention from a user

The second principle leads to opinionated style of formatting code. I took some inspiration from how `black` does it for Python and this talk by Kevlin Henney where he mentions a bit about how clear visual form might improve working with the code: [ITT 2016 - Kevlin Henney - Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers](https://youtu.be/ZsHMHukIlJY?t=978). If you are familiar with [cmake_format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format) then it's quite an opposite approach to full configurability provided by cmake_format. Since both project are about formatting CMake code this comparison naturally arises. I'd certainly appreciate some feedback from potential users for this tool and C++ community seems like a good starting point for that.

To try out `gersemi` you need python 3.7+ and just invoke `pip install gersemi`.
