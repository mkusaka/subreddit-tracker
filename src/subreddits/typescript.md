## [2][Arbitrary amount of generics in function call?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h7ivji/arbitrary_amount_of_generics_in_function_call/)

The mysql package allows you to make an SQL query with an arbitrary amount of statements. In my case, I've got a stored procedure with an OUT parameter:

    db.query('call getSalaries(1, 2, @average); select @average)'); // two statements

This would return an array where the first element is a Salary[] and the second element is an array of numbers (the average - though in this particular case, that array would contain a single number). In general, depending on the statements in the query and how many there are, I'm going to have an array of elements of different types, with corresponding length.

I would like to be able to call query in different ways. In general, if I call db.query&lt;A, B, C, ...etc&gt;(myQuery), then I know I'm going to get an array where the first element is A[], the second B[], the third C[], and so on. How would I go about modeling that?

I hope the question is clear. Thanks!

I could not quite come up with a valid use case to justify why typescript supports interface with indexers. plain javascript provides you with indexing objects then why one would need to define an indexer in an interface.?
## [5][How to create a Conditional Type/Typeguard for this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h7dob0/how_to_create_a_conditional_typetypeguard_for_this/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h7dob0/how_to_create_a_conditional_typetypeguard_for_this/
---
So I've got a data structure (`SingleValue`) that I want to be able to handle in 2 different ways. The first is when only one or no instances of it is needed, in which case the variable holding the value should be of type `SingleValue | null`. The other case is when many are needed, in which case the variable holding the value should be of type `SingleValue[]`.

How can I set up a single variable and a typeguard function for a type that is conditionally one of those two types based on a generic type argument.

This is what I have at the moment but it's not quite right:

```ts
type SingleValue = { /* ... */ };

type Value&lt;Multiple extends boolean&gt; = Multiple extends true
  ? SingleValue[]
  : SingleValue | null;

function isMultipleValue&lt;Multiple extends boolean&gt;(
 value: Value&lt;Multiple&gt;
): value is Value&lt;true&gt; {
 return Array.isArray(value);
}
```

The error I get is:

```
A type predicate's type must be assignable to its parameter's type.
  Type 'readonly SingleValue[]' is not assignable to type 'Value&lt;Multiple&gt;'.
```

(this error happens on the 3rd to last line)

Note: I cannot switch to just using an array for the one/none case due to how other parts of my project are set up and the implementation of 3rd party libraries. For the same reason `Multiple` but be a generic type argument.
## [6][How to warn on number to boolean coercion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h7aw3i/how_to_warn_on_number_to_boolean_coercion/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h7aw3i/how_to_warn_on_number_to_boolean_coercion/

Hi, I was wondering if it's possible to get Typescript to warn whenever a possible number is coerced into a boolean. For example:

```
const x: number | null = 5;

if(x) {} // warn

const y = !x //warn
```

The reason for this is that I would like to avoid numbers potentially becoming falsey due to 0.
## [7][Duplication of code for ORMs](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h15lwb/duplication_of_code_for_orms/)

First of all, I am a newcomer to Typescript, and my previous projects involved C# and WPF.

On the C# side of things, I have always used Entity Framework as ORM, which was a mighty powerful ORM. It handled code-first as well as db-first approaches quite easily.

As far as I can tell, there is nothing in Typescript that handles db-first approach. But the bigger problem for me is duplication of code when using ORMs. Entity Framework could easily infer the database schema from the classes only. In Typescript, if I want to define a schema, I will have to do it twice, once as a plain old TS class, and secondly for the ORM. An example of such a code is [here](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/typescript.html).

I have found typegoose to do something akin to Entity Framework when it comes to ORM. TS-Mongoose looked promising until I ran into the issue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h0e3ff/help_with_tsmongoose/).

Has anyone found a less tedious solution for Postgresql too?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Found it. It's TypeORM.

We're trying to build a command line app to find orphan code in a larger typescript project.

Parsing the imports is an issue as they could be multiline.

Is there a parse that can take a .ts or .tsx file and parse out the imports reliably into an AST?

Foal TS framework version 1.9 is officially released!

[Foal TS - June release \(version 1.9\)](https://preview.redd.it/cbw3ao9078451.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1281bba1a03e446043f4cc901173ea9cf6a4016)

This version brings many improvements and fixes bugs.

1. **MongoDB can now be fully used with TypeORM**. The new `fetchMongoDBUser` allows you to retrieve the MongoDB user whether you use sessions or stateless JWTs.

* written in **TypeScript**
* provided **with batteries included** (Auth, OpenAPI, GraphQL, ORM, CLI, scripts, Cloud file storage, etc)
* and with a **simple and intuitive architecture** (no magic, no over-engineering).

And the must: it has more than 11,000 lines of documentation.
