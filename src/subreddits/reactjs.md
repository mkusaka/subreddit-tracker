We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Searched for Todo lists as reference for me to reproduce as a beginner and made my own version of the todoMVC without the React Router.

Hello, everyone.

 I have an idea of quite simple game, not a paradox-like grand strategy, not so complicated, but visually similar - in the center is a world map, like in a Risk game. This map should be divided into regions. They should be clickable just to show information about that region. No 3d. No details. Just flat 2d map. 

Well, could you recommend some resources, which could give a knowledge about making such map? I have no idea how to implement it. Maybe, there are some libraries ready to help with that? I've already searched for some, but did't find something that fits.

I'm still learning the React/NextJS so my question might seem a bit dumb, but here we go. Right now, i have developped a website using NextJS and Contentful. Wonderful stuff, i've learned a lot in the past month and that's a really awesome way to prototype websites fast. But Contentful is not really scalable for what i'm trying to achieve, so i'd like to create a PostgresQL database and connect it to my nextJS application. The thing is i'm not a backend developer, and i'm having trouble to find simple tutorials on how to do this. 

In this database, i'd like to store informations about products and display them on my website. Sounds simple, but for me and my lack of backend knowledge, that's a little bit overwhelming.

My question is the following : how can i create a postgresql database, store informations and retrieve them to display it in my NextJS app? Do you have any tutorials on how to do this? Can i do it without creating an express backend, only using nextjs?

Thanks a lot for your answers guys!
## [11][I wanted to build a personal website, was thinking Gatsby and adding a HeadlessCMS. Any suggestions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/heehhc/i_wanted_to_build_a_personal_website_was_thinking/)

Basically the website I‚Äôve started building up is for a yoga instructor who wants to display information about them and their services they practice. With the possibility of adding a blog later on.

So would be quite simple to put together. I‚Äôve started attached Ghost‚Äôs API to a Gatsby site but I‚Äôm wondering if Ghost is the best option for the type of site? 

I‚Äôve noticed others CMS platforms like Strapi and Sanity which seem pretty cool as well but don‚Äôt want to jump into something else without seeing what others have felt worked for similar projects :)

Any suggestions would be forever grateful!
