Hi everyone!
I would like to start building Android ROMs. I have read about it, however I have a few questions. Please bear with me as I'm still a beginner and would like to learn something new during lockdown.

1) Can I build an Android 10 ROM for a 7 year old Xperia SP(which is the device I have lying around)?

2)I have a slow internet connection, around 10 Mbps. I have read that Android source is around 120 GB. Is it possible to download the source part by part everyday? Just like you can pause download through a download manager, is it possible even on my machine running Kali Linux?

3) Can you suggest some good tutorials to learn from? Currently, I know C, C++, Python and a bit of Java and have experience in using the command line.

4) My machine specs are: Intel Core i5-4440, 16GB RAM, 500GB HDD(dedicated to Linux). Will this be okay to build a ROM in a reasonable amount of time?

I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but can anyone please point to the right one if this is wrong?

I'm still a beginner in java. But I am able to create useful java programs and I really enjoy it. I recently wanted to port these programs to android and I'm finding it really hard.Something as simple as displaying a list seems very complicated.Does it get easier? Are there any tips I need to know or good tutorials/courses I should follow?

Hello there, 
So I have no real experience in programming or coding at all, just finished some intro level courses(cs 50, C intro).
However, I find app development very interesting and want to get Into business.my only option is self learning I can't afford to pay much for now,but I am willing to put effort and time into it.
Should I start by Java then Android studio? Or should I learn using a program that doesn't require coding as (app inventor/React native or unity for games)?
Are both equal in job opportunities (as a freelancer) or which is better?

Sorry if my English is annoying.I'd really appreciate any help.

So i did learn Android Development with Java about a year ago. But I have no idea about architecture and Kotlin etc. I shifted to Flutter for some projects and I really love Flutter, but I wanted to start building native apps again just for the experience. Where should I start with? I'm quite overwhelmed at seeing all the new things such as Jetpack Compose etc.
## [12][How to share data between two fragments? Having trouble with the MVVM architecture](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g8t4jw/how_to_share_data_between_two_fragments_having/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g8t4jw/how_to_share_data_between_two_fragments_having/

Currently I have two fragments, one that shows the weather for a place and another that let's you select a point in a map and redirects you to the other fragment showing the weather for that point.

What I want to achieve is to have by default the user's location and give the option to the user by going to the map of selecting any other place. So I would like to:  
\- Get lat/lng via GPS and then "upload" it to somewhere that would share those values between this fragment and the map fragment (The activity maybe?)  
\- If a point in the map is selected update those values- Both fragments can read at any time, only map fragment can update

I believe I can do this sketchily adding getters/setters to my activity and then in the fragments cast the activity to my particular activity. But this just seems bad. What would be the correct way to do it?

What I have now:  
\- MainActivity (connects both fragments through a bottom navigation bar)  
\- ForecastFragment (Shows the weather for lat/lng)  
\- ForecastViewModel  
\- MapFragment  
\- MapViewModel  
\- WeatherRepository  
\- WeatherAPI (through RetroFit updates values)  
I'm using dagger and kotlin.

Thanks!!
