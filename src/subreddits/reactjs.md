Hi there,

I am new to react and i was wondering how to lazy load my "massive" react bundle after showing just the static landing page (entry point "/" , like login, sign up). 

&amp;#x200B;

basically i want to load the landing page which is just sign up and login forms FAST, before loading the react bundle (including a massive Firebase dependency) while the user is on the landing page.

&amp;#x200B;

how do I split my static landing page from the rest of my app? 

&amp;#x200B;

using create-react-app FYI
## [9][Testing a wrapper component](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hs7iel/testing_a_wrapper_component/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hs7iel/testing_a_wrapper_component/
---
I am using Jest and Enzyme to write tests for my application. I have run into an issue testing a wrapping component that uses a custom hook. I'm a bit unsure if my whole approach is wrong.  


I have the following component:

    ....
    import api from "../api/api"
    import useHttpErrorHandler from "../hooks/httpErrorHandling"
    
    const withErrorHandler = (WrappedComponent) =&gt; {
        return props =&gt; {
            const [error, clearError] = useHttpErrorHandler(api)
    
            const errorDismissed = () =&gt; {
                clearError()
                props.history.push("/")
            }
    
            return (
                &lt;React.Fragment&gt;
                    &lt;WrappedComponent {...props}/&gt;
                    {error ? &lt;Alert variant="danger" dismissible onClose={() =&gt; errorDismissed()}&gt;
                        &lt;Alert.Heading&gt;Oh snap! You got an error while fetching posts!&lt;/Alert.Heading&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Please try again another time. Sorry for the inconvenience 
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/Alert&gt; : null}
                &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;)
        }
    }
    export default withErrorHandler;

and assume I have a &lt;Posts/&gt; component, I am just wrapping it like:

export default *withErrorHandler(Posts)*  


So, I am a bit unsure how to change \[error, clearError\] since it is inside the component. Basically, I want to write a test like:

    const wrapper = shallow(&lt;withErrorHandler/&gt;)
    // change the error value so it is true
    expect(wrapper.contains(&lt;Alert/&gt;)).toEqual(true)

1. How do I change the error value inside the component? 
2. Can I even do this: shallow(&lt;withErrorHandler/&gt;), since it expects a component as an input. Should I do something like shallow(withErrorHandler(&lt;p/&gt;)) \*this throws an error\*

Or am I just tackling the whole situation wrong? Is this more an integration test?

## [11][React Hooks useEffect() dependencies. Not sure if I'm doing this right.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hs4jd5/react_hooks_useeffect_dependencies_not_sure_if_im/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hs4jd5/react_hooks_useeffect_dependencies_not_sure_if_im/

I'm hoping someone can explain where I'm going wrong with React hooks.

I created a reusable `useTimer()` hook (it's essentially state that can trigger events like `onStart()`, `onTick()`, etc.). The idea is that I can add this to any presentational component that needs timer functionality.

What I've written *appears* to work as expected. However, there are a few issues. For example, I put a `console.log('Render!');` statement in the presentation component and it's getting called twice, when I'd expect the component to only render once. Oddly enough, this doesn't seem to be happening when I run the code on codepen (see link below). But outside of codepen, everytime an effect fires, I get:  
*Render!*

*Render!*

The other issue is the multiple eslint warnings in the console, like the following:

&gt;*"React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'duration' and 'onTick'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. If 'onTick' changes too often, find the parent component that defines it and wrap that definition in useCallback"*  
&gt;  
&gt;*"React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'duration', 'elapsed', 'onPause', 'onResume', 'onStart', 'onStop', 'onTimeout', and 'prevStatus'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. If 'onStart' changes too often, find the parent component that defines it and wrap that definition in useCallback"*

This is where my understanding of `useEffect()` and `useCallback()` is lacking. For example, I only want the following code to run when the value of `elapsed` changes:

      // Handle tick event. (i.e. when elapsed is incremented)
      useEffect(() =&gt; {
        if (elapsed &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; isFunction(onTick)) {
          onTick(duration, elapsed); // call onTick function passed in from presentational component
        }
      }, [elapsed]);

If I add `duration` and `onTick` to the list of dependencies, then this code will also trigger when, say, `duration` changes, which is not when I want it to be triggered. Right now it does what I want but I suspect, based on the warnings I'm receiving, that I'm using `useEffect()` incorrectly. I'm also using this approach in a few other places in my useTimer() hook.

I don't understand how `useCallback()` (i.e. creating a memoized function) would be beneficial here, or what other approaches I could take in designing this hook. I've read the official docs and numerous articles and I'm struggling to find an example that handles events in this way.

Below is a codepen with my `useTimer()` code. I've purposely stripped out a lot of the formatting and error-checking and merged everything into a single file for simplicity sake. If you run the timer, you'll see the output in the console. However, in order to see the eslint warnings and duplicate *Rendering!* messages, you'd probably need to run it from a regular command line app.

Any help/feedback is greatly appreciated. If my design is way off, then please let me know. I'm trying to get my head around the React hooks way of building things.

Thanks
