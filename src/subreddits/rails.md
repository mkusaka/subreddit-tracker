Hi Folks,

I have a rails app and I'd like to change the columns from col-6 for sm/md/lg viewing screens to col-12 for mobile. Would this require making custom mixins within a custom.scss file? Thanks in advace!

You know how Heroku has server or app names like "dancing-catfish-12345" or something? Is there a library out there I can use to do the same thing or so I need to come up with that on my own?

TL;DR it seems like the convention for :id is bad for some common use cases, but it also seems like it's a bad idea to go against the convention. What gives?

I'm a complete novice when it comes to Rails, but I've been writing software professionally for 6 years, so not a novice overall.

I used Rails for a college class, and figured why not break it out for a pet project?

I needed to have functionality similar to Google Drive link sharing: secure-ish, non-authenticated resource access.

I figured cool, let's use this SecureRandom module to generate a string I can use as the resource's primary key. I could do link sharing with mywebsite.com/resource/4kUgL2pdQMSCQtjE for example.

After some Googling, I came to the conclusion that this is pretty much impossible / not-recommended / more trouble than it's worth and I should leave the primary key as an auto-increment int.

Okay... so I guess I could use the this string as a property on the model, and then just... also declare it as an index in the migration so lookup is fast?

Gave that a go. And it wasn't great.
* Had to change the routes to use resources :foobar, param: :uuid. What did this actually do? Seems like it just changed the name.
* Set the before_create on the model to generate the SecureRandom. So far so good.
* Overrode the to_param to return the uuid. Okay...
* Now the Foobar.find calls in the controller don't work. Makes sense. Update those to find_by.
* Okay... now the router is doing /1-uuid or /2-uuid instead of just the uuid.

Seems like a huge battle to do something really simple. Is it just expected that the default behavior is leaky routing and you can't easily change it? Am I missing something?

I'm working on an app that lets users create connections with other users, like a Facebook or LinkedIn. When a user clicks a 'connect' button, I want to create the Active Record (Connection), and I want to change the button (to allow the person to 'disconnect' to destroy the Connection) without a page refresh.

I was looking to change the look of the button by changing the visibility attribute to hidden (for the 'connect' button), while setting the visibility of another button ('disconnect') to visible.

I was trying to do this using Stimulus, but it's not working. The record is creating, but page refreshes.  I didn't get to the part where I unhide a button yet.

It's probably a super simple thing for someone who's worked with Stimulus, but it's new to me and I'm no good at JS to boot.

Thanks!

    # the view 
    &lt;div data-controller="connection_button"&gt; 
      &lt;div style="visibility:visible;" data-target="connection_button.hide"&gt; 
        &lt;%= link_to connections_path(referrer_id: user.id), method: :post, remote: true do %&gt;                                     &lt;button class="btn btn-primary" data-action="connection_button#hideConnectButton"&gt; 
            Connect 
          &lt;/button&gt; 
        &lt;% end %&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    
    
    
    # javascript/controllers/connection_button_controller.js 
    import { Controller } from "stimulus" 
    
    export default class extends Controller 
      { static targets = [ "hide"]    
      
      hideConnectButton() 
       { this.showTarget.style.visibility = "hidden"; } 
      } 
    
    
    
    # the controller 
    def create   
      @connection = Connections.create!(user_id: current_user.id) 
      
      if @connection.save     
        redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path) 
      end 
    end

I tried to get rid of the linked\_to to see if just the Stimulus works, and it does not. So I definitely did something wrong (no JS errors in the browser).

`&lt;%= link_to connections_path(referrer_id: user.id), method: :post, remote: true do %&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

I also tried removing the visibility attribute on the div, so it was:

`&lt;div data-target="connection_button.hide"&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

Based on [this article](https://boringrails.com/articles/better-stimulus-controllers/), I also tried changing the data target like this:

    this.contentTarget.classList.connection_button("hidden");

Weird question, I know.

I've inherited an application that runs on Ruby 2.0.0 using Rails 4.x.  It's all old enough that I had to install Ubuntu 14.x just to get a working dev environment.  It's literally running Ubuntu 14.x in production.

Obviously this is a problem and it needs to be updated.  What I'd like to do is update the Ruby first if possible.  That would allow me to install a modern OS that hasn't been End of Life'd and then work on updating the framework from there.

Has anyone else had to deal with this before?  I haven't started digging into the problem just yet, but I'd love to hear people's opinions on the best way to go about this.

In theory I would first update to modern Ruby and then update the framework, but my fear is that I'll end up needing to do both at the same time which will probably effectively turn into a rewrite.

I'm one of my current projects I have an table with around 30 thousand rows, I've realized however that the index of said table takes some time to render, upwards of five seconds. While debugging and stripping the controller of every logic possible I was left with an request time of around 3\~3.5 seconds, which was still weird.  


At this time, all I had on my controller was:  


    class RecordController &lt; ApplicationController
      def index
        records = Records.all.page(params[:page] || 1).per(params[:per] ||  10)
        render json: records
      end
    end

Using kaminari pagination, I was rendering only 10 instances of Record. My serializer looked like this:

    class RecordSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer
      type 'engine-records'
      attributes :id 
    end

Then I realized that no matter how many Records I got through pagination, from 1 to 100, the response time was still the same. I only managed to get it lower by removing the serializer file.

By removing my RecordSerializer I've managed to get an response time of 150ms with 100 records per page. To me this seem absurd, almost 3 seconds of performance overhead caused by such an basic serializer. I can't find any posts online on the subject, and this seems too absurd to be "expected behaviour", anyone got any idea what might be causing this? Is there some sort of configuration that I might have missed or anything like that? Dropping the serializer is not an actual potion since I have to render Record and it's relationships on that endpoint, so I need the serializer, but I'd like to avoid those extra three seconds if possible

If I git pull a project that has the \`bundle\_gems\` path inside of, say, \`vendor\`, is it still necessary to run \`bundle install\`.  

I'm actually working on a docker image â similar question: Do I need to run \` bundle install\` if I COPY in the project files inc the gems?

Pre-Rails 6, when you generated a controller you would generate an associated `.coffee` file for the view that would contain your client side javascript for that particular controller. E.g.

```
app/assets/javascript/post.coffee
```

With the move to webpack as the new default, we have `app/javascript/packs`. So what is the new convention (if any?). Packs themselves are just ES6 modules but does it make sense to have per controller `packs`?:
```
# app/javascript/packs/post.js
func myPostFormFunc() { 
//.. 
console.log("included!")
} 

// app/javascript/packs/application.js
require('./post)
```
Then in whichever view you need the client side code you include it via `javascript_pack_include`?

e.g. 
```
# app/views/posts/index.html.erb
&lt;%= javascript_pack_include 'post' %&gt;
#... index code
```

This seems a bit redundant if I have to include it each time I want to use the per `pack` code. Or instead, is javascript logic is intended to be "thoughtfully" organized into ES6 modules (e.g. `packs/form_logic.js`) and then required?

Just looking for guidance on the latest convention here.

Hi Folks,

I'm building an online store and as part of it I'm working on a cart icon that will update with the count of the number of items in a cart (similar to what amazon has). My question is how can I leverage a variable I define at the controller level (ex: @number_of_cart_items) to dynamically display in a header layout/view. I'm thinking it will require custom css, but not quite sure how it would be done though I think scss might be an option. Any comments are appreciated.
