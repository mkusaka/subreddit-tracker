Hello!

I am working on an Android app using Kotlin and Android Studio as a final project for my Mobile Computing Applications class. It‚Äôs not too difficult of an app, but I‚Äôm having trouble getting started with the coding part of it. I wanted to see if you guys could point me on the right track as to what to look up, research, videos to watch, etc. 

The idea of the app is that it is sort of a reverse sign language app. Instead of you looking for the word, and it showing you the sign, you punch in the qualities of the sign and it shows you possible words it could be. Here are the screenshots of the two layout files we have.

The app would function as this: the user presses the qualities of the sign using the spinners and radio buttons, and clicks submit. Behind the scenes there is a database of signs, with those qualities, and a picture. It would find which one matches with the qualities the user submitted, and then show the picture and sign name on the final screen. The screen would then have an ‚ÄúAgain‚Äù button, that would go back to the selection screen, clear the user‚Äôs first selections, and let them start over.

I‚Äôve talked to my teacher about this and we‚Äôve used databases in one of our labs, but we never created one, it was just given to us. It was something like Room I believe? 

Also, what should I be looking into to wire that submit button to work correctly?

I come to this subreddit not to see if you would do anything for me, but just to see if you guys can point me in the right direction. A sort of ‚Äúhey look this up it should help you out‚Äù kind of thing.

Let me know if you have any advice, or further questions.

Thanks!

I see a some protobuf files in kotlin repository, but I am curious to know what is it used for. It seems like its related to Intermediate Representation(IR). Does anyone knows? Why?

I have an android app with several gradle modules. Some of them are pure kotlin modules and I want to reuse these to build a desktop client.  

What can I do? Do you have some useful resources to learn? I'm going crazy because I have a very superficial knowledge of how Gradle works and for my android app all the hard work is done by Android Studio.
## [6][OpenJDK14 + JavaFX14 + Kotlin + IntelliJ + TornadoFX plugin ... possible?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gc4ztw/openjdk14_javafx14_kotlin_intellij_tornadofx/)

The latest Java version seems to be 14. Since I want to create a new project, I have no reason not to use the latest version. TornadoFX's Github main page says it does not support Java 9/10. But JDK 8 seems very old. According to Google search, the support seemed to end in 2020 (or unclear after 2020).

I downloaded and setup OpenJDK14 and JavaFX14. I could successfully run the [HelloFX sample](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx). Now, of course, I want to use an IDE.

 Q1: According to [this post](https://medium.com/@hinchman_amanda/tornadofx-migrating-jdk-8-to-open-jdk-11-a711290259ac), the author claims that TornadoFX  works with JDK11, even though the official GitHub says no. Does it mean that it can work with JDK14? I tried to follow it, but I got all sorts of compile errors for the default template TornadoFX project that I did not edit.

 Q2: If the answer to Q1 is no, since I could run HelloFX in the command line, and I could run a simple Kotlin project in IntelliJ with JDK14, doesn't it mean that at least "OpenJDK14 + JavaFX14 + Kotlin + IntelliJ" works? How more difficult is to use JavaFX in Kotlin without TornadoFX? Is the difference like using pure Win32 to create a GUI application vs using MFC?

What are some good book/courses for Kotlin? Can be free or paid.

I've done 1 python college course so I know some general stuff (classes, loops, methods, functions)

Want to get into app development

So there's a good chance that this is just way outside of anything I could ever actually do, but I'm wondering how I'd go about modifying the grammar for the Kotlin language. Not for any particular purpose - just to learn.

Like, let's say I'd like to change the language such that instead of having a `data` keyword we instead have a `hippos` keyword that does the same thing (i.e. makes a class with equality/hashcode/toString/component etc etc overrides).

What would that process be like?

Edit: To be clear, I'm specifically talking about modifying the _compiler_, re-compiling and then compiling my hippos-tastic code. I'm not looking for a way to do it within the current confines of the language, I'm more wondering about it as an introduction to tinkering with the compiler. Like, in some source file somewhere there must be some logic that looks something like "If keyword == "data" emit this bytecode" or whatever.
