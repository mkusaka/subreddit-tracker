Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

## [4][[APP SUSPENSION] Meme Generator Free - Violation of Violence policy, No example, No warning, Editors' choice app, 4.7 average rating, +30mil downloads](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fagk5j/app_suspension_meme_generator_free_violation_of/)

\[RESOLVED\]\[UPDATE\]: The suspension appeal was successful and Meme Generator Free is back up on the market after a review. No additional explanation was given, but we assume it was just a really bad error.  
We might have overreacted, but as we've seen very similar horror stories from other developers, we felt like this had to be shared. An app Suspension is a very drastic and disproportionate measure for an error or misunderstanding. We hope this part of Google Play will be improved in the future.  
We're also thankful that Google Play's team took care of this issue in less than 8 hours after suspension. We hope similar future situations can be avoided by a friendly email.  
A huge Thank you to the entire Android Developer community, your support means a lot to us!

Hi!

Some might know our app Meme Generator Free which was suspended about one hour ago without warning and without any example of violation. The message only says: Issue: "Violation of Violence policy - We don't allow apps that depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities." We don't know if it's a  meme, sticker, an example or anything else. We did not receive any other explanation so we do not know how to make our app compliant if it ever gets reinstated.

Our app was an Editors' choice app, released in September 2011, had +30 million downloads, and an average user rating of 4.7. We are all shocked by this swift suspension, and by the lack of any examples or further suggestions on how to make our app compliant. We read a lot of similar posts in this subreddit and were honestly scared it would eventually happen to us as well. We are a company that employs 5 people, Meme Generator is our main app and we love co-creating the Android app space. We'd be very disappointed and sad to shut down our company because of an error.

We have sent an appeal, but we since we read similar horror stories on this subreddit, we're doubtful we're resolve anything trough a regular appeal. At this moment I'd be happy to speak to someone at Google's app review team so that person can tell us how to make our app compliant. We can only achieve this with some public support from our users and fellow developers. We will also share this post on Twitter and tag GooglePlayDev.

If anyone has any recommendation on what else to do, we'd be very thankful.

ZomboDroid Team

EDIT: This happened an hour after pushing an update to our Beta testing group. What is also interesting is that the PRO version went through the review process and got accepted, but the Free one gets suspended. They are the same apps, one Free and the other paid.

## [6][Make sure you add mediation to your apps, THEY can flip the switch on your account!](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fau20a/make_sure_you_add_mediation_to_your_apps_they_can/)

Mediation saved me when they flipped the switch on my account which made my CPC drop to $0.05-$0.06 from $0.2-$0.3 (almost 60% app users are from USA).

12th October is the exact date some bot flipped the switch on my account, no suspension, no warnings, invalid activity cuts never went above 5%, fill rate always 90%+ but revenue dropped like crazy (They still give me 95%+ fill rate so ads aren't limited) .

Those numbers are tiny, so you should probably zoom.

Here are my before and after pics.

Immediately after this happened, I switched off Admob through MoPub, and gave complete traffic to FAN. Do you know FAN provides real human support and that they reply to you within 5-6 hours of you sending them an email? And just in case you're wondering, the revenue never picked up on Admob and there's nobody I can email/contact.

Use mediation, stay safe.

The APi is [hackernews](https://github.com/HackerNews/API),they recommend using a Firebase Android Client app. Was this possible to do a few years back or am I blind?

Unless I missed something in the dev console, I did not find a way to specify a different link for the privacy policy for each country. Is that possible or are you supposed to handle all languages in that unique link ?
