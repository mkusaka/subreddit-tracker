basically the tittle, I'm learning ruby and see a lot of people use (+var+) but isn't #{var} a lot easier? is there situations where you'd need to use a specific one or is it just preference?

thank you :)

Hi there, I'm just trying to automate a process. We use a command line tool which is navigated by keystrokes (no mouse). 

I was hoping to create a ruby script to send the required keystrokes to that tool, and am asking for your help on how to do that basic thing. 

It's easy enough to start the program; `system 'programName'`, but after that the script is hung until you exit the program. 

I suspect the answer is something like 'create a new thread and send the keys' but I'm not sure how to do that. 

thanks for any help you can provide

I was thinking about making a headless watir build to scrape everything they've got and join it with current kbb data, but I thought to maybe ask here first if someone hasn't already done this or similar or know of a resource I'm not considering.
