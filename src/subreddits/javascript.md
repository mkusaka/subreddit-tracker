Hey, everyone! Thank you in advance to those who will read and write their thoughts on the next question.

So the question itself, "Why is it important to update the project's dependencies?"

I update them quite often, about once a week. And my colleagues are very strongly against it, I think they just don't know why it is necessary, so I would like to know what you think and educate them.

I’m kinda new and want to follow a nice structure for my future projects.

I’m mainly using NodeJS/express for backend and currently working on a project using Angular
