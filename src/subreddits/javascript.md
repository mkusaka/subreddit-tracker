*excuse my english french man from Quebec

**A)** If you install the latest VSCode for doing WebDev on Linux and you disable the telemetry in it will you still have somekind of telemetry inside your linux system à la Windows 10 ?

**B)** What's your opinion about being a 100% remote JS dev today in 2020 is it feasible to have a solid well paid career being remote also I am trying to go back to programming after 20 years.. ( did some C++ etc not starting from 0 ) some ppl told me I could be junior-intermediate inside 2 years if I study 10 hrs a day what I want to know is should I aim to be fullstack cause some programmer told me to specialize frontend or backend and not try to be fullstack in 2020 is this true ?

**C)** What's the IDE or text editor after VScode to do solid webdev ? like the 2nd best is it close to VSCode or it's the best now with the greatest extensions and workflow ? (sublime atom another etc)
