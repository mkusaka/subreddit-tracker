Hi! I love emacs, but the deeper I go into react programming, the harder it gets to use. No indentation or syntax highlighting for GraphQL and Styled Components, web-mode constantly loses syntax highlighting and must be reloaded, unhelpful quotes being added for me where they shouldn't be.

I tried VSCode and it has so many slick and convenient features, but feels way slower and more sluggish than emacs, I don't want to switch, I'm still more productive in emacs despite all the issues.

Did anyone manage to create a good emacs config that works well for react webdev? Can you please share?

(I did post this question on /r/emacs, stackoverflow, and emacs stackexchange, but received no helpful replies so far, so I'm hoping maybe you guys could help?)
