Today my friend sends me a link to this post: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html). I am intrigued by the visual design and the interaction of this post. Is there any Javascript framework allow me to do that. A tutorial would be helpful too. Thanks
## [8][[AskJS] What are these "default keys that might collide with your own" that Object allegedly has, and Map allegedly doesn't?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/fopty6/askjs_what_are_these_default_keys_that_might/)

I tried to look into Maps, and they look just great. Like super Objects without all the bloat and fluff. But I don't trust them. What is a "map" compared to an "object" use case scenario (since they say that objects have been traditionally used as maps. So there has to be a difference)?.


Also, There is a big problem here..



https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map



The site claims how super epic Maps are and not a single bad thing about them is mentioned, but just reading it you see some inconsisentencies:

&gt; An Object has a prototype, so it contains default keys that could collide with your own keys if you're not careful.  

Implying that a Map doesn't have a prototype, yet 2 lines lower ,there is an extensive list of default methods and properties which the Map has.


So yea.. can I get the truth about Map, because this is pretty one-sided and fishy... When I turn my objects into a json stringify, I don't have any keys there that I didn't put. If I make a new object and alert new_object[length], I get undefined, as I should. Because the key doesnt' exist. So which are these secret keys that exist in Object and not in Map, which can make a mess for me and in which scenarios?
