[go-app](https://github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app) is a package to build progressive web apps with Go and WebAssembly.

Version 7 was released today, it now supports generating a static site, which can then be deployed on github pages.

I used this to build a web interface for [astextract](https://github.com/lu4p/astextract):  https://lu4p.github.io/astextract/

It was really easy (took only a few hours).

Since Go Team does not have yet full answer for the problem of versioning tools written in Go, we wrote a small open-source CLI tool that makes it easy and is built on Go Modules: [https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo](https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo)   


You can read about it more here: [https://www.bwplotka.dev/2020/bingo/](https://www.bwplotka.dev/2020/bingo/)

Feel free to check it out, give us feedback and contribute!  It's open-source so we can improve it together! (:
