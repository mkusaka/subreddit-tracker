## [5][How should I type a function, which takes a function as an argument and returns a new function with the identical type.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ggy2q6/how_should_i_type_a_function_which_takes_a/)

Hey  there, I wonder if some typescript wiz can help me with this. I'm  writing a React hook basically which takes a function as its first  argument:

`type Callback&lt;T&gt; = (args: T) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;`

It then returns an array containing an object, and a new function which takes the same args

`type ReturnType&lt;T&gt; = [State, (args: T) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;]`

I'm then combining them for my main function definition:

`function myFunction&lt;T&gt;(cb: Callback&lt;T&gt;): ReturnType&lt;T&gt; { ... }`

Now,  this works fine for functions which take arguments. However I also want  it to work for functions which take no arguments, i.e.

`() =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;`

Currently it returns me the type:

`(args: unknown) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;`

which doesnt match. Any help would be amazing!! &lt;3

Any one interested to work on developing polymorphism feature for TypeORM?

[https://github.com/pirate-lp/typeorm-polymorphism](https://github.com/pirate-lp/typeorm-polymorphism)

**Background**

I understand that we can hack our way around it and that there is no plan from original maintainer to develop the feature, but I really miss this functionality in the Node.JS community and as far as I searched, there is no functional library that supports this design. Even bookshelf.js runs into a lot of bugs and issues when it comes to working with polymorphic relationships!

**UPDATED: Solved using intersection instead of union**

I'm building the write-side of a CQRS from scratch for the purpose of learning, and what I am trying to type is the command handlers. Just to be clear, I really don't want an array of function pointers, I'm just speaking in a comfortable, an ancient tongue.  In JS, I would

    const handlers = {
      FooCreated: (payload) =&gt; { ...foo created handler },
      BarAssigned: (payload) =&gt; { ..bar assigned handler },
    }
    ...
    const handler = handlers[body.command];

I am seeking a TS solution with the fewest keystroke touches on the text "FooCreated", et. al.  I'll have hundreds of commands (and events, which will probably face the same issue).  What I have so far:

    type CommandMeta = {
      userId: string;
    };
    type Command =
      | {
          CreateFoo: {
            meta: CommandMeta;
            payload: {
              id: string;
              name: string;
              baz?: string;
            };
          };
        }
      | {
          AssignBar: {
            meta: CommandMeta;
            payload: { 
              id: string; 
              fizzbang: string; 
            };
          };
        };
    type CommandHandlers = {
      [C in keyof Command]: (meta: CommandMeta, payload: Command[C]) =&gt; Promise&lt;any&gt;
    };
    const handlers: CommandHandlers = {
      CreateFoo: (meta, payload) =&gt; {
        // meta &amp; payload is "any", I would like it to be typeof CommandMeta &amp; payload type for CreateFoo
      },
      // No complaint about missing "AssignBar" handler
    };

As noted in the commends in the command handler implementation, I am getting "any's' for the meta and payload parameters.  Furthermore, I am not getting any error for missing the "AssignBar" handler, and I can also put any old garbage name in there.

I'm not married to the above approach, so any quick boosts would be appreciated.  I'm not a big fan of spreading types across hundreds of files and typing (via keyboard, not TS) their names in lots and lots of places.  So I put a premium on an implementation that is less clean than most prefer.

Say I have a Movie type:

    interface Movie {
      title: string;
      year: number;
      studio: string;
      actors: string[];
      writers: string[];
    }
    
    const m: Movie = {
      title: "Silence of the Lambs",
      year: 1991,
      studio: "Strong Heart",
      actors: ["Jodie Foster", "Anthony Hopkins", "Ted Levine"],
      writers: ["Ted Tally"],
    };

and there are a few properties I want to iterate over, like

    for (let jobName of ["actors", "writers"]) {
      m[jobName].forEach(console.log);
    }

I can't do this unless I add  `[index: string]: string[] | string | number` to my interface and then assert `m[jobName] as string`, but then I can use *any* string to index in, and I don't want that.

In this case I could just do

    m.actors.forEach(console.log);
    m.writers.forEach(console.log);

but what if I'm not iterating over just two properties, what if I'm iterating over 50 and don't want pages and pages of manually specified iterations? This isn't exactly a real problem I'm having but I'd like to know what the correct response to this problem would be, because it's definitely something where I feel like I don't know the smart path.
