Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j9l01t/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

I had a breakthrough: On a side project at work (CTF scenario) my first reflex was, "I know how I'd write this in Rust." 

Historically, this has been, "I know how I'd script this in Ruby" when I want to whip up some quick-and-dirty, throw-away code.

I've been playing in Rust long enough for it to become comfortable and even my preferred tool.

Hi,

I just got back to programming and knows not much at all about Rust for sure. Yet, I'm really excited about trying to actually improve my programming skills and my math skills. And why I think it's unique? Because I want to try doing stuff from scratch, I feel most open source code I find about math/scientific stuff it's so library dependent, full of optimizations that makes the math SO UNCLEAR. I want to create a BOTTOM-UP approach, and create a clear library of correct, very-precise math implementations from scratch. Like you will solve a problem in an applied math class in 2nd year of university, or in a 2nd year physics/physical chemistry/pick your favorite class. First, am I somewhat too ambitious? And who wants to help, because I can multiply matrices, integrate stuff on paper but SURELY will get lost in translation to Rust code. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. : I wanted to explain that I chose Rust for this project because:

1. It's fast- I think it's ridiculous to multiply matrices in a slow language.
2. It's not extremely strict like Haskell (I feel I'll have a slight headache and abandon the project- so sorry I really wanted to like it, only my personal feel right now). But it's strict enough.
3. It feels like the kind of thing you could really use everywhere, like C code(maybe I'm wrong\*)
