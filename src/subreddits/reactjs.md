## [5][Is it safe to mutate destructured state variable?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jazc53/is_it_safe_to_mutate_destructured_state_variable/)

Golden rule of React is not to mutate a state variable directly.

However, if I destructure the state, can I then update this variable safely? For example;

    this.state = {
      arr: [{id: 1}]
    }
    
    fooBar = () =&gt; {
      const { arr } = this.state;
      arr.push({id: 2});
      this.setState({ arr });
    }

Or should I clone this array and work on it?

    fooBar = () =&gt; {
      const { arr } = this.state;
      const clonedArr = [...arr];
      clonedArr.push({id: 2});
      this.setState({ arr: clonedArr });
    }

Hello everyone, I have an idea for my last year college project in react. I want to build a real time mobile chat application. Its about 2 years that I am learning front end development and all my focus was on Javascript and I think now I am in intermediate level. Is it really hard and complex to build such application using react?

and what other technologies should I use I searched and found that I can use firebase or sokcet..

what database and server side programming language should I use, can I use node.js for server side and mangodb for database?

I'm using React Router v6 and using the navigate API and passing minus 1 with the intention of returning to the previous page. [This page](https://pastebin.com/19CbQrY4) is landed upon when when an error occurs during an API request. When I'm on this page and try to go back to the previous one, it takes 4 clicks to do that. What could be the reason for this?

I've read that you always code JS in useEffect, but I've seen other people code it differently. So confused about it, would like some clarity!

## [10][Bind an method in the constructor function](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jayxd9/bind_an_method_in_the_constructor_function/)

Hi fellows !  
I took some vacations to go for an online React course at [codeacademy.com](https://codeacademy.com) .  
I have a question:  
Why do you need to bind, in the constructor function, a method to the object itself, when that method uses the *this* keyword?  
If the method is from a different class component instance, I understand why:  
When that happens, the *this* would refer to the instance and not the the source class component, that's why its needed to bind the method to the source class component.

But, if the method is from the same class component why do I need that *this* refers to the object itself?  


I hope my text was not confusing.  


Thanks a lot
## [11][How to save,edit and update user profile information in Reactjs with Nodejs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jayw0w/how_to_saveedit_and_update_user_profile/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jayw0w/how_to_saveedit_and_update_user_profile/
---
 This is the user profile page: [User Page](https://codesandbox.io/s/gifted-varahamihira-dbhco?file=/src/UserInfo.js)

I would like as soon as a user registers all fields are "readOnly",  then the user clicks the "Edit" button and the fields become editable.  While the fields are editable, the "Edit" button changes to "Save". Once  the user has filled out the form, he clicks on "Save", the data is sent  to the database and becomes visible in "readOnly". Once the data has been saved, from the second "Edit" onwards the "Save"  button will have to update without creating new elements in the  database.

First time: Edit--&gt;Input Data--&gt; Save   
 From second time: Edit--&gt;Change Data--&gt;Update

I know maybe it's a bit too much but I can't solve it myself. The back-end side works, but obviously every time I send the data a new line is created in the table.
