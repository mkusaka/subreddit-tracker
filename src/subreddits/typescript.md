I got annoyed that I kept forgetting to compile my TS before pushing. So I made a GitHub action to compile it for me and make another commit if I ever forget to compile it. I'm posting a link to the action here if you guys ever need that failsafe in the background for anything.

## [4][Is there a way to convert dynamic array to static type assertion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/g1txjl/is_there_a_way_to_convert_dynamic_array_to_static/)

is there a way to dynamically generate a const assertion in typescript ?

I know you can create a `readonlyArray` assertion based on a staticly typed array, eg.

     const staticTyped = [1, 2, 3] as const // readonly [1, 2, 3]
     type TypeStatic = typeof staticTyped[number] // 1 | 2 | 3
    

Now that works as expected and elegantly. However, I need to create a large readonly array that's generated dynamically.

    const generateNumRange = (from: number, to: number): number[] =&gt; {
      const arr = []
      for (let i = from; i &lt;= to; i++) {
         arr.push(i)
      }
      return arr
    }
    
    const dynamicTyped = [...generateNumRange(0, 255)] as const // readonly number[]
    type TypeDynamic = typeof dynamicTyped[number] // number (oof)

Now I do understand where the issue lies, however I can't think of a way, that would allow me to return the `dyanmicTyped` as `[0, 1, 2, ..., 255]` rather than `number[]`.

Is there any way to do this / perhaps even more elegant solution to the problem altogether?

I have some strings that form a query in my project, and I can check those strings for validity at run-time when they're being used.

It would be nice to catch any errors in the query strings at compile time. Is there a way I can hook into the compiler so that something I write is run when I execute `tsc`? If I can emit errors along with line information that would be helpful.

If anyone has any resources on creating something like this that would be awesome.

Hi everyone, I'm playing a bit with `reflect-metatada` but something that's annoying me a lot is all the `any's` that are in the type definitions. For example:

    const value = Reflect.getMetadata('key', Object)

How do we know `key` is a valid metadata key? And `value` would be any, what if it could be also `undefined`?

I'm not saying that TypeScript should be automatically able to infer which `keys` and `values` are valid metadata in `Object` (even tho that'd be great) but at least, I think we should be able to do something like:

    interface UserMetadata {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    }
    
    const name = Reflect.getMetadata&lt;UserMetadata&gt;('name', Object);  // name is recognized as a valid key and is a string
    const age = Reflect.getMetadata&lt;UserMetadata&gt;('age', Object);  // age is recognized as a valid key an is a number
    const firstName = Reflect.getMetadata&lt;UserMetadata&gt;('firstName', Object);  // It complains because firstName is not a a valid key

Or am I missing something and this is possible? So far, I tried to improve the default typings for `getMetadata` but even tho I got the `key` validation part right, it's still returning `any`.

    function getMetadata&lt;T, K extends keyof T = keyof T&gt;(metadataKey: K, target: Object): T[K];

What do you think?

Having not felt like I've settled on an approach I like yet, I'm curious how other people organize their projects in regard to their type definitions.

Edit: by 'global' I meant more like 'common' or 'shared' or whatever. Bad Ben, Bad!

I recently wanted to make sure that an array of strings contained all the strings of a string union.

I found a simple way, but when attempting to generalize the pattern, I came across some behaviour I cannot explain. Perhaps someone has an idea? (disclaimer: I may be missing something obvious)

&amp;#x200B;

    type UnionEquality&lt;A, B&gt; = A extends B ? (B extends A ? true : never) : never;
    type Foo = UnionEquality&lt;"foo" | "bar", "foo"&gt;; // true
    type Foo2 = "foo" extends "foo" | "bar" ? ("foo" | "bar" extends "foo" ? true : never) : never; // never

I'd expect \`Foo\` and \`Foo2\` to evaluate to the same type (`never`), since one is just an expansion of the other.
