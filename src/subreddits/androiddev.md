This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I'm an Android developer with about 2 years of experience. I have recently started writing tests for our app. I started with the Unit test for the Repository layer and the ViewModel layer, which I felt was very straight forward. However, when writing the Espresso test, I realized that our community lacks documentation and samples for writing Espresso test. I am finding it difficult to understand what is Espresso tests supposed to test.

Eg: When we write a unit test, we test the view model or repository in isolation by mocking all the dependencies. But when Writing Espresso test, am I only supposed to test the UI layer (Fragments) by mocking view models? Or do I test the UI Layer (Fragments) and View Model by mocking the Repository layer? Or do I test the app as a whole by giving different inputs and validating the UI for the output?

Hi dev community,

I create apps since Android 1.4 (HTC G1 was so cool back then :) ) and even had one success (it earned, with almost no marketing, around 15K$).

Now, for the first time, together with my friend, I've created a mobile game ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grandegarbanzos.scratchme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grandegarbanzos.scratchme))... and I have no idea how to let people know it exists :/.

We  spend a week positioning it under a search term "scratch quiz" in  Google Play (it is now at first position) but as it turns our nobody  uses this search term (what in hindsight it's that surprising...).

We plan to buy some mobile ads even if we're not convinced it brings "real" users to the game.

Do  you have any advises for us? Regardless if it is about game marketing  or the game itself, any word of advice (positive or negative) will be  much appreciated.

Cheers!

p.s. Please accept my apologies if this is not a right place for such questions.

Hello guys,

I'm developing an app to collect data from my job's vehicles refuel. The responsable for refuel the vehicles will input how much liters he refueled, the car ID, driver's name and some other information. The problem is: the app need to show only one input window per time, that contains an EditText for input, a "next" and a "previous" button, to navigate between the screens.

How is the best way to handle it? Create a new activity for each layout or change the layouts when the "next" and "previous" buttons are clicked?

Thanks in advance!

Hello,  I'm trying to creae popup windows for Android using Kotlin, but it appears in diferent position on phones with different DPI. My phone is 480 DPI, virtual phone is 560 DPI.

`val dm = DisplayMetrics()getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(dm)`

`var screenAdjust:Float = (dm.densityDpi / 160f)`

`var x:Int = (116f * screenAdjust).toInt()debugText.text=x.toString()window.showAtLocation(changeTextSize, Gravity.CENTER_HORIZONTAL or Gravity.BOTTOM, 0, x)`

If both coordinates are the same it also works wrong.
