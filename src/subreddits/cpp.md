**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

When another user asked the logic purpose of unions, many answers where given and then someone asked if GCC/Clang/MSVC documented the type-punning behaviour to be defined.

I wanted to answer him/her, but couldn't find anything.

Now, my curiosity wants to know if it's possible to find what's defined or not at the compiler level.

I understand that if I don't want surprises, I need to rely on the ISO C++ Standard, but I suppose that some people rely on techniques like type-punning that are UB at the language level, but defined at the compiler level.

So, do you know if this documentation exists?

If yes, would you so kind to share it?

&amp;#x200B;

This library is created for routing HTTP requests to callbacks. It's designed to be generic (the callback signature can be chosen by the user), so that it's not limited to a single HTTP implementation.

Callbacks can be either free- or member functions. If the path contains slugs (embedded regular expressions), the matched data can be provided to the given callback.

It's still in early stages, there are probably more features to be added, there's some more optimizations to be done, a lot of documentation to be written and the unit tests are very basic. I still wanted to share it to see what people think and if anybody has any suggestions (whether they like it or not).

Why would you ever want to use unions, does anyhone have any practical scenarios where unions were the best solution? ðŸ¤”
