Hey folks, a month or two ago I asked myself, "what would it look like if I wanted to get GraphQL-like queries and resolvers in pure TypeScript?" I started hacking away and today I published the proof of concept under the title TypedQL. It allows you to define a graph query API and write queries against it. The real hero here is TypeScript Language Services, as seen in this [gif](https://imgur.com/fcUrI58).

Check it out [here](https://github.com/gregoryfabry/TypedQL); the README has some examples that show what the library can do. This is very much a proof of concept and there's definitely some black magic in the typings, but it can be downloaded and experimented with. I would love to hear your feedback, as I definitely think the concept has value and might be worth pursuing further.
## [4][typescript-eslint no implicit any rule?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f1hayp/typescripteslint_no_implicit_any_rule/)

Hi does anyone know of an [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) rule to disallow implicit any?

I know there is a rule to disallow *explicit* any, but I am wondering if there is a rule for disallowing implicit any?

Example:

    // instead of this:
    let s;
    
    // I want to force the use of a type here.. like this:
    let s: string;
    
    // disallowing explicit any solves this:
    let s: any;
    
    // but not this:
    let s;

Thank you!!

So I come from the Java world and I'm having some difficulty with Typescript's `infer` keyword. I'm playing around trying to infer the generic types of a nested data structure, but I can't seem to make the types line up, and I was hoping someone could show me the error of my ways. 

     type Tuple&lt;T&gt; = [Foo&lt;T&gt;, Bar&lt;T&gt;]
     type Tuples&lt;...&gt; = ReadonlyArray&lt;Tuple&lt;?&gt;&gt;

     const tuples = [ // inferred as Tuples&lt;string | number&gt; 
       ['one', 'two'], // inferred Tuple&lt;string&gt;
       [3, 4] // inferred Tuple&lt;number&gt;
     ]

This works fine if i specify the types explicitly, but I'm sure there's got to be a way to infer them.

I've tried searching, and I find various generators and such that will generate Typescript files from C#, but is there anything that does it the other way around? I.e. something that can generate C# types from Typescript? ðŸ¤”

Hello Everyone,

I have created a small library that is designed to transform data using a deduction map, this map contains an array of deductions, each deduction will use one or more values from the source and apply a list of transforms before storing it in the output at the given path.

&amp;#x200B;

Really interested in feedback and suggestions on how to improve the idea.

Thanks
