We’ll be joined by other developers and team leads from Kotlin, as well as two special guests: Wojtek Kaliciński /u/wkalicinski from Google and Sebastien Deleuze /u/sdeleuze from Spring.

On October 12–15 we hosted the Kotlin 1.4 Online Event, and over the course of those four days we received many interesting questions. Since we did not manage to cover all of them due to time constraints, we will answer them in a specific thread under this post.

Please post your questions as top-level comments to this post.

We look forward to hearing from you!

I am a CS graduate and I have experience with C++, C#.NET and Python. But I have never worked with Java.

I want to learn Kotlin from the ground-up, and not just learn it quickly and without depth.

I REALLY want to know how everything works and how each piece fits in the language. My goal is to become an Android Developer, but after learning Kotlin first.

Are there any resources you would recommend to me? I really prefer resources with plenty of exercies, videos are okay only if they contain exercises as well, and no, *think of something, and build it* is not much of a help, because I have no practical problems that I can currently solve with plain Kotlin on the commandline.
## [4][Koin automatic injection](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jkuhap/koin_automatic_injection/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jkuhap/koin_automatic_injection/
---
Libraries like Guice or Dagger allow you to inject a dependency, if all of this dependency dependencies are satisfied (through your module definition).

This comes in handy to avoid having huge module definitions and also you can inject classes without dependencies without adding them to the module definition.

Any idea on how to do this on Koin or Kodein?

## [6][Suggestion: an option to add automatic reversals for boolean functions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jkuowv/suggestion_an_option_to_add_automatic_reversals/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jkuowv/suggestion_an_option_to_add_automatic_reversals/
---
So a way to set an option that will create opposite functions for boolean functions, just like it creates getters and setters.  
For example:

`class Foo {`  
`...`  
`fun isEmpty() = this.amountOfBar == 0`  
`fun isBig() = this.amountOfBar &gt; 0`  
`}`  
It'll then automatically generate these functions:  
`@Kotlin.internal.InlineOnly inline fun Foo.isNotEmpty() = !this.isEmpty()`  
`@Kotlin.internal.InlineOnly inline fun Foo.isNotBig() = !this.isBig()`  
Which will inline on compilation. This will make coding more fluent, so no need to go to the back of the function call to add a `!`.

Hey yall! 

So, i'm a self taught junior iOS developer. I've been learning in the academy of YouTube for for 6 months before i got my first job 3 months ago ( a grand total of 9 months, MASSIVE!)

So, i know there's still a lot for me to learn about iOS, but - at the company i work for right now there aren't any android developers, so the head of development is forced to work as an Android dev. 

That's where i try to come in ! I want to learn Kotlin in order for me to be able to work on our app from both platforms, and have a wider set of skill. 

From what i've seen so far the differences between Swift and Kotlin aren't massive, so i was wondering, is there anyone else here who is an iOS developer as well? If so, how did you go about adapting to Kotlin? What are some good sources to learn for someone with a bit of history? for iOS there's hacking with swift and Angela Yu, are there any equivalencies in Kotlin? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

Is there such method or any with other name which supports wrong type as parameter or something not a JSON object as an argument so that it causes result to be null?

 Drizly is looking for an Android Developer to join our small team (currently a team of 4) to help with our Kotlin Migration. So roughly the work would roughly entail and revolve around large rewrites, feature pushing, reworking some of the technical debt (thats in java) as well as fine tuning some rewrites as well.  


Also, we are a start up, its a small mobile team, so if you wanted to branch out to our RoR backend api integrations or even to the swift and iOS side of things, we are happy for someone to go down those paths!  


So all in all, we are pretty flexible on alot, besides the fact the coding test will be done in kotlin.  


If you are interested in hearing more about it, feel free to email me. (also please redact any information when you do apply, and if you reach out to me to schedule a call, dont worry we have another way to move you through while trying to remove implicit bias!)  


This role is also a full time remote role, though applicants do have to be based in the US (its a finance thing).  


[kenneth.han@drizly.com](mailto:kenneth.han@drizly.com) or just [apply](https://jobs.lever.co/drizly/22d7f3b6-181d-43df-a9f5-acfc9383db6c?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=reddit)!
