Today I was learning how to use Nokogiri from the book instant Nokogiri. Somewhere along the line, the author mentioned that dependency management is good as a programmer especially for ruby. And then went on ahead to explain how to create the gem file and include required gems on there for bundler later on. I am still learning about programming in ruby and I realised that there may be a lot more general practices that are good but I have no knowledge of. 

What are some of the good practices you have seenor learned in your line of work that you think should be done by everyone ?

Regardless of the existence of unit/integration/component tests that are focused on a single Microservice, are you also testing multiple Microservices together?   


1. How exactly - everything, group of Microservice, which evn, from the front or backend only?
2. Is this stable or flaky? In my experience these tests are failing quite often, trying to understand whether I should improve anything

Some rubyists (myself included) have noticed an issue pasting from the clipboard into latest version of IRB (Ruby 2.7)

[https://github.com/ruby/irb/issues/43](https://github.com/ruby/irb/issues/43)

Is this universal, or dependant on environment (OS / shell / dependencies / etc...)

Does anyone NOT experience this issue?

Paste the following into IRB. Slow or instantaneous?

    my_hash = {
      'id1' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id2' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id3' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id4' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id5' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id6' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id7' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id8' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id10' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id11' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id12' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id13' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id14' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id15' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id16' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id17' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id18' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id19' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' },
      'id20' =&gt; { a: 'foo', b: 'bar' }
    }
