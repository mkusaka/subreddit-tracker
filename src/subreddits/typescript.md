    firebase. firestore. Query &lt; T &gt;
    A Query refers to a Query which you can read or listen to. You can also construct refined Query objects by adding filters and ordering.

I think .where() should return firebase.firestore.Query based on the above. Can someone tell me why this is not the case or what else may be causing the type error below?

    import {DocumentTarget, RecordTypes, WhereDefinition} from "../../../shared";
    import admin, {firestore} from "firebase-admin";
    import firebase from "firebase";
    
    export default class FirestoreConnection {
      public async getSome(collection: string, whereClauses: WhereDefinition[], limit: number, orderBy: string, offset: number): Promise&lt;object|boolean&gt; {
    // TS2741: Property 'limitToLast' is missing in type 'FirebaseFirestore.Query' but required in type 'firebase.firestore.Query'.  index.d.ts(8156, 5): 'limitToLast' is declared here.

## [4][Tool to detect unused class methods?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/etvbdz/tool_to_detect_unused_class_methods/)

Hi,I recently discovered `ts-prune`, a tool which detects a subset of deadcode by highlighting any exports that are not used anywhere in the project. This information was a slightly useful to me on my current project, but unfortunately this tool did not highlight unused class methods.

Example:
```
    // src/Foo.ts
    export default class Foo{
        counter: number = 0;
        public incrCounter(){
            this.counter++
        }
        public printCounter(){
            //dead code
            console.log(`The counter is ${counter}`)    
        }
    }
    export function alsoDead(){
        //also dead code
        console.log("Fish")
    }
```
```
    // src/index.ts
    import Foo from './Foo'
    const foo = new Foo();
    foo.incrCounter();
    console.log(foo.counter)
```

In this case `ts-prune` would detect that the exported function `alsoDead` is not used anywhere in the project. However, it would not detect that the method printCounter is never used.

I am vaguely aware that using OOP-flavoured programming with typescript is not fully recommended (?), so I wouldn't be entirely surprised if there was no existing tool that helped solve this problem. 

And if worst comes to worst, I suppose I can resort to deleting each class member in turn and seeing if it fails to compile!!

I think these type should be equal:

    { a: string | undefined }
    { a: string } | { a: undefined }

These mean same set of values. And if these are equals, the following works:

    Exclude&lt;{ a: string | undefined }, { a: string }&gt;   // =&gt; { a: undefined }

But it don't work as I expected. Because `{ a: string | undefined }` is not `{ a: string } | { a: undefined }`.

If it works, Exclude&lt;A, B&gt; could be considered as subtraction of set in mathematical context. I think there is big deals if these types are equals. Why not? And please tell me related GitHub issues if you know. Thanks!

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little confused as to why the compiler is letting me get away with the following code. I would normally be expecting a noImplicitAny error inside of the catch param. Please note, this is also happening for the 'then' block - I have just chosen to manually type it.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand on a basic level that's it to do with the return type of request, and that typescript is doing some inference under the covers, but could someone explain why in this case you wouldn't be forced to explicitly type it? Could you explain on a deeper level what is happening? How do I fix this? What other scenarios does this happen in?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using the axios types inside of their index.d.ts module, so there doesn't appear to be a nice way to get around this. This is obviously a problem in a shared codebase. As you can see in the 'catch' block, I can basically do anything I want at compile time. Obviously at runtime, the response.couldLiterallyHaveAnything here obviously won't exist - and IMO should be something I can pick up at compile time (if you were forced to type it).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Code snippet:

    import axios, { AxiosError, AxiosRequestConfig, AxiosResponse } from 'axios';
    
    export const APIService = {
      getAll: async () =&gt; {
        const requestConfig: AxiosRequestConfig = {
          method: 'get',
          url: `someUrl`,
        };
    
        //Why is the compiler letting me have untyped/implicit anys as shown in catch block
    
        return axios
          .request(requestConfig)
          .catch((response) =&gt; Promise.reject(response.couldLiterallyHaveAnythingHere))
          .then((response: AxiosResponse) =&gt; response.data.result);
      },
    };

I Tried to use nodemon for auto restart server on changes but  Typescript throws the following error even though extended the type.  Please find the code attached below.

Typings work fine with VS Code but the errors while compiling by nodemon. Error attached below code. 

index.ts

    import * as fastify from 'fastify'; 
    import { Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from "http"; 
    const server: FastifyInstance&lt;Server, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse&gt; = fastify(); server.ready(err =&gt; { if (err) throw err;     server.swagger(); }); 
    const start = async () =&gt; { 
        try { 
            await server.listen(3000, "0.0.0.0");         
            server.log.info("Server running on 3000");         
            console.log("Server running on 3000"); 
        } catch (error) {         
            server.log.error(error); 
        }

Hey!

I just ported my react-native project to typescript and have a question about functions as props

im passing:

`&lt;DisplayCardsWithLikesdata={testData}likes={500}`**onPress={() =&gt; this.props.navigation.navigate("CardDetailScreen")}**`/&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

to

`type Props = {onPress: Function}`

&amp;#x200B;

`const FloatingActionButtonSimple = (props:Props) =&gt; {const {onPress} = propsreturn (&lt;View style={styles.containerFab}&gt;&lt;TouchableOpacity style={styles.fab} onPress={onPress}&gt;&lt;Icon name="plus" size={16} color={"white"} /&gt;&lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;&lt;/View&gt;);};`

&amp;#x200B;

So nothing crazy, but if i define onPress as a function it doesn't work. Does anybody of you have an idea on how to define onPress?

Thanks a lot!

So I have variables declared and everything, and I want to add it to a printed string. I want to have something like "Your X plants have been watered", and X is a variable rather than a string. I know I would have print("Your X plants have been watered") if I wanted it to say X, but how do I make it so its a numeric variable?

On the GitHub the last commit was almost 2 years ago, does it work well?
Also does it work fine with both pg and pg-promise?
