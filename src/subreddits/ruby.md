Not a regular Ruby user.  I'm trying to use bundle install to test out an application that I'm interested in self hosting.  I've gotten through most of the major pitfalls...but cannot figure out how to get the bundle to install libv8 successfully.

I was able to build the correct libv8 (7.3.492.27.1) by pulling the source from git and locally building the gem.  But the application's bundle keeps trying to Install it by pulling and compiling itself (the arch doesn't have a rubygems prebuilt?), and it keeps failing.  Is there a way to nudge it towards the locally built gem?

Thanks!

How often do you think about the bits -- the ones and zeroes -- that make up your app's data? If you're doing web development in Ruby there's rarely any need to. But what if you want to interact with the operating system or a piece of hardware? What if you'd like to understand network protocols or databases? In that case, a solid understanding of bitwise operators is foundational. 

In this article Jos√© M. Gilgado will introduce you to bitwise operations in Ruby, give practical examples of how they can be useful, and finish big with with some fun math tricks.

I've been a Ruby developer for four years, and feel like I'm not as good as I should be.

For example a recruiter asked me if I used XXX (don't remember the word). It was just a fancy word for blocks, but I didn't know the word and it was one of the main reason I wasn't hired (or so he told me).

Most things I've read online is for new developpers, not really to improve as an already pretty experienced dev, do you have any places to recommend?

## [10][How to create rake task for importing javascript libraries](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/fgjuph/how_to_create_rake_task_for_importing_javascript/)

I started using ruby on rails with its 5.2 version and since the newest rails version(not correlated) was released I haven't been coding that much in rails/ruby. I got used to using asset pipeline for importing javascript or css libraries. And then the switch to webpacker happened, which in my opinion hasn't made things much simpler. Long story short, I went through few tutorials for implementing bootstrap into rails project and I thought it could be nice to have a rake task for importing javascript libraries. 

I fell in love with rails because it frees you from great amount of "manual" labor and gives you time to spend energy on being creative. 

So basically I'd like to perform automatic installation of bootstrap into rails project with the command like this: 

`rake bootstrap:install`

I've came up with an idea that this task should do this

1. `system("yarn install bootstrap")` \- to install javascript dependency
2. create file app/javascript/stylesheets/application.scss
   1. fill it with this text "`@import '~bootstrap';`"
3. append to app/javascript/packs/applications.js text below:

* `require("bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap")`
* `require("stylesheets/application")`

I'd like to get some opinions about this, is there something wrong with my approach, what's the best way to do it etc.
