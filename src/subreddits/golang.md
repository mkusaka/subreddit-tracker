In the past, I used to write Laravel applications and fell in love with Laravel Forge for its ease of use and how it is compatible with the big cloud platforms. Is there something similar for Go? If so, I would love to use it. If not, is it something you would be interested in? It would be Go specific. Because I would also love to build something

Hi!

I never got Gorm working correctly. As soon as association are in the game, it just does not.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's imagine I have a "Sound" struct and it has a Category. When I AutoMigrate, the field Category is simply ommited. If I add a CategoryID and set it's reference tag to it, it generates the CategoryID and set it to 0 only.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I'm missing ? Because that's litterally the example from the "Has One" section from Gorm's documentation...

(By the way, once I get this working, I'd like to have something like a InversedBy in doctrine, is that possible ? It doesn't seem to according to the docs)

## [9][Is it a good idea to write an in-memory database in go instead of rust?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/j6069o/is_it_a_good_idea_to_write_an_inmemory_database/)

So i am working on an in-memory database, I am very familiar with go and I'm learning rust. So far I am not feeling like I would want to work with rust, maybe because I'm still not comfortable with it. So my question is it a good idea to write an in-memory database in Go given that it has a GC?

I was using a simple implementation of a worker pool (something along the lines of https://gobyexample.com/worker-pools). Switching to a worker pool lib (like ants, workerpool, pond etc.) made my app faster. 

In simple terms can someone explain whats the trick they use so that we need these kind of libs?
