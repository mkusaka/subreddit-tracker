We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I saw Chakra-UI, Theme-UI, Rebass, Ant Design, Priceline one, Semantic UI, Carbon, Microsoft Fluent, Google Material, Reakit, Gestalt and others, including Tailwind CSS.. The list is endless, but how do you choose between them? Most of them follow the same structure AND have the same components (Box, Flex, Card, Spinner, etc) with the same custom attributes (p={2}, mr={2}, etc) but some changes, like css={} or sx={}.

\[Personally\] I'm using React, Typescript and Emotion. I just want an easier way to deal with flexbox/css, I spent one afternoon trying to make it work for a relatively complex responsive layout, without success. I only need a few of these components, so it doesn't make a difference, all libs have them.

\[As a good Reddit user\] I also hope to help anyone having the same question in the future, so feel free to say anything, even if it doesn't fit in my specific scenario.

I'm making a new site, and I had to choose between Gatsby and Nextjs. I came to the conclusion that, while Gatsby is great, Nextjs is more popular, and more used by "the community", so I thought it would be best. I also thought SSR would have an advantage over Gatsby when serving dynamic content.

However.. in the updated Nextjs docs, it says you should use static rendering whenever possible.. and then it made me wonder why I don't just use Gatsby from the start.

Even though Gatsby is static, you can still make regular React async api calls from within components, so what's the issue with dynamic in Gatsby?

My Chrome (latest stable Chrome on Ubuntu 19.10, i5 cpu, 16gb RAM) browser keeps coming up with the "Page unresponsive" dialog box, asking if I wish to exit, or wait for the page to become responsive.

Formik is pretty damn popular, so I'm thinking something is wrong on my end. If not, something is wrong with the tutorial, with Formik, or with CodeSandbox (all unlikely, I know).

[https://codesandbox.io/s/formik-v2-tutorial-final-bq0li](https://codesandbox.io/s/formik-v2-tutorial-final-bq0li) is the link for the "Final Result," as it appears on this page: [https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/tutorial](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/tutorial)

Anyone that checks this out is greatly appreciated. An answer as to what the cause is, or where the problem lies is even more appreciated!

Thanks in advance redditors! :)

Hi everyone,  
I'm a web developer and I recently learned good bases for using ReactJS. I did from the past some games using C and CSFML library at school, and I wanted to know if ReactJS can be good techno to create games (I'm of course not talking about 3D FPS or something like that, more old school game-oriented 2D or a simulation of a 3D).  
And I also want to know if it will be hard to transfer the ReactJS game to React Native to make usable on the phone?  
Did not yet learn React Native so don't know.  
Thanks!
