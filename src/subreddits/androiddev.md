## [4][Anyone experienced this lately? I am an indie developer and have a game with 500k+ downloads, it has a stable 2-3k downloads/day.

Okay simple question, I'm planning making an app and I am debating with myself whether I should make it OS or not. If I make an app now, why should anybody review it, except people doing it to expose it in whatever way? If nobody looks at my source code, except people who are trying to figure out how to get userbased data for exmple, how can open source be more secure? 

I understand that something big is reviewed a lot and it makes sense that it's open source, I just don't think anyone with good things in mind would ever bother looking at my source code, because: why? 

So I'd like to get some opinions on what you think about this and what I should do. Thanks a lot

Greetings to the AndroidDev community üñê,

I've been using AdMob for over a year now, but in March 2020, I got this sudden issue. This means that I get around 3-10% match rate for my ads at best, meaning that pretty much none of my ads work. I went through all the Google Forums and saw hundreds that has this issue, but the only solution Google provides is an unhelpful "Continue to develop your app and hope for the best!".

All of my ad traffic has been organic, I tried to reset my ad IDs etc. but nothing seems to work. Is there anyone else that had this issue, and I would be greatful if I can get a more definitive and logical solution other than what is already provided to us by Google.

Hi. I'm following this super article about developing an android application without android-studio + gradle:

[https://medium.com/@authmane512/how-to-build-an-apk-from-command-line-without-ide-7260e1e22676](https://medium.com/@authmane512/how-to-build-an-apk-from-command-line-without-ide-7260e1e22676)  


Everything's fine, except one little problem.  
If i want to compile my application against an .aar library, what should i do?  


In article, writer said that we can compile jar libraries with our application like this:  
`./dx --dex --output=$PROJ/bin/classes.dex $PROJ/*.jar $PROJ/obj`

But it won't works for .aar libraries.

Hello, I'm having an issue with this design, for some reason the list appears over the top of the screen instead of being matching parent as it should be with the constraint layout. Any clue?

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;`  
`&lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"`  
 `xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"`  
 `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`  
 `android:layout_width="match_parent"`  
 `android:layout_height="match_parent"`  
 `android:background="@drawable/background_default"`  
 `app:layout_behavior="android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout$ScrollingViewBehavior"&gt;`  
`&lt;androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView`  
 `android:id="@+id/rutasList"`  
 `android:layout_width="0dp"`  
 `android:layout_height="0dp"`

 `app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"`  
 `app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" /&gt;`
