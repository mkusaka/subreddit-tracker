Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely (permanently, or for the duration of the pandemic)? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I wrote a BrainFuck compiler in c++ metaprogramming, At compile-time running the BrainFuck code and generating "hello world!" string, later printing it at runtime. ðŸ˜€

```cpp
puts( R"(
&gt;++++++++[&lt;+++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.
&gt;&gt;++++++++++[&lt;++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;+.
&gt;&gt;+++++++++[&lt;++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.
&gt;&gt;+++++++++[&lt;++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.
&gt;&gt;++++++++++[&lt;+++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;+.
&gt;&gt;++++[&lt;++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.
&gt;&gt;+++++++++++[&lt;++++++++&gt;-]&lt;-.
&gt;&gt;++++++++++[&lt;+++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;+.
&gt;&gt;++++++++++[&lt;++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;------.
&gt;&gt;+++++++++[&lt;++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.
&gt;&gt;++++++++++[&lt;++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.
&gt;&gt;++++++[&lt;++++++&gt;-]&lt;---.
)"_brain_fuck );
```
