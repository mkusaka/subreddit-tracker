I had typed array with an object with one optional field. Then I decided that instead of an optional prop what I really want is an array of objects not containing that property or all the elements containing such property, so I switched to a sum type.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that this makes destructuring of such prop impossible.

Here is an example of the sum type:

&amp;#x200B;

```js

type tab&lt;T&gt; =

| { label: string }

| { label: string, value: T }

```



This is what I can not do:


```
    tabs.map(({ label, badge, value }, idx) =&gt; {

        callSomeFun(value || idx)

    })
```


This works for flow, but not for typescript:


```
    tabs.map(({ label, badge, ...tab }, idx) =&gt; {

        const value = tab.value || idx

        callSomeFun(value)

    })
```


Also because of this, some other parts of the code get an inferred type of mixed, which in runtime is not correct because I'm just "or-ing" them:



const \[activeTab, setActiveTab\] = useState(tabs\[0\].value || initialTab)



activeTab becomes of mixed type



Is there a better way of doing this while ensuring the type safety of having the prop on all items or no one?

I wonder if anyone knows if it is possible to send arguments to getServersideProps in Next Js.

At the end of my URL I have a hard codded page number, that fetches different movies per page, but I want to have it dynamic with getServersideProps, is it possible?


export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (
  ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext&lt;ParsedUrlQuery&gt;
) =&gt; {
  console.log(ctx.query)
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=${process.env.API_KEY}&amp;language=en-US&amp;page=1`
  )

  const data = await response.json()

  return {
    props: {
      data: data.results,
    },
  }
}

I've been packaging all my modules lately with ES2015 as the target.

Is there any reason to even think about ES5 anymore?

I mean we're all moving WASM now anyway right? :P

## [11][When are parenthesis not redundant?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/gmhh6c/when_are_parenthesis_not_redundant/)

Context: I'm working on adding intersection types + parenthesis support to [typecheck.macro](https://github.com/vedantroy/typecheck.macro).

It seems like parenthesis are redundant in most cases. Examples:

(A | B)\[\] = Array&lt;A | B&gt;

(A) = A

(A | B) | (C &amp; D) = A | B | C &amp; D because Typescript implicitly does parenthesize for you

It seems like the only place parenthesis affect the order of "type operations" is:

A &amp; (B | C ) =  A &amp; B | A &amp; C. 

Can someone correct me if I am wrong?
