Hi, I'm about to start a project that involves managing files on devices such as my Android phone and my computer. I know I need to use something on the JVM and I'm trying to decide between just Java, Scala and kotlin, but if a different language would definitely be better than those feel free to suggest it. I know this is a Kotlin page but if possible please try to be unbiased. 

Thanks in advance.

Hi! I've started to learn the Kotlin language two weeks ago because I want to develop my first app. At first, I jumped right into coding a login start screen and include Firebase, but I don't understand some things and it became frustrating. After that, I've considered that it's best to start with the basics and try to structure the info in lessons. Usually, the best learning method for me is to take a quiz/test after finishing a "lesson". Can you recomend websites or apps where I can do this?
