We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey guys I recently deployed my app on AWS for the first time. It is a poll making app which you can share, add a time limit, and even take a screenshot of the results.  It's more of a portfolio piece than anything so I'd really appreciate it if you guys could check it out and give me some feedback!

Good day. I'm new to ReactJS and torn between using Redux or Hooks + Context. I already used both. so I want to extend my knowledge. But I need your suggestion which should I choose between this two. I need to select only one.  Thanks

I know there are a lot of tutorials, but I want to choose right from the beginning and know which way to go.

I want to create a simple page that retrieves data from 4 different api and then processes that data on the page (in live time but not only).

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, how to approach it in the most optimal way?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I create my own REST API ? or Should I first save the api data using e.g. lamda every 30 minutes to update it or should I do it on the fly?

&amp;#x200B;

Which databases should I choose and do I need them ? Or maybe I can use graph ql ablo elasticsearch ?

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer to ask because I know that there are a lot of solutions and tools and I wonder what you think. Why do you do something wrong if you can do it well and efficiently ?

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe I think completely wrong and do it differently?

I'm a bit familiar with React but want to do a refresher. I'm looking for a comprehensive course (Udemy or others, don't care about the platform) that's good an up to date. The thing is, I want it to be focused on Hooks and on Context instead of Redux from the start. I'm seeing a lot of course in where Hooks are only and add on in the end and that's it.  


Which ones do you recommend?

I am about to start my first development position and I will be building desktop applications that will pull data from external api.

I have absolute free will to choose the technologies that I want to use so I decided to use Electron plus React cause I have solid foundations in JavaScript and I enjoy learning React...

Can you suggest some articles on how to combine these two? Maybe tutorial series? I know already how to fetch data from API and what I am looking for is more like development setup, process, building and publishing application built with React and Electron, sending updates to app etc...

Any advice is greatly appreciated!
