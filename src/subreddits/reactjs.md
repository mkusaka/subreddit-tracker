Hey everyone ! I need some help from you guys. Currently I am working on project. And have used [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/) in it. Somehow I need to implement the admin dashboard on a specific route namely [website.com/admin](https://website.com/admin). And also the login route uses the [website.com/login](https://website.com/login) but I need that route for logging in my users and I want the admin login to be [website.com/admin/login](https://website.com/admin/login)  Tried many possible ways from my side and couldn't figure out how to do it ! Can anyone help me to implement it ?

P.S : I am using [react-admin-firebase](https://github.com/benwinding/react-admin-firebase/) as my data provider

Hi there, I'm a little confused when reading about this topic so maybe someone can shed some light on it for me. Most of the examples of class components in the React Docs use a constructor to set the state, bind event handlers and assign any other value to `this`. But I've also noted that you don't need to bind methods if you use arrow functions, and that object properties (including state) can be assigned directly on the class. I was reading about uncontrolled components and the example in the docs goes something like this:  


    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        this.input = React.createRef();
      }

but I've noticed that I can also just do this:

    input = React.createRef();
    handleSubmit = () =&gt; {/*...do a thing...*/};

No constructor needed. Which seems to work just fine. Is there any reason why this is bad practice? And why is it not mentioned in the docs?
## [12][How can I force some elements to be placed into the DOM before rendering child nodes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jqo92m/how_can_i_force_some_elements_to_be_placed_into/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jqo92m/how_can_i_force_some_elements_to_be_placed_into/

I have a legacy API that needs to use querySelector and then it writes to that element  (pdf.js).  

The problem I need to make sure the container has been rendered to the DOM before I attempt to use a child component.

I think I can do this by only rendering the child when the ref callback is defined right? 

That seems like it would do it!
