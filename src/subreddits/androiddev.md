Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

## [4][Completed the creation of a game in the genre of a transport tycoon. I made the game alone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hsvih2/completed_the_creation_of_a_game_in_the_genre_of/)

 How nice it was when I was able to make my own game. Made the game alone  (code and graphics) without buying assets or anything else, only I used  music under the CC 3.0 license.

In the game you will be engaged in  freight transportation: raw materials, materials and goods. Raw  materials must be delivered to factories for processing into materials  and goods. Goods can be sold in cities (where the price depends on the  number of imported goods) or sent for export (to a port or railway  station). Enterprises themselves can be improved, as well as cities in  which raw materials and materials need to be imported for improvement  (improving cities also gives bonuses for pre-crippled plants). In  cities, you can build bonus buildings that will give various bonuses.  Also in the game there is a special big city "megapolis" which you will  build yourself.

In the game, you  can execute contracts to transport resources and tasks from the list,  which are more complex but give more reward.

Trucks  in the game can also be improved and changed to specialized trucks that  can carry only one type of goods but do it more efficiently. Trucks  have fuel that ends over time and must be sent to a gas station. There  is also a special "personal truck," which improves for the experience  gained from medals that are issued for fulfilling achievements.

For  example, I can show what parameters affect, for example, the production  of goods. Basic production speed, improvement at the factory, bonus  from the laboratory, bonuses from the quarterly newspaper, bonuses from  cards, bonus from improvement of the city to which the factory is  attached, bonus of 25% from activation of the temporary bonus, bonuses  from buildings that can be built in cities, quantity of electricity or  adjustment of power consumption at the plant.

Hi guys!  


I work with android for 5 years and it is the only technology that I ever worked on profissionally. In my career, I always focused on software engineering and architecture and I never really liked the UI part of the job. Because of that, even that I know how to write layouts and have a understanding of how android works, sometimes I feel like I'm missing some deep knowledge on the Android framework, specially on the UI, but not limited to it.  


I'd like to some advice for what you guys think that I should study and some recommendations for topics / articles. Looking at the internet, It's really hard to find articles for more advanced stuff, I feel like we have several tutorials teaching how to do some specific thing, than articles explain how things work or other cool things that it's important to know and we don't really focus on a daily basis when our job is just to delivery features (for example: gradle, dependencies resolution, code generation, or other cool things that I don't know and I can't quote).  


Thank you all!

Do you guys know a design app that can export a project easily to android studio ?

i've seen Invision and Sketch but i don't think they can export project directly on android studio.

I just had an update rejected as it contained "much much more" which apparently triggered the reject.

My app won't harm any website and only extracts information that is open in that website.
