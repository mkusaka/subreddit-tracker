Hello everyone,

I have been a software developer for a few years now and have programmed in Java, C, C++, Python, a bit of Haskell (not a fan). So I am fairly experienced with programming but I have not written a single line of JS in my entire life (I don't even completely understand what the DOM is). I am moving jobs, however, and my future position requires familiarity with JavaScript. And from what I understand, Javascript is the most volatile language out there with books written a couple of years ago not completely reflecting the current state of JS. So can anyone please recommend me a good book that is still relevant with the current JS (libraries, features, tool-chains, paradigms ...etc)

Thanks in advance
