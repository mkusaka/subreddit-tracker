Hello mates, I spend some time to find the simplest possible configuration to start a Rails project using Docker.

[https://github.com/bdavidxyz/simplest-rails-docker](https://github.com/bdavidxyz/simplest-rails-docker)

I picked some ideas from other projects from GitHub, trying to remove as much files and as much lines per file as possible.

With Ruby-on-Rails, you can't start a project without a properly initialized, configured, and started database. You also can't start the local server without a webpack dev server running (from Rails 6 I guess). So that's make 3 services running at least before even to print a "hello world" page.

This kind of project is extremely useful to test various tools and versions without polluting your local machine. I find it also more professional to use Docker instead of brittle, quickly-too-old documentation. So it could be a starting point for a more serious configuration.

What do you think ? What could be simplified ? Do you have more simple examples ? How do you test tools in isolation ? Thanks for your returns, and stay safe :)

Oh hi, it's me again! :)

Still trying to do a GraphQL api with rails, but I've hit a snag. I am doing an order management system, and it's not going to be worth much unless I can add products to an order. I have set them up with a Product model and an Order model with a has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many relationship. ie. Product has\_many orders and Order has\_many products. that part seems to be working fine, I made a join table and as far as I can see it works.

The problem arrises when I am using GraphQL. The documentation is hard to find once you move away from the most basic queries and mutations. alas, I am in the process for doing the CreateOrder mutation for my api, as I need to add products on creation, i.e whatever the user orders.

&amp;#x200B;

first I had the ProductType for an argument, but I realized that's a non starter and found out I need to create an input type for it, so I did:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4shn61uo5t41.png?width=1148&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a980bee0b3c47d68aa12e49a7fb103592c0c87

At this point this, I don't know if this is even the correct way of doing it, because I wasn't able to find a Ruby example online. Either way, GraphQL isn't complaining at least. So I try calling the mutation like so:

&amp;#x200B;

and it is at this point that everything falls apart as rails gives me the error:

    Product(#375140) expected, got #&lt;Types::ProductInputType:0x00007fb1a791b8c8 u/context=#&lt;Query::Context ...&gt;, u/ruby_style_hash={:id=&gt;1}, u/arguments_by_keyword={:id=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1aa96ec00 u/name="id", u/type_expr=Integer, u/description=nil, u/null=false, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:id, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=#&lt;GraphQL::Schema::NonNull u/of_type=GraphQL::Types::Int&gt;&gt;, :name=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1aa96d3c8 u/name="name", u/type_expr=String, u/description=nil, u/null=true, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:name, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=GraphQL::Types::String&gt;, :organization_id=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1aa96c6f8 u/name="organizationId", u/type_expr=Integer, u/description=nil, u/null=true, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:organization_id, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=GraphQL::Types::Int&gt;, :description=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1a6c734b8 u/name="description", u/type_expr=String, u/description=nil, u/null=true, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:description, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=GraphQL::Types::String&gt;, :inventory=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1a6c72400 u/name="inventory", u/type_expr=Integer, u/description=nil, u/null=true, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:inventory, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=GraphQL::Types::Int&gt;, :images=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1a6c712f8 u/name="images", u/type_expr=String, u/description=nil, u/null=true, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:images, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=GraphQL::Types::String&gt;, :price=&gt;#&lt;Types::BaseArgument:0x00007fb1a6c70128 u/name="price", u/type_expr=Float, u/description=nil, u/null=true, u/default_value=:__no_default__, u/owner=Types::ProductInputType, u/as=nil, u/loads=nil, u/keyword=:price, u/prepare=nil, u/ast_node=nil, u/from_resolver=false, u/method_access=true, u/type=GraphQL::Types::Float&gt;}&gt; which is an instance of Types::ProductInputType(#372160)

&amp;#x200B;

it would be nice if someone in this awesome community could give me a pointer in the right direction, either by telling me what's wrong here, or by sharing a tutorial that covers something similar, because I haven't been able to find one on my own :/

Hey all,   


My Events page is up and running, I'm looking to add member to the event now.

I would like to have a group created when the event is created allocating the event creator as a group member, group admin(bool) and link the event to the group.

  
The event has many users and should be indicated via a event group.

Looking for the best/easiest way to implement this.  


All idea's/comments welcome.  


Thanks
## [8][Are there any *recent* Doorkeeper+Devise tutorials to make a Oauth2 server provider?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/g23ewp/are_there_any_recent_doorkeeperdevise_tutorials/)

I've been struggling a lot to put together an Oauth2 provider. The tutorials I've found are either from 2015-2016 (with code that needs adjustments), or make some substantial assumptions (such as building on top of previous code from a previous guide).

I tried to follow these guides:

https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/02/11/oauth2-on-rails/  
https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/03/02/oauth2-on-rails-the-client-application/

But I get some errors about missing parameters. As I am totally new to this topic I've no idea what exactly I'm supposed to look for, or what to change.

My intention is to make an oauth2 provider for my Rails and Node applications.

Any tutorials you may know? Or perhaps somewhere I could investigate further?

Hey guys. I have a few , uuid, string-based columns that have uniqueness constraints. Sometimes the uuid needs to be removed on update. Since there are objects that do not yet have a uuid (i.e. an empty string). I get hit with a database error. Is there any way to keep the uniqueness uniqueness constraint with this in mind?

I've just finished this feature but I am getting an assets:precompile error that I can't figure out.  On Heroku, the error is:
