TL;DR: What are things in JS or it\`s ecosystem (tool-chain) that anoys you? ;)

Historicaly there was a lot of hate on JS for it's ecosystem, and rolling jokes about how every day welcomes new JS framework.

But  as I work for over 2 years with JavaScript every day, I must admire,  that I really enjoy it. I like it\`s broad areas of usage (browsers,  servers, native applications, even IoT), package managing (that may be controversial, I know), and  especially open source projects that grown around JS, like Vue, Svelte,  React, deno, nvm or volta, whole JAMStack thing, and countles more  amazing projects. There was a chatoic time after ES6 release, but now,  it is with us for few years. There are many bundlers and build tools  available, and everyone can choose something that best suits their  needs.

Yet still, I hear people complaining on some aspects of JS every day. Therefore I would like to hear you, [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/) community, what are things you don't like about working with JS, and why?
