Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

It's FOSS.  You never know, this might fit your precise coding paradigm better than any of the others.

You make a mistake : cannot an object of abstract type 'drawEllipse'. 
Writing in qt.
I changed the name of drawEllipse, but it didn't help, what could be the problem?

From Hans Wennborgs email:

&gt; Some highlights include:

&gt; - C++ Concepts support in Clang

&gt; - Clang no longer runs in a separate process by default ("in-process cc1")

&gt; - Windows control flow guard (CFG) checks

&gt; - Support for more processor cores and features

## [11][Why can emplace_back in vectors call explicit constructors?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fowcp9/why_can_emplace_back_in_vectors_call_explicit/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fowcp9/why_can_emplace_back_in_vectors_call_explicit/

    class person
    {
        public:
        
        std::string name;
        int age;
        
        explicit person(int _age) :
        age(_age)
        {
            name = "John Doe";
        }
        
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        std::vector&lt;person&gt; people;
        
        people.emplace_back(60); //compiles and uses explicit method to cast from int
        
        people.push_back(60); //compiler error
        
        system("pause");
    }

&amp;#x200B;

trying to use push\_back() will give a compiler error, as expected.

Meanwhile, emplace\_back() uses the explicit method as a cast, which is definitely not the programmers intention.  Is there a reason for why this is allowed here?

thanks.
