Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Setting hardware watchpoints in GDB has been incredibly slow, most times it just crashes. Does anyone else have this problem or it's just me and my machine. I use gdb version 8

I am watching videos from the latest CppCon event, speakers mention from time to time the C++ Core Guidelines and the support library (GSL) as a way to help modernize codebases and avoid known flaws. I'm trying to use those guidelines for my personal projects (enforced by Microsoft's analyzer, I don't know other analyzers), mostly because I'm still quite new to the language and see it as a good way to learn over time. But I'm wondering if it is actually used by the rest of the community, either in open source projects or at companies. I haven't seen the GSL used anywhere outside of my own code, and I don't often see it coming up in online discussions outside of public talks (though as I'm still new I may just not know about projects that are using them).

  
For the sake of discussion I would be interested to know who is using these (either the guidelines, or the support library, or both?), what are your opinions and experience with them (do you have rules you always disable?), and if you don't use them what are the reasons?  


For people who don't already know about them:  
\- C++ Core Guidelines:  [https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)   
\- Guidelines Support Library by Microsoft:  [https://github.com/microsoft/GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL)   
\- Lite Guidelines Support Library:  [https://github.com/gsl-lite/gsl-lite](https://github.com/gsl-lite/gsl-lite)   
\- How to use the Core Guidelines checker in Visual Studio:  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/using-the-cpp-core-guidelines-checkers?view=vs-2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/using-the-cpp-core-guidelines-checkers?view=vs-2019)

## [10][std::list::sort() vs std::sort()](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j3fjh8/stdlistsort_vs_stdsort/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j3fjh8/stdlistsort_vs_stdsort/
---
I understand that std::sort() cannot use its normal algorithm on an std::list because it needs a random access operator but can anyone explain why std::list was chosen to have a member function to sort versus a template specialization on std::sort()?
## [11][What would you call comparison, hashing, operator&lt;&lt;, etc?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j3ci27/what_would_you_call_comparison_hashing_operator/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j3ci27/what_would_you_call_comparison_hashing_operator/
---
The name "special member functions" refers to the Big Five or Six pieces of a class's API: default ctor, copy ctor, move ctor, dtor, assignment.

What would you call the stuff in the next tier down: operator&lt;, operator==, operator&lt;=&gt;, ADL swap, std::hash, operator&lt;&lt;, operator&gt;&gt;?  As in, "Your class correctly implements all its special member functions, but it's still missing some \_\_\_\_\_\_."  As in an appropriate title for a book chapter or a conference talk that goes into this stuff.

I think "polish" or even "chrome" captures the general intent, but requires extra explanation. "Common public API" is more like the flavor I'm looking for. "Utility API"?

Do other people even think of all that stuff in the same general category/tier? I predict at least a few "I don't understand the question" replies; will that be the dominant reaction?
