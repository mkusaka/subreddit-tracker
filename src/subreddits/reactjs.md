We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I was looking for a new job as a Full Stack Developer (MERN+GRAPHQL Stack) and all the companies make interviews with Javascript Algorithms for this role.

it's been a while from I stopped to exercise with Algorithms =&gt; problems are different when you work on a Web/Desktop/Mobile Application but it would appear that you need to review some Algo. exercises just to prepare for a 40minuts interview and never approach again these types of problems.

Are these exercises make you a SENIOR? What makes you a senior developer?

What do you think about it guys? For me, a senior developer is who have a lot of experience in the field and know how to approach problems. It doesn't mean that it can't make research about syntax or particular features.
## [7][How do you feel about accepting/passing ES6 Sets and Maps as props?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ifi16z/how_do_you_feel_about_acceptingpassing_es6_sets/)

Some components may need to accept as props a list of unique items, or a mapping of arbitrary string keys to values (not an object with well-defined interfaces, mind you--for those I'll use plain objects 100%). In these cases, you could either use Sets vs arrays / Maps vs objects. So which do you prefer when writing a component?

My take on the pros and cons for each:

* Argument for arrays/objects:
    * Other devs are generally more familiar with arrays and objects
    * Existing APIs rarely use Sets and Maps
    * Existing code rarely expects to receive Sets and Maps
    * No transpiling needed
    * Sets and Maps require an extra constructor call
    * Sets and Maps need to be converted to arrays for functional iteration or random access by index
* Argument for Sets/Maps:
    * Sets guarantee uniqueness so you can avoid subtle logical bugs by design
    * Maps avoid prototype pollution and many other issues with objects
    * Maps guarantee insertion order-iteration, even for string keys that are integers

This is a bit older post - [https://medium.com/@RogerMitchell/using-requestly-in-visualforce-development-workflow-dd64e5f5998f](https://medium.com/@RogerMitchell/using-requestly-in-visualforce-development-workflow-dd64e5f5998f) in which Roger Mitchell from SalesForce shows how he simplified the development workflow in VisualForce. This is such an amazing technique and can be applied in many development setups.

Looking for ideas on what hacks/tricks you use to simplify your development setup.

Hi community!

I have created reference project to deploy a serverless, full-stack React app onto AWS with Terraform. This is a to-do list app with these features:

* Users can create, and read to-do's from AWS DynamoDB database
* Serverless i.e. app is hosted on an AWS S3 bucket; AWS API Gateway proxies requests to Lambda functions which query DynamoDB
* CI/CD pipeline by AWS CodePipeline
* All AWS infra are created by Terraform

Please take a look!

## [11][Optimizing rendering for large JSON data (1000&lt;)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ifod3s/optimizing_rendering_for_large_json_data_1000/)

So I'm implementing a JSON tree view for a technical test.

  
I'm using Redux as a state management, and recursive rendering to display the JSON children.

  
My redux state has the JSON in it but I was wondering about optimizing the rendering.

  
But I'm thinking of using redux-select as a way to optimize the rendering but I don't know how exactly

  
I'm also thinking about rendering the first 20 children of the JSON with a load more button   


What are your thoughts? 

It's more a question on how would you approach optimizing rendering for large data and I'd appreciate the ideas
