Hi! I'm working on a career change to coding and I've been learning React, among other things. I made this mortgage calculator and I wanted to show it off, simple as it is.

I used test-driven development principles with Jest and Enzyme to write the logic and interface, and then tried to get the app as responsive as I could figure out with CSS.

I have some ideas for further enhancements...I mean, I could hardly sneeze without enhancing it because it's so bare-bones simple. One thing I'd like to do is eventually port it to React Native and Electron. But I'm interested in other ideas.

Also, I'd appreciate any feedback on how close this is to a viable portfolio project. Thanks for taking a look and for any advice!

Ran a bunch of tests on App.js and I am wondering if there are any other test I can run on it. I am pretty sure there are tons and tons, but I would like to know if there's any test worth doing.

Hi all,

In a quest to build something that is worthy of being looked at by potential employers, I decided to build an advanced to-do list app.

It currently has:
- PWA, so you can install Everest on any device
- Natural Language Processing of tasks for dates (think Todoist)
- Firebase login to keep your data backed up securely so you can access it on any device
- and a whole lot more listed on the repo

What can I do to show employers this is a project worth putting on a resume?

Hi all I'm new here but I wanted to share with you my first proper react app -&gt; [**https://foiz.io/**](https://foiz.io/?q=bg)

If is free to use, vacation days (days off work) tracker that allows you to share your calendar with other people and see the public holidays for a specific country (for now it only works for Bulgaria and Netherlands but more are coming).

It would be great if you can check it, play with it, leave some feedback and if you like it share it with a fried :)

## [12][Nested routes and tabs with React (in Ionic)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ejvulq/nested_routes_and_tabs_with_react_in_ionic/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ejvulq/nested_routes_and_tabs_with_react_in_ionic/

Hello. I am posting this question again as I didn't get an answer last time on a different community. I have a list on my home page and when an item is clicked, I want to get the details of that item and show it in a tabbed format (3 different tabs to be specific). I am trying to get this done in React with Ionic 4. It involves nested routes like below:

```
/items -&gt; All items in a list
/items/:id -&gt; Get details of item with id = 'id'
/items/:id/:tab(name) -&gt; Details page with tab 'name'
```


Here's how I set it up with Ionic 4 and React:

Home.jsx
```
const App = () =&gt; (
  &lt;IonApp&gt;
      &lt;IonReactRouter&gt;
        &lt;Menu/&gt;
        &lt;IonRouterOutlet id="main"&gt;
          &lt;Route exact path="/items" component={ListPage} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/items/:id" component={DetailsPage }/&gt;
          &lt;Route exact path="/" render={() =&gt; &lt;Redirect to="/items" /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;/IonRouterOutlet&gt;
      &lt;/IonReactRouter&gt;
  &lt;/IonApp&gt;
);

```

In DetailsPage, I plan to fetch the data based on ID and then pass it to child component for different tab.

```
const DetailsPage = ({match}) =&gt; {
	
    // Fetch Data and pass it as props later
	
    return (
      &lt;IonTabs&gt;

        &lt;IonRouterOutlet&gt;
          &lt;Route exact path={`${match.path}/:tab(tab1)`}&gt;
            &lt;TabOne goBack={goBack}/&gt;
          &lt;/Route&gt;
          
          &lt;Route exact path={`${match.path}/:tab(tab2)`}&gt;
            &lt;TabTwo goBack={goBack}/&gt;
          &lt;/Route&gt;
          
          &lt;Route exact path={`${match.path}/:tab(tab3)`}&gt;
            &lt;TabThree goBack={goBack}/&gt;
          &lt;/Route&gt;

          &lt;Route 
            exact path={match.path} 
            render={() =&gt; &lt;Redirect to={`${match.url}/tab1`}/&gt;}
          /&gt;

        &lt;/IonRouterOutlet&gt;

        &lt;IonTabBar slot="bottom"&gt;
          &lt;IonTabButton tab="tab1" href={`${match.url}/tab1`}&gt;
            &lt;IonIcon icon={informationCircle} /&gt;
            &lt;IonLabel&gt;Tab 1&lt;/IonLabel&gt;
          &lt;/IonTabButton&gt;
          &lt;IonTabButton tab="tab2" href={`${match.url}/tab2`}&gt;
            &lt;IonIcon icon={people} /&gt;
            &lt;IonLabel&gt;Tab 2&lt;/IonLabel&gt;
          &lt;/IonTabButton&gt;
          &lt;IonTabButton tab="tab3" href={`${match.url}/tab3`}&gt;
            &lt;IonIcon icon={text} /&gt;
            &lt;IonLabel&gt;Tab 3&lt;/IonLabel&gt;
          &lt;/IonTabButton&gt;
        &lt;/IonTabBar&gt;

      &lt;/IonTabs&gt;
    );
};

```

I am not sure if it's the dynamic `:id` parameter or something else but navigating to the details page for the first time redirects to /tab1 but if I change the tab and go back to list page and then again navigate to details page, it doesn't seem to redirect me to /tab1. I can see some other weird behaviors but I have lack of better words to describe it. I think I am missing something with the routing.

The complete code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/imxdn/ionic-tabbed-page)
