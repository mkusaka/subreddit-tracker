I'm using Prettier, YouCompleteMe, UltiSnips, and Supertab. But I can't find an easy to use and reliable auto-import plugin.

What's your Vim setup for JS/TS?

Edit to add: I tried using CoC and didnâ€™t like it. It was very clunky, the type hints were nowhere near as good as YCM and the setup was rather brittle.
