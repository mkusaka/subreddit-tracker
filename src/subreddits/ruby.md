I installed Ruby via Homebrew so I didn't f-up my system Ruby. I then started a project and installed some executable gems (Jekyll and rubocop). However, when I try to run either command, I receive the error `zsh: command not found`.

Here is my `gem env` output:
```

I did confirm that the rubocop executable is in /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/bin. Do I need to add this directory to $PATH?
