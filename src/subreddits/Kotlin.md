Hi, I am currently learning Kotlin basics on JetBrains Academy, because I think it's an awesome language. I learnt that it is often seen as the first choice for Android developers. I already have a little experience with Android apps via Dart/Flutter, but while the framework is generally good, I had a few problems with wrapping my head around some concepts. I hope that I will be able to make a fresh start with Kotlin.

While I still have to learn a lot about the basics before I can start developing apps, I was wondering about how an app UI is designed in Kotlin. I know that Kotlin is runnable on Android because of the JVM, but how do I design the frontend? Are there frameworks similar to Flutter or do I have to resort to Java frameworks like SWING or JavaFX (hopefully not)? And how is it done usually?

Currently I am not trying to develop an app, so I am just curious at this point, but later I might actually need this information.

Thanks!

I really like Django's built-in admin app for managing database entries for the models. Is there an equivalent for the Ktor framework?

I'm a teen and I'm sort of a beginner at programming. Schools in my country don't have programming as part of their curriculum and there aren't people around me into programming. I've been into it for about six years but never had enough time so after each holiday I usually had no time for it until the next holiday. That's changed for the last nine months and a lot more since this whole lockdown thing began in my country since the end of March. I began with python and moved to learn java. I was able to learn and understand concepts like variables, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, etc. I moved to java because I wanted to find something that I could use what I  was learning on and I originally thought I wanted to go into android development. It ended up that I found out from that and my earlier experience with HTML and CSS that I only loved the programming and logical side of all this and I'm not really into UI design and all that since its not a set of instructions or formulae like things and I'm not really good at that. So now I have nothing to use to practice my java with even though I've continued with learning it. And as this goes on, learning something without having a purpose for the knowledge I've and still am acquiring, I'm becoming less passionate about what I'm doing. Now that I've got a lot more time on my hands I'm trying to find something I can use what I'm learning for. The problem is whenever I search for different programming languages and their uses java included I keep seeing things like native, frameworks, etc. And the explanations I keep seeing aren't helping to explain what those things are so I don't know what path I want to go on with programming. I wouldn't mind continuing java or going for a new language with the time I have on my hands just that I just want an understanding of what different programming languages are used for so I can use that to help with my path.

 The **Sliding Window Algorithm** is primarily used for the problems dealing with linear data structures like Arrays, Lists, Strings etc.

I'm not sure if this would be found in the official documentation ot not, but if anyone could direct me towards the relevant literature that could help me form the basic building blocks for the types of programs I've described above, that'd be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
## [7][How to access constructor variables in a function?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gyhnk4/how_to_access_constructor_variables_in_a_function/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/gyhnk4/how_to_access_constructor_variables_in_a_function/

This is probably a noob question but can someone explain this. I made a constructor and initialize the variables within it and try to access those variables within in a function but it gave me a compilation error "Unresolved reference: telephone" and it is highlighted red. I am thinking telephone is already initialize in the constructor.

Here is the code: 

import java.util.regex.Pattern

class Person(name: String = "", var age: Int = 0, val address: String = "", var telephone: String = "") {  
}  
fun validateTelephone(): String {  
 val pattern = Pattern.compile("\\\\d{3}\[-\]\\\\d{4}")  
 val matcher = pattern.matcher(telephone)

I'm trying to access the DOM by retrieving an element I've defined in my HTML file. However, each time I try and fetch it in Kotlin by using `document.getElementById("someCanvas") as HTMLCanvasElement?` it returns null (or ClassCastException without the optional operator).

Why could this be happening? I can write to the DOM and console, but can't fetch anything from it.

I come from java and am just confused about constructors in Kotlin. I know a bit about secondary constructor and that they have to call the primary constructor, so my question is, can there be more than one primary constructor in a class and if so, how?
