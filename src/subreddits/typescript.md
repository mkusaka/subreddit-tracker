I created a FULLY TYPED Twitter API Client for Node.js ðŸ”§  
This client is taking full advantage of modern TypeScript capabilites!

âœ… **Fully typed!** Both for query parameters and responses.  
âœ… Includes 90% of the **official Twitter API** endpoints.  
âœ… **Promise-based!** No ugly callbacks.  
âœ… Inbuilt in-memory **cache** for rate-limit friendly usage.

Check it out ðŸ‘‡

It's by far my most common use of !. In strict mode all Env variables have an implicit type of `string | undefined`.

Just curious if you guys also use ! with them. Or if you do something else such as asserting `process.env` as `any`

Hi, I've run into Typescript failing to infer something and I'm trying to understand why. This simple example works:

```
type Group&lt;A, B&gt; = {
    createA: () =&gt; A,
    aToB: (a: A) =&gt; B,
};

function doSomething&lt;A, B&gt;(group: Group&lt;A, B&gt;) {
    const a = group.createA();
    const b = group.aToB(a);

    return b;
}

const example = doSomething({
    createA: () =&gt; 123,
    aToB: (value) =&gt; value.toString(),
});
```

So `example` is inferred as `Group&lt;number, string&gt;`, aToB's value parameter is number, `aToB` returns a string. All makes sense.

But if I add another function to `Group` that takes `B` as a parameter:

```
type Group&lt;A, B&gt; = {
    createA: () =&gt; A,
    aToB: (a: A) =&gt; B,
    logB: (b: B) =&gt; void
};

function doSomething&lt;A, B&gt;(group: Group&lt;A, B&gt;) {
    const a = group.createA();
    const b = group.aToB(a);

    group.logB(b);

    return b;
}

const example = doSomething({
    createA: () =&gt; 123,
    aToB: (value) =&gt; value.toString(),
    logB: (value) =&gt; console.log(value)
});
```

`A` remains a number, but `B` becomes `unknown`.

I'm trying to figure out why this is. I assume now that `B` is used as a parameter, that stops Typescript from being able to infer `B` as being the result of `createA`, and since there's no type on `logB: (value)`, it gives up and calls it unknown.

I can get around this by `logB: (value: string) =&gt; console.log(value)`, but is there a way to tell Typescript to always infer `B` from the return type of `createA`, even if it's used as a parameter elsewhere?

Hi, good evening!

My name is William and I am a senior engineer based in the UK.

I am looking for a couple of junior developers who would like to work with me on an open source project that aims to help photographers and other media artist with a workflow manager.

If anyone is looking for a project to work on to learn more about Vue and TypeScript, I would be very happy to mentor them.

Cheers!

## [6][Typesafe, future proof way to get from "unknown" to "SomeInterfaceType" without "any"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j17c1h/typesafe_future_proof_way_to_get_from_unknown_to/)

Is there a way to build functions with the signature of either `isSomeInterface(x:unknown):x is SomeInterface` or `assertSomeInterface(x:unknown):asserts x is SomeInterface` in a way that doesn't use `any`, and will break if I add a property to `SomeInterface` without changing the type guard?

I want a series of refinements, by the end of which the compiler knows that `x is SomeInterface` and it can therefore let me know if a change happens to `SomeInterface` and that's no-longer knowable.

Thoughts?

In this example, is it possible to have \`printName\` only accept an instance of a Cat? Currently it also accepts objects matching the interface defined by Cat, which may lead to bugs down the road

    class Cat {
        constructor(public name: string) {
            if (name.length &lt;= 1) {
                throw new Error('Name is too short!');
            }
        }
    }
    
    function printName(cat: Cat) {
        console.log(cat.name);
    }
    
    // printName(new Cat('')); // Good, would like to enforce this usage
    printName({name: ''}); // No warning from TypeScript :(

This workaround enforces that usage

    function printName(cat: Cat) {
        if (cat instanceof Cat) {
          console.log(cat.name);
        }
        throw new Error('Invalid cat');
    }

However, can this be checked at compile-time through a type instead?

Inside the if statement towards the bottom, I notice i am getting a lint on a type that seems to be inferred:

        const requestOptions = {
          method,
          mode: 'cors',
          headers: {
            authorization: `Bearer ${this.decryptedAccessToken}`,
            'content-type': options.contentType || 'application/json',
            ...options.specialHeaders,
          },
        };
    
        if (method === 'post') {
          requestOptions.body = body;
        }
    
    /*
        Property 'body' does not exist on type '{ method: "post" | "get"; mode: string; headers: any; }'.ts(2339)
    */

I tried various syntaxes for annotating and asserting an extended type that includes the `body` key but came up short. Can someone tell me how to properly type this to allow the new key `body`?

The method buildEndpointUrl has an optional 2nd argument for queryParams. 

My intent below is to say "The options object sometimes isn't passed in. And then, sometimes it doesn't have a key for queryParams" 

I feel like only the first sentence is being implemented on line 3. But I can not put a ? on `.queryParams` there. 

So is a property always assumed optional if the parameter is defined as optional?

      public async get(urlPath: string, options?: GetRequestOptions): Promise&lt;object | void&gt; {
        const fullEndpointUrl = this.buildEndpointUrl(urlPath, options?.queryParams);
    
    private buildEndpointUrl
      &lt;QueryParamsShape extends { [idx: string]: string | string[] }&gt;(
        urlPath: string, queryParams?: QueryParamsShape
