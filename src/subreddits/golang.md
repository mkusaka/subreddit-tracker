Hello again,

For couple of weeks ago I’ve stated that I will be ditching Python in favor for Go and try to use it where I can. I’m system engineer and my primary field is to keep our hybrid environment up and running and automate all the things but not only that because I also work as backend dev. I’ve always used Python for small backend services and glue things together. Then in 2019 I’ve came across Golang. It seemed nice but was little bit afraid of static typing and not “OOP” design but because Golang was created with concurrency in mind and thought to give a shoot. After spending couple of months with it I can say that it is the pleasure to have something like Golang. I know that some guys said that Python is mainly the DevOps language and automation standard and I should still use python to such things but I like to challenge myself so I decided to try and I can’t complain at all! CLI tools? No problem! One binary file, push it and done. Backend? Like Python async is messy but with Golang is so simple because language it self was intended to be used across multiple CPUs. Now I’m again very excited about programming like the first time I met Python. I know that Golang may or not be the best language for automation like many says but I can’t see why. The Golang libs is growing massively right now and most of cloud automation tools are written in Golang so when you know Golang, it is so fun to just see source code and that you can understand what’s doing under the hood. I know that there’s few people right now who’s using Golang for automation etc. but it was the same thing for many years ago with Python. We need to start somewhere I would with pleasure recommend Golang to other devops guys because it’s very flexible language so now I think, after spending some time with Golang that this is what I’ve looked for. Besides with Golang you will understand many things better that with Python about how programming works in real. I think. 

It’s just my 5 cents and I may be wrong about my statements so what’s your thoughts about Golang in devops world? Would like to hear your opinion.

And last but not least - great community!

This has been purely for fun. It started off with doing problems in hacker rank and I would solve each problem in Python and Go. Very quickly, pythons std lib allowed me to answers questions with less coding than Go. I love Go and use it in my professional life.. so for fun I decided to recreate "some" of pythons collections package (also through in a set implementation), which uses as little reflection as possible and instead relies on interfaces.

I have recently setup a moosefs docker cluster and now I want to run my go application in the dockers. What will be the best place to find a good learning tutorial to install and run a go application inside the docker container?

Consequent to a great feedback to [BotKube](https://www.botkube.io/), an application for messengers like Slack and Mattermost to monitor and debug Kubernetes deployments, we have got interests from Microsoft Teams users for an integration. An integration, which would help them monitor their Kubernetes cluster from a Teams client. Since BotKube is architecturally designed to work independently of a messaging platform, it seemed a viable thing to integrate it with Teams.

Microsoft Teams uses the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) to allow users to write bot applications. The Bot Framework is a set of tools, SDKs, templates and services to build conversational bot applications. The official SDKs are available for Python, C#.NET, Java and Javascript. Since BotKube is built in Go, there was a need of an interface to the Bot Framework services in Go, for a seamless integration of BotKube to Teams. This encouraged us to write a Go SDK that wraps the services of the Bot Framework.

Today, we are excited to announce the first release of the [Bot Framework SDK for Go](https://github.com/infracloudio/msbotbuilder-go); an SDK written in Go that enables users to build bot applications over the Bot Framework in Golang. The SDK enables application developers to build conversational bots for Microsoft Teams.

A bot application built using this SDK can send text, interactive cards and attachments in a conversation with a user. Apart from a receive-reply conversation, developers can build bot applications to push messages in a conversation to Teams client.
