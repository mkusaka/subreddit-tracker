This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hey folks, I'm sharing my personal library that I use in every project of mine, it has things found working from StackOverflow to things I've written personally to take shortcuts, copied some from Github and modified them to work as intended just to make the Android development easier.

[GitHub link](https://github.com/CraZyLegenD/Set-Of-Useful-Kotlin-Extensions-and-Helpers)

It lacks documentation at some places, but the methods are quite self explanatory, feel free to contribute or to use it in your projects, pull requests are welcomed as well as if something doesn't work feel free to open an issue or if you find your code add headers/credits that's yours and make a pull request.

Earlier this week I submitted an app on the Google Play Store for review. The app is about movies and you can search the database for movie titles, trailers, ratings, reviews, etc. 

I have given fair attributions to any open-source material that I have used in the app. However, the app was rejected based on non-compliance with the copyright content policy. 

The only thing that comes to mind is that I have used the IMDb icon for showing the IMDb ratings. It isn't event the official logo, just an icon made with sort of the same design. I have seen the IMDb icon used in several apps before without attribution.  

I have contacted the customer support but they haven't replied yet. Can anyone please help?

It says [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379) that it's not allowed to publish a **"Game cheating apps that affect the gameplay of other apps."**

&amp;#x200B;

So... is publishing an app that provides a **PUBLIC** information about your opponent in a specific game allowed?

&amp;#x200B;

* The app won't guarantee you a win, it’s just gives a valuable information
* The information I provide is public and anyone can search for it

Hello, so I'm nit new to android, I've used it back in college and I gitta say it's the most fun I had, I love java and everything related to it, I haven't started learning kotlin but I'm aure I'll get the hang of it easily.

At my current job I'm a full stack web developer and my current company only used react native and flutter for ther mobile projects and I'm afraid that most companies do as well, I really hate JavaScript/typescript so going the reactnative route is not for me, I want native android development, I know the difference between the two approaches from a quality and financial standpoint for companies, I really want to do this, because whenever I'm vored or I think of an idea it's always on android and i just take note of it and think if there's a way to do ot on the web and I ended up forgetting about it.

Have anyone here switched from web to mobile and how lng did you wait to find a job and do you work just with java/kotlin or do you use js frameworks?

**How to download the songs?**

You can download all of them in one RAR &amp; ZIP file by following this [Bandcamp](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/releases) link.

**Is this album updated regularly?**

Yes! Whenever I add a new song or sound effect to the library, I announce it on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onemansymphony). I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDhmSe6HNJgAAfAjNZlrxDg?view_as=subscriber) where I upload the songs to. I would suggest checking the tweets/videos or the album page regularly if you're in need of new music frequently.

**What's the total size of the library and in which format do they come in?**

Total file size varies in format. You can download the songs in MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, ALAC, WAV and AIFF formats.

**How can I support this project?**

I'm planning to expand this library's content as much as possible, and doing so takes a great amount of time, and calls for new virtual instruments and tools to create songs in rich and different sound. My current goal is to keep adding more songs in different genres into this library as well as creating environmental sound effects in high quality.  Also Bandcamp limits the quantity of free downloads so I need to buy more "free download credits" to make the album even more accessible. More information about the subject can be found [​here](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2010/09/09/free-downloads-power-ups/). Due to these reasons, I created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony) page if you'd like to support this project. I'm using the donations I'm getting through Patreon to buy new virtual instruments at the moment. By becoming a Patron, **you'll get access to the loop files, bonus and alternative songs and sound effects** that are not included in the public library hosted on Bandcamp.

**Can I listen to these songs on Spotify?**

Yes! Uploading the songs to Spotify takes longer than uploading them to Bandcamp so not all of the songs are available on Spotify yet, but you can listen to some of them by following this [Spotify link.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2thNcRskFqUVCvEZnjrSGl?si=rP0D7jhjSGu1weaLN1jx5Q)

**What about the license? (CC BY 4.0)**

You can use any song in this library in anyway you want, be it as a sound effect in your game or as a background music in one of your Youtube &amp; Twitch videos, even commercially. If you'd like to find more information about the license, please check this [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) link. Providing an appropriate credit (Either Composed by [onemansymphony.bandcamp.com](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com) or patreon.com/onemansymphony) is required.

**How should I credit you?**

You can provide a link to one of the websites above in your project's description section (Youtube, Vimeo, etc). If you're planning to use them in a movie, you can provide one of the links in the rolling credit section.

**Are these songs loopable?**

Almost every single song in the album (with a few exceptions here and there) is loopable. While producing these songs, I always paid extra attention to make them as loopable as possible since some users would like to break a song into seperate pieces and just want to use that specific section of the song in their projects, and some people might like to extend a specific part of the song for adaptive sound design purposes. I am very well aware of that modern video games call for an application of adaptive sound design. A song which is made of different sections should be easily loopable &amp; cuttable and any section of the song should be easily extandable. And whenever a transition occurs, it should sound as smooth as possible. These were the things that I kept in my mind while composing these pieces. If you'd like to create your own loop files out of these songs, you can use a free software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to do so and refer to its [manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/) to learn more about how looping is done. If you don't want to spend your time with the process of looping, you can subscribe to my $1 tier on Patreon where you can get access to the loop files of the songs in the library.

**Will you make different/alternative versions of the songs?**

I already did this with some songs such as Uncharted Planet and After The Disaster, and I keep planning to do so.  I think it's important to be able to evoke different emotions by using different variations of a main theme. Having and using alternative tracks also help with maintaining the musical integrity of the main medium/emotion.

**What DAW do you use to compose these songs?**

Mostly FL Studio.

**If I suggested a theme, would you compose something that in theme?**

I'm definitely open to new ideas! I can't make any promises on if I will definitely compose something in that theme/mood/genre and how long completing it would take, but please feel free to make suggestions if you think there is a lack of resources in a genre/mood/theme/etc.

**Why do you do this?**

A few years ago I was creating my own scenes in a game engine and Blender 3D. Sometimes, needed some tracks to test the scenes to see how things were getting together. I realized that even though it was relatively easy to find tracks that sound 8-bit, it was pretty difficult to find high quality and various tracks in other genres such as ambient and BGM. So instead of waiting for someone to create such album, I did it myself. (I've been writing music since I was a kid so I thought why not record and share them with people who might be in need of them just like I was.)

**Do you do commissions?**

I do and I offer very reasonable prices. You can contact me on Twitter if you have an idea and would like to discuss it with me.

Feel free to ask if you guys have any questions.
## [10][A backstory, history and interesting details on Google Play Services for Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iaafny/a_backstory_history_and_interesting_details_on/)

Introduced in 2012, Google play services is an API framework provided by Google on top of Android.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1q8k8vlbhbh51.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7287b10b5ebe28cd9a16f4b339315a4fda5a9920

Internally called GMS Core, Play Services is primarily backed up by Google servers.

Providing access to Google Drive, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Pay, Google Play Game Services as well as APKs for core background services such as GoogleOneTimeInitializer, SetupWizard, GooglePackageInstaller and many more of them, **it is a way for Android Developers to get Native Android Development experience to talk to Google Backend servers and stuff that’s run by Google.**

**Prior to Play Services’ existence**, you would go directly to Google Servers and communicate with REST APIs and do JSON parsing yourself. A lot of effort and a lot of low-level mechanisms Android Developers would struggle with.

One of the few things that Play Services made available is that you don’t have to do JSON parsing yourself, you get a nice JAVA data structure to deal with.

Another cool thing is adding Offline writes, so if you want to write something to the cloud you call API in play services and it stores in local device database for you and gets to cloud as soon as the network constraints are satisfied. If you are offline or have a bad network, play services will handle retries.

**Play Services is delivered through Google Play Store**, so updates to plugins or libraries can happen on regular basis and the Android Team can update the implementation details of the code on devices that do not get System Image Updates. The OS itself is not updated but only the Play Services on the fly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jyokpwchbh51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffd96aab3d4bda667154e52bd3e0a05d4413c8c9

    What makes it to Google Play Services?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cqsi0xehbh51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f7302731287e74db416df0e945bd2e336661fe1

The primary goal is to put things backed by Google Services. So something like Volley, RecyclerView libraries won’t be added to Play Services as they are not specific to Google services.

    How does the communication work between an Android App and Play Services?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o22kiynghbh51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c453be7c3eddc43b1850fb87097c5c6d4526ab65

The Android app and services run in separate processes for security, stability, and memory management reasons, but they need to communicate and share data. This is where the Binder mechanism is used.

*The Play Services library primarily sets up the IPC link between your application running in your process and the play services application running in a separate process and then API calls are made that go through Binder across to the implementation running in Play Services process.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6idl3kfjhbh51.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50fe2e0f0ef628bdc955049e44e2827fd0c6dc5a

**Google Play Services APIs primarily are set up to be asynchronous.**

    What is the MIN SDK Version for Play Services?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxf0i5yhhbh51.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f368e8d9c071f3838a980f3758e0a11fbab2ff19

In 2014, the Play Services had support up to Ginger Bread, Version 9. In 2020, the support seems to be up to Jelly Bean. Older Versions of Android are locked to the last Play Services version that they support.

    Exploring the case of Closed-source, OEMs, and silent updates.

Getting LG, Samsung, Xiaomi, and the other OEMs to update their devices to the latest version of Android is difficult. By the time the OEMs get the new version, port their skins over, ship a build to carriers, and the carriers finally push out the over-the-air update, users are restrained from experiencing the latest versions.

If the device isn’t popular enough, this process doesn’t happen at all. Updating a phone is a massive project involving several companies.

**Since it’s really hard to push out an Android update, Google’s solution is to sidestep the process completely with Play Services.**

*Play Services has lots of permissions.* It’s kind of a system-level process. Play Services constantly runs in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v10jd3gkhbh51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=156c09bd7e53afec0571853cfdf76922faf3bf6f

Play Services has its’ own update mechanism that the user cannot control. The whole point of the Play Service update is to not let the end-user know about its’ updates.

**Original equipment manufacturers are not allowed to modify the Play Services. It’s not open source as it is part of the Google package.**

When you can update services without having to update a System Image, it is a win-win for end-user and Google and the OEMs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b27xrkglhbh51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b052f7087ceed21390d1e52a8fb4bc962985882b

Play Services is only available to smartphone OEMs through a license with Google, which OEMs need to apply for once they pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite and Google Test Suite on a per-device basis.

*Since the inclusion of GMS and GMS Core is behind a license, and practically all major apps have grown to be reliant on Play Services and its APIs for many of their core functions, Google retains complete control of the Android ecosystem despite Android being open-sourced as an OS.*

It is likely that, as an Android user, not in China, **you cannot practically use Android without Google**, given that you would lose out on Google Sign-in, Admob, Google Maps, nearly all Google Apps.

**One of the popular alternatives though not complete replacement to Play Services is the Micro G project.** It is the re-implementation of Google’s proprietary Android user space apps and libraries.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8q33m3kmhbh51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b207718b499087660076c3dfb2a4ed3c3b16e35

On an ending note, Google Mobile Services is a collection of Google applications and APIs that help support functionality across devices.

These apps work together seamlessly to ensure your device provides a great user experience right out of the box and this also means Google has full control over each and every Android Phone despite the open-source.

Let's say I have key/variable in my database where I want to reset its value to 0 everyday at 12:00 AM. How do I do this? I need to do this for my Android application.
