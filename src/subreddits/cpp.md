Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

SGI shipped a rope implementation but it seems to have been forgotten about. Does anyone know the history behind it?

(A rope allows for efficient manipulation of strings)

The class says its for absolute beginners, and I work much better with instructors than self studying.  Its very cheap, and it looks to me like a good way to get some instructor guided experience. I'm already taking a few Udemy classes, do you guys think this instructor lead class for six weeks would be a good idea?

**What is it?**

Command line tool that uses a character-level LSTM model to generate text that resembles a real language (including programming languages). One can both train a network from scratch or download a pretrained one (C++, Go, JavaScript, C, Python,..).

**Motivation**

I recently switched to touch typing and I realized that there is basically no way to practise typing of programming languages (other than actually programming). Additionally, I revisited the famous blog post [http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and thought it would be cool to use a model like this to generate infinite amount of custom text to type.

As someone learning C++, it seems like such a shame that pointer syntax does not use the '\^' symbol - was there some esoteric reason to go with '\*' ?

I have Just watched this entertaining video on Forbidden C++.  Its aimed at beginners but thought i would post it here just for the intro alone!

[https://youtu.be/j0\_u26Vpb4w](https://youtu.be/j0_u26Vpb4w)

The video is just a small list but as we all know, with every newer release of C++ we get better ways of doing things.  Hence the darker side of C++ will continue to grow!
## [11][Strings in switch statements using constexp hashing](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jkw84k/strings_in_switch_statements_using_constexp/)

I have a question which might be dumb.

If I am not mistaken, Java has switch-case statements that support strings. Such a thing is not possible with plain c++ but there is a workaround if we use a constexp hash function for converting a string to a size\_t value.

So lets say we have a program like this:


    constexpr size_t hash(const char* str){
        const long long p = 131;
        const long long m = 4294967291; // 2^32 - 5, largest 32 bit prime
        long long total = 0;
        long long current_multiplier = 1;
        for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i){
            total = (total + current_multiplier * str[i]) % m;
            current_multiplier = (current_multiplier * p) % m;
        }
        return total;
    }

    int main() {
        std::string val;
        std::cin &gt;&gt; val;
    
        switch (hash(val.c_str())){
            case hash("monday"):
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "Have a nice monday" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                break;
            case hash("tuesday"):
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "Have a nice tuesday" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                break;
            case hash("wednesday"):
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "Have a nice wednesday" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                break;
            case hash("thursday"):
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "Have a nice thursday" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                break;
            case hash("friday"):
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "Have a nice friday" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                break;
            default:
                std::cout &lt;&lt; "It is the weekend" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }

Would that be something bad to do. I don't really know a use case for now, but am interested if this would be OKish to do.

Edit: The edits were for making the code look like it should
