Hi Everyone,

I'm new-ish to working on Android apps and I'm trying to figure out how to react to audio inputs as they are happening. I've tried using MediaRecorder but can't seem to get it to run properly and all of the examples I see are only about saving the recordings.

What I'm trying to do is recognize when the microphone picks up a sound above a certain threshold then add a new row to a table when that happens. I've been at this all day and can't seem to make any progress so any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!
