Hi there, I recently started my programming journey... again. Haha. Well, the first time I tried to learn Ruby I gave up after a bit because it started to become a little too complicated for my novice mind and I had other higher priorities at the time. Anyways, i've begun again. I'm using Jay McGavren's book Head First Ruby which has been supremely good so far, and i've also been working on the Ruby course on Code Academy which I find less effective but also a nice change of pace.

Are there any other books or resouces online you guys could recommend to me to help me integrate this new information i'm taking in and, I guess, just have something else to chew on? Thank you
