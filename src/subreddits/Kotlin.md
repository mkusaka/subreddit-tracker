Hey guys,

I recently published a medium related to how can you extend your reactive default spring data repository methods. I hope it helps you not to face the same problem that I did. I was struggling a lot to figure out how can I achieve this and finally; I found it. Here is the link:

Thought maybe some of you guys doing Kotlin/JS might find it interesting to see how we used it to build a URL shortener on top of Ethereum.

[Source code here](https://github.com/mohamedelshami/AKAP-url-shortener), and if your browser supports ENS head on over to [redir.eth](https://redir.eth).
