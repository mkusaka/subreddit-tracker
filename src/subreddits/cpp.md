**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Hi,

I have a case in which I want to modify a variable inside a lambda expression in way that each new call of the lambda shall use this modified variable. I know it can be done with a temporary variable outside of the lambda. For example:
```C++
char* ptr = get_ptr();
std::transform(in.begin(), in.end(), out.begin(),
    [&amp;ptr](auto&amp; val) { return (*ptr++) + val; });
```

I wonder if I can achieve this without a temporary variable ptr. Using Visual Studio 2019 I successfully compiled the following code:
```C++
std::transform(in.begin(), in.end(), out.begin(),
    [&amp;ptr = get_ptr()](auto&amp; val) { return (*ptr++) + val; });
```

However, I cannot find in the [reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda#Lambda_capture) any information if this behavior will be consistent between C++ compilators. Could any of you give me a clue how does C++ standard handles the above case?

Thanks
## [7][vector transform constructor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fu8nuc/vector_transform_constructor/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fu8nuc/vector_transform_constructor/
---
Wouldn't it be nice to add a constructor to the vector class that takes a pair of iterators or a range and applies a transformation to the elements before their inserted? For example:

```
template&lt;class InputIt, class UnaryOperation&gt;
vector(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryOperation unary_op);
```

This would greatly simplify and be essentially equivalent to

```
std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec;
vec.reserve(other_vec.size());
std::transform(other_vec.begin(), other_vec.end(),
               std::back_inserter(vec), unary_func);

// becomes
std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec(other_vec.begin(), other_vec.end(), unary_func);
```

Is this a decent idea? I've been meaning to try to get involved in the standardization process in some way and submitting a paper for this would be a good place to start if the idea makes sense.

I was working on my own cryptocurrency exchange a couple of years ago, as a part of that I set out to make one of the fastest cryptocurrency matching engines in the industry. The project had been festering for quite a while, so I decided to extract out the matching engine portion and open source it.[https://github.com/wezrule/WezosTradingEngine](https://github.com/wezrule/WezosTradingEngine)

Disclaimer: I haven't largely looked at the code in 2 years (it still uses \`&lt;experimental/filesystem&gt;\` for instance!), but I tested it recently with gcc 7.5 and to my surprise it was still building and all tests passed, I wasn't sure what state it would be in. After some modifications it builds with MSVC, but I had to disable the main custom allocator for the order book (which is where most of the performance comes from!), so instead I've just left it as is. Mainly just putting this up as a learning resource for others who might find it of interest. Cheers

Hi everybody! I just started teaching myself C++ and I'm looking for a good IDE on Mac.

Thus far I have been working pretty low tech, coding in Vim and compiling manually / writing my own Makefiles. However, I'd like to start learning to code with an IDE so that it's less intimidating, and to better familiarize myself with the debugging process and build options. 

I've already heard that XCode is good, but I can't download the latest version without updating to Catalina and screwing my 32-bit apps, which I don't want to do.

Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated!
## [10][Error Checks + Inconsistent Boolean Conversion = ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fuaafj/error_checks_inconsistent_boolean_conversion/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fuaafj/error_checks_inconsistent_boolean_conversion/
---
Working with a code base that internally often returns `optional&lt;&gt;` and also `error_code`. There is also an `expect&lt;&gt;` type mixed in.

With `optional&lt;&gt;` or `expect&lt;&gt;` you check `if(!ret)` for error, but if an `error_code` is returned you check `if(ret)`. Easy?

I've never really been confronted with the immediate problem that kind of dimorphic error tests cause until there was a bug. God damn it! That's no fun when you have to deep dive into a mess of functions with lots of those nasty `if(!ret)` just to find out that one `if(!ret)` in a very rarely executed path that escaped the unit tests should have actually been an `if(ret)`. I cannot even blame the author, humans are just not meant to get this right consistently. But when the compiler cannot detect such errors (since the code is obviously well formed) I get scared. Like raw pointer magic scared - you never know when things are going to blow up. It might be a very good idea to consistently use something like `if(has_error(ret))` and overload that `has_error(...)` for `error_code` and `optional&lt;&gt;` and `expect&lt;&gt;` \- thus ditching the boolean conversions like plain new and delete and raw pointers in the hope to maybe produce less broken code.

In my humble and useless opinion error\_code should convert to boolean true if no error just for consistency or don't provide a boolean conversion at all. But that train has long left the station.

## [11][static const struct to constexpr, taking the address for memcpy, too many ways to declare constants](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftwovt/static_const_struct_to_constexpr_taking_the/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ftwovt/static_const_struct_to_constexpr_taking_the/
---
I'm updating some legacy code to C++17.  There's a header which defines test data in structs.  It uses the "static" keyword (in the C sense, outside of a class) to make the instances local to a translation unit (so that the header can be included in multiple cpp files without the linker complaining about duplicate symbol definitions).

`static const Foo foo1 { 0, 1, 0, 0 };`

`static const Foo foo2 { 2, 3, 0, 0 };`

`static const Bar bar1 { 0, 33, 0 };`

`// and so on for 2500 lines`

Since these structs are pure data, they can be constexpr.  However I'm not sure whether to declare them "`static constexpr`" or just "`constexpr`", and does it make any difference if I wrap them in an anonymous namespace or not?

This data is used as the source (but never the destination) of memcpy's.  I was surprised that the compiler did NOT complain about this when I changed the test data to constexpr.  Is this intended and safe (to take the address of a constexpr struct)?

When I tried to look this up, my search turned up questions about making sure the constexpr address is unique (aka persistent aka global) (which I don't need it to be) and things talking about declaring these as inline variables (which I don't know if I need) and a recommendation to make the constexpr a static member of a class (which I don't think I want).

If need be I can just replace all of the memcpy's with copy-assignments to render the question moot.  However it would be better if, for now, I can keep the existing memcpy'ing code as-is while using contexpr source values.  I guess I'm just looking for an explanation why it's even possible to take the address of a constexpr value &amp; assurance that's an intentional feature.

It seems C++ has accumulated so many old and new ways of declaring constant and "kind of constant" things (all with different benefits and pitfalls) that we need some kind of cheat sheet for this.  For example, "constexpr" implies "inline", but adding the word "inline" causes all the instances to share an address?  Or it causes them all to receive unique addresses?  We need a cheat sheet with a matrix of yes/no boxes.  The rows are things like "nonmember static", "static member", and columns like "weak linkage", "unique address", etc.

Most of the books I came across talks about basics of the language, even advanced topic donâ€™t seem to talk much about how to design a new project. 
What dictates what classes to use? How classes are connected to each other?

Any recommendation on how to progress on that side?
