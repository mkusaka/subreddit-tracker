Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

Wanted to share a library I co-wrote for exporting co-simulation models written in Python that is compatible with FMI 2.0.  [https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU](https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU)

The reason I share it in the cpp sub is that it is a nice example of how Python can be embedded from C++. See  [https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU/tree/master/pythonfmu/pythonfmu-export](https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU/tree/master/pythonfmu/pythonfmu-export) and especially  [https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU/blob/master/pythonfmu/pythonfmu-export/cpp/PySlaveInstance.cpp](https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU/blob/master/pythonfmu/pythonfmu-export/cpp/PySlaveInstance.cpp)

Hi everyone,

A while ago, I was looking for a math lib for game dev that supports my math conventions, all the features I need, and has a good syntax. I had problems with all of the existing libs, so I made my own. I also tried to solve other peoples' similar problems by making the library highly configurable with templates, so hopefully it supports your conventions and features as well.

I'm sharing this library in the hopes that it will be useful for your project. If you want to get into template meta-programming and modern C++, the source code may also be interesting to browse.

Let me know what you think: [https://github.com/petiaccja/Mathter](https://github.com/petiaccja/Mathter)

Iâ€™m currently trying to learn C++ and found a textbook laying around that was written in 1998. Has the language changed a lot since then? Is this too outdated?

Many recent posts in this subreddit about breaking ABI compatibility mention the ability to pass `unique_ptr` in a register as one of the potential benefits. While I agree this would be beneficial, I wonder how it can be done while preserving the following fundamental properties of objects:
- Construction / destruction order
- Object identity

I was taught that, in general, objects are destroyed in the opposite order of creation. This applies to class members, bases, function locals, and most crucially to temporaries.

In the expression:
   
    f(a(), b(), c());
   
The calls to `a()`, `b()`, and `c()` are indeterminately sequenced, but the temporary values returned live until the call to `f` returns, and then are destroyed in the opposite order. If one of those temporaries is a non-trivial object and is passed through a register, will this continue to be true?

I was also taught that, in general, the address of an object uniquely identifies that object (modulo base classes, first members, or objects that provide storage for other objects). In particular, if for some non-trivial type a constructor runs with `this` = some address, I can expect the destructor to eventually run with the same `this`. If we allow passing non-trivial objects through registers, how will this property be preserved?

I'm aware of one situation where the above is not the case - the proposed `[[trivially_relocatable]]` attribute. `unique_ptr` and even `shared_ptr` would benefit greatly from it, and its use "answers" my concerns. But will the imagined future ABI that allows passing non-trivial types in registers only allow it for types that opt in to this attribute?

## [10][Why does including existing libraries (e.g. fmt, ranges, etc.) into the standard matter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fg2kvq/why_does_including_existing_libraries_eg_fmt/)

After seeing all the excitement from people about upcoming changes to c++20 with the std::format and std::ranges, I'm a bit confused. The libraries exist already and you could make use of them before, yet people put a lot of effort and time into writing the technical specifications and proposals to include them into the std. I've seen Eric Niebler talking about including ranges in standard in 2015 and it only made its way in c++20.

Is it done to make the compiler developers work on supporting them, therefore making it more stable, or to increase awareness that such libraries exist? I'm just curious as I feel like missing a big part of reasoning)
