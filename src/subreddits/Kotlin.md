Hi everyone,

 I finished the [Build a Kotling Spring Application with Google Cloud Platform](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spring-cloud-gcp-kotlin/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) tutorial, where we create an application that accepts registrants information, publishes it to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic,  and persists this to a Cloud MySQL database. 

It is all fine but now I would like to remove registrants from the database and I don't know how to proceed. Either from the all registrants page or creating a new page that takes an input like last name to remove the registrant.

Can anyone help me?

Hello everyone!  


i've spent a few days prospecting on how kotlin would behave on enterprise java development, with clear separation between app server resources and application resources, jndi context and so on.  


Heavily inspired by [this article](https://vorozco.com/blog/2019/2019-04-17-Evaluating-Kotlin-caveats-JavaEE.html), i've built [this sample project](https://github.com/sombriks/sample-jee-kotlin) and i'm looking for feedback and also to hear other experiences like this one.

Has anyone had better luck with other IDEs hather intellij ultimate?

Any suggestions on what the showcase should cover?

Please share your toughts.

I am still learning Kotlin and few times I don't know how to write it in Kotlin although I know in Java. So what I do is, I have a Java class in my project (don't push this to your repository) and I write the code there, then copy Java code and paste it to Kotlin file and voila Android Studio helps converting it and you learn new thing at same time too!

I welcome more tips!

## [10][Abstract or Open Class for Parent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/fg6x6c/abstract_or_open_class_for_parent/)

I'm new to Kotlin, so I appreciate any help with what I'm guessing is a somewhat dumb question.

**Context**: I have a parent class that has a few child data classes. The parent and all children simply hold data and should never have their own methods. Another package (in Java) converts data into these classes. The parent class itself will never be converted from data to class; only the child classes will be.

**Question**: Is it better to have the parent class be an abstract class or an open class? Why?
