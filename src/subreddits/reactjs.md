We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello.

Yes, another problem .. üòÖ

I'm using the following docs page

[https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)

However there's a difference, I'm using an object URL which has shrugs/parts in it

```js
const [dataSet, setDataSet] = useState({
 users: [],
 posts: []
})

const URL = {
 posts: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts",
 users: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
};

```

And I want my data to get fetched with useEffect()
If I use:

```js
useEffect(() =&gt; {
 const newDataSet = {...dataSet } 
 ...
 fetch(URL.posts)
 ...
 newDataSet.posts = [...posts]
setDataSet(newDataSet)
}, [])
```

React says that that useEffect requires the URL &amp; data as a dependencies.

However I ran into infinite loops, crashes and fetching data from the server without stopping.

Here's a code sandbox where I have more questions in my comments:

Hello React Community 

I am currently working on a open source project called Reactrix , it's provides a convenient method \`useValidate\` to validate incoming data with a variety of powerful validation rules.

## [9][How to handle many state changes in react? App feels laggy](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iywtsl/how_to_handle_many_state_changes_in_react_app/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iywtsl/how_to_handle_many_state_changes_in_react_app/
---
Hello, 

I¬¥m currently working on a project where i have a editable component ( dragging, rotating, translatingX ...). All the changes will be reflected in a preview canvas. So if I move my editable div, the element in the canvas also gets moved. I manage the state in a parent component (childs are the editable component and the canvasPreview, and a few more).  I update the state on every change to editable component, and then all child components get rerendered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow the app seems to be laggy. I¬¥m thinking about adding the useMemo hook to revent unnessecary rerenders.

&amp;#x200B;

Does my explanation make sense?
## [10][For portfolio projects, is heroku for backend &amp; netlify for frontend enough?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iywf3i/for_portfolio_projects_is_heroku_for_backend/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iywf3i/for_portfolio_projects_is_heroku_for_backend/

Hi there,

As you know, Heroku suspend apps after 30 mins or so, then it has to be loaded once to get normal load speed for another 30 mins. 

Would it leave bad impression on portfolio projects? Do employers even click link &amp; check respective projects? (Because I will provide screenshots in github repo &amp; portfolio site)

 Would it be ok, if it loads for such long time? Frontend is fast enough (because it's on netlify), but slow loading on nodejs heroku makes it ugly.


I can't afford any paid service at the moment, even if it may seem cheap to you in US. (I'm in South Asia)
