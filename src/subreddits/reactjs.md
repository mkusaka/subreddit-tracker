We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I've joined a new team where we're basically rewriting a large scale production application using React. At a high level, this application works on live data input by multiple sources and shares data across several different components.

The project is just my manager and I, but there may be several engineers touching it in the future. We want to establish a solid framework for the app before diving in. I used React two years ago and used primarily MERN stack (react, redux, nodejs, with Flow), but only as an intern.

I was thinking of the following:

- Typescript for static type checking
- Styled components for CSS
- Redux for state management? I've always found Redux to be great but am wondering if there's something better to be used
- react-router for routing 

Also, I'm looking for pointers on how to compartmentalize business logic/API calls in applications from components themselves. I've originally used Redux for this (using thunk to do things like api calls), but I'm wondering if there is a practice I should adapt for this. For example, in Android there is the View-ViewModel pattern where the View is very dumb and the ViewModel is an entity handles all business logic that the view subscribes to; I'd like to do this with React.

Hey React Community,

I've been working with AngularJS and Angular for the last 5.5 years and only been doing frontend work. My goal is to learn React and some backend technologies to become a full-stack developer.

I am almost finished with Wes Bos' 'React For Beginners' course and starting to look for a course that builds a full-stack app (then go build my own!). Two courses are sticking out for me:

Wes Bos: [Fullstack Advanced React &amp; GraphQL course](https://advancedreact.com/)

and 

Newline: [Tinyhouse - A Fullstack React Masterclass](https://www.newline.co/tinyhouse)

My preference is to go through a course that builds a full-stack app. So I'm wondering if folks here have experience with either of these courses and/or have suggestions?

Thanks!

 [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional\_chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) 

Will babel transpile this for browsers that doesn't support it?

Anyone using it already, regardless?

Hi all,

I'm trying to add a simple secured contact form on my next.js app, without any success.. I've tried to follow this tutorial from Vercel ([https://docs-git-success-185-add-nextjs-sengrid-guide.zeit.now.sh/guides/deploying-nextjs-nodejs-and-sendgrid-with-zeit-now](https://docs-git-success-185-add-nextjs-sengrid-guide.zeit.now.sh/guides/deploying-nextjs-nodejs-and-sendgrid-with-zeit-now)) but when i try to use the contact form, i'm getting errors in the console (error 500, error 502 or error 503).

Can anyone explains to me how to add a free contact form, using Sendgrid or anything else, that i can deploy on vercel? It's the first time i try to do this, and i've already spent 6 hours trying multiple things without success...

Thanks a lot!
