This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I've been playing with Jetpack Compose the past few months so decided to release a project that shows examples of how you would do common Android things the Jetpack Compose way. Each example is fairly self contained and the hope is that you can learn Compose by just going through the examples and reading through the comments.

Github - [https://github.com/vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example](https://github.com/vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example)  


Here are some examples that I cover (there are a lot more examples!) -

&amp;#x200B;

[Shared some more context in this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/vinaygaba/status/1246918230439911425)

My plan with this project is to keep adding more examples as I learn new things about Compose. I'll also happily welcome feedback/contributions so if you find something wrong or are hoping to contribute to the project, just send a pull request!

My first app, a chess game, has been published two days ago, and it has zero downloads by random people. I know that Google doesn't always recommend apps at the beggining, but I'm just wondering about your experience. How long did it take for your games/apps to be downloaded by random people?

Edit: the link to my game is  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LMProgramming.Chessbutmess](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LMProgramming.Chessbutmess) , if you wan't to check it out.

Is there a drop in revenue? How are you and your company working? Is your productivity and long term goals somehow affected?

On my side, despite increase of installs revenue is dropping due to decreasing fill rates, productivity is gone because of uncertainty of what will happen with economy and ads.

I recently had an app removed for "impersonation" so I wanted to change the title as well as the description to make it clear that I was not affiliated with the entity. I went to the store listing tab to find it empty, as well as all other tabs; I could not make any changes. I made an appeal saying I agree with their decision and I would like to fix it but I can't. After a week of review I get an email back explaining what impersonation is and telling me to fix it. I can't take the Google team seriously anymore

Hi All

Newbie here. In college I previously used unity to create a side scroller game and found unity great to use.

I am now looking to develop an android game. More specifically a 2D multiplayer card game based off  of a popular card game here in my country. 

Is unity the platform to use here or does anyone have any other suggestions?

Thanks for your help in advance.

I just graduated last year October and was hired as an Android Developer on the same year November. I don't have much experience but I am willing to learn on new things. In my current work, there is no android app project yet so they allowed me to help with other teams working on a website. So I don't really count it as an experience.  


I'm currently working from home due to coronavirus. And I received a project from a restaurant (not client project from my company). This is my first time working on an actual project. I've made projects before but for thesis. Can you help me out? I'm really new to this. Here are my questions:  


How much should I ask for the price?  
Should I ask for money before? After? Or in the middle when I'm almost finished?  
Is there a contract? Should the developers make it? Or our client?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for your reply.
