## [4][Rails 6 and parallel tests: get ID/number of current executor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gqtb9m/rails_6_and_parallel_tests_get_idnumber_of/)

I need to try something with Capybara to attempt to solve an issueand I need to set a different server port for each executor when I am using parallel tests. With old parallelisation gems you could use the env variable TEST_ENV_NUMBER to get a different number for each executor process, but that doesn't seem to work with Rails' own parallel tests and I can't find anything similar. Any idea? Thanks

I'm rather new to using ruby so I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. I have received an asciidoctor document and I need to convert it to either html. or pdf to make it readable. I have been advised to use Ruby API for that but so far I have been unsuccessful in doing that (once I try running it I get an error saying "Failed to load AsciiDoc document - source is either binary or contains invalid Unicode data"). Could someone direct me on to the right track?

In 2005, DHH showed how to build a blog engine with Ruby on Rails. That demo spurred a movement in web development and changed the industry. Today, I would like to revisit the "Whoops!" video from an opposite approach. While DHH was calling the viewers to "look at all the code I'm not writing", I would like to explore the possibility of writing it all. Yes, let's write S-expressions from the presentation layer down to the SQL one, and contemplate the gains of being forced to understand the stack.
