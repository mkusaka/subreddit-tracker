Just found rubymonk, and it's hands down the best resource to learn Ruby. Are there any plans to open source it or at least transform into a text form so that the knowledge is not lost? 

Tagging /u/kaiwren, but it seems he hasn't been active for three years.

Youtube-dl is used to download videos from youtube and several other sites. I was trying to download a few videos for my Pluralsight account the other day but found there were a ton of issues, at least on Ubuntu 20.04. I  made a small plug-in for youtube-dl specific to Pluralsight to save people time if you need to download some videos for offline use. Thought I'd share it here.
