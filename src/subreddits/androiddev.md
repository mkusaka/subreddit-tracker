* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I have been using wireless debugging.

Is there any way to turn on wireless debugging automatically when the device connects to a trusted network again?

I have also look for the developer options API to turn the wireless debugging on automatically. So I can make quick tile. However, API is not available for the wireless debugging. In addition, setting search history deleted after some time (1 or 2 days.) and no shortcut available for the wireless debugging. :(

I'm in the process of learning Android Development and I love it. A lot to learn, for sure, but who cares when Android Studio has drag-and-drop and Kotlin is a genuinely fun language. But I keep hearing and reading stuff about Jetpack.

Out of everything I've read, which is mainly from the Android Developer website, Jetpack makes Android Development a lot easier and more concise. Well, except for one guy on here who claimed is just isn't used much in the business world. So, I figured I'd ask you all.

Is Jetpack common in business today? Should I become familiar with it alongside Kotlin/XML? Thanks in advance for any input.

I was doing a comparison between the two version, when I noticed that the active users numbers in app list is different from the old version.  

I want to know which version has the most recently updated active users number?
