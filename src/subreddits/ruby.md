Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I made a mini-gem called [oops\_a\_rake](https://github.com/odlp/oops_a_rake) which I'd like to share. It lets you write Rake tasks as Ruby objects:

    class GreetingTask
      include OopsARake::Task
    
      description "An enthusiastic greeting"
    
      def call
        puts "Hello!"
      end
    end

This example would define a `greeting` task.

My motivation for writing this gem is to make testing Rake tasks easier ([more context](https://github.com/odlp/oops_a_rake#motivation)). I'd really appreciate any feedback or thoughts. Thanks!

Is there a website or something that lets your practice certain sections of ruby? For example if I want to test passing through classes, has many relationships, etc... is there a place I can practice just those til Iâ€™m confident to move onto the next section?

## [10][Can I run two versions of Ruby at the same time so old gem dependencies work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jr56kf/can_i_run_two_versions_of_ruby_at_the_same_time/)

I'm updating to Ruby 2.6 from 2.3, but some of my gem dependencies don't work in 2.6. I've been using URU to switch between Ruby versions and it got me thinking, are there any tools to run 2.3 and 2.6 at the same time with their associated gems?
