## Want Help with your Code?

1. **Improve your chances** by adding a minimal example with [JSFiddle][jsfiddle], [CodeSandbox][code sandbox], or [Stackblitz][stackblitz].
    - Describe what you want it to do, and things you've tried. Don't just post big blocks of code!
    - **[Formatting Code][wiki formatting code]** wiki shows how to format code in this thread.
1. **Pay it forward!** Answer questions even if there is already an answer. Other perspectives can be helpful to beginners. Also, there's no quicker way to learn than [being wrong on the Internet][being wrong on the internet].

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Today at 1PM ET on React Wednesday,  we‚Äôll chat with Ram ([@nparashuram](https://twitter.com/nparashuram)) and team from Facebook. Ram is an engineering manager on Oculus, where he works on the React Native companion app, and on the headset itself, using React VR.

As part of that work, Ram gets to play with [Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes), the JavaScript engine designed to help React Native apps start up fast. We plan on asking Ram and team important questions, like ‚ÄúIs working on VR as awesome as it sounds?‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúHow can I be cool like you when I grow up?‚Äù We‚Äôll probably ask questions about Hermes too.

The format is interview-style with show and tell.

Hey guys, so I'm using createAsyncActions to dispatch my actions, but the error selector is always displaying the previous state.  
for example if I entered a wrong username, it displays an empty snack cause the initial state Is undefined and so on

`const error = useSelector(selectError);`

`const status = useSelector(selectAuthentication);`

`const onSubmit = async¬†(data: object)¬†=&gt;¬†{`  
 `await dispatch(loginUser(data));`  
 `if¬†(status)¬†{`  
 `navigation.navigate('Home');`  
¬†¬†¬†¬†`}`  
 `setSnack({¬†visible:¬†true,¬†msg:¬†error¬†});`  
¬†¬†`};`

I am quite new to react, learning it. I was going through [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org) for some study and found this to be confusing. How is the code (dark background) calls setState multiple times?
