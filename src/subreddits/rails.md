I am about to deploy this project : [http://github.com/prp-e/dakhlokharj](http://github.com/prp-e/dakhlokharj) using docker (and my dockerfile is attached to the repository). I create a docker image and run it, it seems fine until I want to work on its sign up/login. 

When I want to sign up, it loads everything and seems works fine with captcha and even the database, but when it comes to the confirmation email, it gives me that error. What's the problem here?

Hello, I'm currently at the last semester and I would like some thoughts of you guys about the web application that was requested by one of my professors.

Why I'm posting this ? 

It has almost 2 months that I have studying Ruby and I quite having a hard time to fully understand Rails. Before starting with Ruby, I had done so far a simple CRUD MVC in pure PHP. So, It's quite hard for me to grasp what I can done by myself  without following tutorials of others applications.

So, I would like to share the application Functional requirement and maybe someone could give me a brief guidence and gem recomendation for lightweight purposes for the first version of this application.

\- The application its a sharing videos system (channels)

Descrption: A plataform where professors can create many channels and post their videos. The professor has the power to validate (choose) which student can join their channel and see the videos. Student can make commentaries on a video.

So, there only two types of users. Professors and Students.

Functional Requirements:

*  Professors and Students registration and login
* Professors can create many channels and post many videos they want. (Professor X minister two curses, so he need to create two channel)
* Professors can add/invite students that its already on the plataform (I think It could have a search bar and the professors could search by name and invite students)
* Students can make commentaries on a video.

Its pretty just that. I could easily think important and cool functionality to add like a blog space in each channel (since each channel represent each course a professor is teaching) where they can add supporting content for the videos.

How could I start ? What should I search for beforehand ?

I already had draw a database schema and thought about the tables and columns.

From [https://medium.com/@rfleury2/a-quick-guide-to-model-errors-in-rails-965e2be3ac93](https://medium.com/@rfleury2/a-quick-guide-to-model-errors-in-rails-965e2be3ac93) this article I know that once a model is derived from `ActiveRecord::Base` it will have access to `ActiveModel::Errors` object which gets populated in case of validation or if we manually insert into it using `class.errors.add()` syntax.I want to know if there are any other ways that `ActiveModel::Errors` will be populated? Like when there is a rollback when that model is being saved and so on. Or when `update_attributes` is called on the model and so on

I'm working on an Android app that will be connected to a Rails backend. I would like the user to sign in once for the entire duration that they use the app - potentially for years. Because of this, I want to use sessions, so that access can be revoked. My thinking was to use a JWT that would contain a session ID, which would correspond to a column in a session table in the database. There would also be a 'is_valid' attribute, so that the session could be disabled.

Is that a good/safe/smart way to do what I need? I've been researching this for a few hours and can't find much on it. I've seen that some people will have a short-lived token that refreshes itself, but if the user doesn't use the app for a few days they would be logged out.

Greetings folks,

I'm new to Devise, and so far it's been really cool to learn and work with. I'm building a Rails app that has a React front-end, and I'm developing the API for the front-end to check if a logged in user is an Admin.

I have this React code that hits a "is_admin method"


       componentWillMount(){
         this.checkIfUserIsAdmin();
       }

       checkIfUserIsAdmin() {
         const url = "http://localhost:3000/users/is_admin";

         const token = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content;
         console.log(token)
         fetch(url, {
           method: "GET",
           headers: {
             "X-CSRF-Token": token,
             "Content-Type": "application/json"
           }
         })
           .then(response =&gt; {
             if (response.ok) {
               return response.json();
             }
             throw new Error("Network response was not ok.");
           })
           .catch(error =&gt; console.log(error.message));
           //eventually this will update the component state depending on the response
       }

The API seems to be hitting the proper end point just fine, but I am getting the response from the server:

     Started GET "/users/is_admin" for ::1 at 2020-03-02 14:59:05 -0800
     Processing by SessionsController#is_admin as */*
       Parameters: {"session"=&gt;{}}
     Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 2ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Allocations: 1235)


  
     NoMethodError (undefined method `admin?' for nil:NilClass):

This seems to indicate that there is no"user" for Devise to check if admin on. This would make sense as I'm not passing anything to ID the user to the Rails method from React. I was under the impression that Devise would manage the session, and that passing the CSRF token would be enough.

What would be the proper way to work this out? Should I first get the logged in user's data, and then set @user to the result of that?

Hi all,

So I have a button which will order my search results by rating:

    &lt;%= link_to 'Top rated', coffee_shops_path(:order_by =&gt; "rating") %&gt;

This goes to my coffee\_shops#index controller, where I call another method if an order\_by param is given, called order\_coffee\_shops\_by\_param:

    def order_coffee_shops_by_param(coffee_shops, param)
      if param == "rating"
        @coffee_shops = @coffee_shops.order("#{param} DESC NULLS LAST")
      end
    end

The problem is, I'm losing all my other params in this process. Everything that was already in the URL string is being lost. So rather than this just reorganising all the results that are already on the page, it's doing a clean search, returning all results, and then ordering these results. My params look like this.

    &lt;ActionController::Parameters {"order_by"=&gt;"rating", "controller"=&gt;"coffee_shops", "action"=&gt;"index"} permitted: false&gt;

I've tried doing this using [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2695538/add-querystring-parameters-to-link-to) but I just get the error:

    unable to convert unpermitted parameters to hash

Help appreciated as always.

At my job we will make an API (no JSON API, just old school REST) and a Front-end app to break down an old web app we have. I want it to be as fast and less memory consuming as possible. From what I've researched I think [panko_serializer](https://github.com/yosiat/panko_serializer) and [blueprinter](https://github.com/procore/blueprinter) are both solid choices. But I don't know if there's another one that's even better.

Greetings.

Folks,

I have a pretty large React app that is backed by a relatively vanilla Rails app. A few years ago, I converted it to use Webpacker from the very first day it was released. I've been keeping with upgrading it, but feel that its getting problematic due to the size of my application. 

In terms of UI, there are about 10 separate packs files which are all individual react applications that map to different sections of the site. It seems that compile times have become slower and slower as the number of packs has grown. Additionally, on every save, all packs are compiled even though changes to a single one are made. Is there no way around this? I've been able to setup some code splitting so that everything coming from node\_modules is placed into a separate chunk, but things still seem slow during development.

My question is... has anyone here with large client side apps experienced the same...and what did you do? Should i be looking to ditch webpacker and just start hand rolling some optimized custom webpack configuration solution?  I personally hate dealing with webpack config and would love to avoid it, but not sure if that is just a pipedream.  Do any of you have examples of webpack / webpacker configurations that could be useful for me to look through? Thanks all

I'm having a strange issue where my Rails 6/React app renders fine in development using \`bin/webpack-dev-server\` but fails in production using \`RAILS\_ENV=production assets:precompile\` and \`rails s -e production\`. It's as if the JSX no longer is recognized and view as a syntax error.

As the title says, when i try to run the $rails server command and   
preview running application, it tells me "Oops, VFS Connection does not   
exist". Any way to fix this?
