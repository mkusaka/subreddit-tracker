Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

ðŸ‘‹ Hey guys!

My name is Michael Aubry. I live in San Diego and I've spent the last 8 months coding a video editor. I wanted something that was like After Effects in essence but abstracted some details and made creating stunning content a breeze. I was tired of having an overly complex toolset to create simple videos like the beginning of my tutorial video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=2&amp;v=J\_g38fHHvzA&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=J_g38fHHvzA&amp;feature=emb_title) or the intro to my buddies YouTube video [https://youtu.be/fERlt5pTxu8?t=11](https://youtu.be/fERlt5pTxu8?t=11). 

I didn't like a lot of the generic-looking solutions that were built without any soul. The videos from some solutions come out looking cheesy. I want videos in [https://storycreatorapp.com/](https://storycreatorapp.com/) to be easy to make but hard to make badly. I'm solving this with carefully selected elements. Premium templates modeled after sexy content.

You might be saying to yourself *"I am just interested in learning about React.js though"*. So I digress with the intro. Let me make this post mostly about the React.js code. If you want to check it out and play around then here is a direct link (**it's FREE**) [https://storycreatorapp.com/](https://storycreatorapp.com/). Just looking for feedback before I launch on Product Hunt and spend money on advertising.

Ok, so I am using TypeScript to reduce bugs. I believe this is a great practice. It can be overkill in making an MVP but I would do it to set a good foundation. You can use \`any\` and come back after features are validated to tighten them up. Most engineers would throw up at \`any\` but that's why they're not building companies, just working at them. Ship code, and ship as fast as you can while still having a good foundation to build on top of. That is my philosophy, I am just learning like anyone, and admit I can be wrong. This is just how I see it.

If you explore the app you will see an "artboard". Let me talk about how I built the "artboard". I am using Dan Abramov's DND library [https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about). It's very powerful, it can be a little intimidating and has a learning curve. This definitely extended the release date but it was worth it to me. I wanted full control over DND. Not a premade solution using canvas. I was inspired to build this UX similar to Canva. I thought they did an amazing job.

My criteria for the "artboard" is that when it's "active" and draggable. It should hide the selected object as the object leaves the canvas, but the "active" box should always be visible. In order to do this, I have one DragLayer that sends its x,y coordinates to the store DND uses under the hood. Then I have another component for the "active border" that has "pointer-events: none" and moves with the draggable object. It's at a position in the DOM hierarchy where it's visible outside the canvas. Where the draggable element is at a position in the DOM hierarchy where it's parent element is the canvas set to "overflow:hidden". I have tricks and hacks for manipulating the x,y for performance.

Not sure if I am boring you so I'll start to wrap up and answer more questions in the comments. I'll conclude this by talking briefly about the timeline. The timeline wasn't initially in the first release, but as I thought about it. I realized it's an extremely important component in producing an interesting unique video with limitless combinations. I wanted to unleash the users' creativity and give them enough flexibility. Without it being overly complex. After Effects has a timeline where there can be unlimited layers. Inside each layer, you can go down a rabbit hole and feel overwhelmed. It's extremely powerful, don't get me wrong. However, I believed some users want something simple. That's exactly what I did. Initially, I had unlimited layers. After talking to some users I decided to make all media in one track, audio in its own track, and text on its own. Soon will be coming elements.

With this feature, I am actually using [https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd). It was just easier out of the box and didn't have as many requirements as the "artboard". All the states are managed using React Apollo. The whole video editor is wrapped in Apollo actually. I am persisting the video data into apollo and syncing it to the server.

If this doesn't bore you and you would like to learn more. I am happy to answer questions and share in the comments below.

Best,

## [5][Why is Redux necessary?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/favlhe/why_is_redux_necessary/)

---
I am absolutely confused by Redux/React-Redux and I'm hoping someone could help let me know what makes it necessary to learn it over what's already easy in react's state management.

I've been looking at job postings and they require knowledge of redux so I figured I'd try to get familiar with it and chose to watch this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xoEpnmhxnk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xoEpnmhxnk)

It seems overly complicated for what could be done easily.Simply:

`const [variable, setVariable] = useState(defaultValue)And then what's inside component for onChange={ e =&gt; {setVariable(newValue) } }`

So really, what makes redux so special? I don't get it.  


  
EDIT:   
Thanks everyone for the discussion on Redux! From what I can see is that it's more for complex apps where managing the state becomes complicated and Redux helps simplify that.   
There are alternatives and even an easier way to do Redux with Redux Toolkit!   
Good to know!   
I was actually convinced to put it in my current app.

Hey, I'm using antd upload component to upload file to AWS but unable to understand which item gives the actual file that is to be send . Below is my code. Any help will be useful.

Upload Component - 

    const props = {
      name: 'file',
      multiple: true,
      action: 'https://www.mocky.io/v2/5cc8019d300000980a055e76',
      onChange(info) {
        const { status } = info.file;
        if (status !== 'uploading') {
          console.log(info.file, info.fileList);
        }
        if (status === 'done') {
          message.success(`${info.file.name} file uploaded successfully.`);
        } else if (status === 'error') {
          message.error(`${info.file.name} file upload failed.`);
        }
      },
    };
    
    ReactDOM.render(
      &lt;Dragger {...props}&gt;
        &lt;p className="ant-upload-drag-icon"&gt;
          &lt;InboxOutlined /&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p className="ant-upload-text"&gt;Click or drag file to this area to upload&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p className="ant-upload-hint"&gt;
          Support for a single or bulk upload. Strictly prohibit from uploading company data or other
          band files
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/Dragger&gt;,

Hi everyone, could someone help me with deploying a react app on github pages? I've done it before, but this time something doesnt work.

So I deployed a react app on github pages using npm run deploy  
 and the website on github pages is blank and it has no errors. It works well on localhost. I checked the name in package.json and it is the same name.

This is the source with code: [https://github.com/MichalKoscinski/Portfolio-Website](https://github.com/MichalKoscinski/Portfolio-Website)

This is the website it should deploy to: [https://michalkoscinski.github.io/Portfolio-Website/](https://michalkoscinski.github.io/Portfolio-Website/)

Greetings, everyone!

I made an online shop with React (no backend). I started building it with almost zero practical React knowledge. It took me around 5 months. I learned tons of stuff for this time!

In the README on GitHub you can find links to the dependencies and CDNs. There are also list of all tools that I used to create this demo with links to the code in project.

If you'll find any bugs, please, let me know!
