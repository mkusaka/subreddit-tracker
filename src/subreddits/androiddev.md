We’re the Android engineering team, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on [r/androiddev](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/) next week, on **July 9th**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), where next week we’re diving deep into Android 11 Compatibility, with a look at some of the new tools and milestones. As part of the week, we’re hosting an AMA on the recent updates we’ve made to the platform in Android 11.

This is your chance to ask us *technical* questions related to Android 11 features and changes. Please note that we want to keep the conversation focused strictly on the engineering of the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, July 9 at 12:00 PM PST / 3:00 PM EST (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PST / 4:20 PM EST. **Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time**. This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I am developing an android app which will show list of YouTube videos from my custom JSON file and I want to play those videos in EXO player. But I am not sure about the restrictions.
1. Like can I fetch videos using my custom list?
2. Using Exo player and publishing on Play Store is allowed?
If someone have any experience, Please let me know also.

Are cross platform apps in scope of this subreddit, or is r/androiddev only for Android-only apps? 

Also, do you develop for Android only or for cross platform?
