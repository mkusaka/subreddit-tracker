I don't know if it's appropriate to post this here or not, I just created a software on go that manages expiration for sets/list fields. Redis doesn't add such functionality (I researched about that and found out that it's because they don't want to add more complexity, I might be wrong on my research tho). I needed such functionality in a project I was working on and made such a microservice and made it open source for everyone's use. It's not documented yet and doesn't even have a license yet but you can probably understand how it works by looking at code and the proto file. It uses gRPC for communication. It's my first open source project so I'd appreciate any comments about that. [Here is the code](https://gitlab.com/ShapedHorizon/redis-set-list-expiration-manager)

Hi GO community! This is my first attempt at recording a GO tutorial series [you can find the playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxFwlLOncxFILf0gyA7CE1g6uuwxfImpe). 

The plan is to create a series of small projects roughly 10minutes each in length (no more than 20mins) which will leave you with a working application at the end of the video. I will be releasing a video every other week, 3 videos staged and ready to go. The projects will usually leave some loose ends so that you can improve and/or expand on the project yourself, I will discuss some ideas at the end of each video.

I understand this level of teaching will probably be below most members of this subreddit but hopefully, you might pick up a few ideas along the way or fill some time during the lockdown. 

The first video shows you how to [convert a text file to a PDF file using GO](https://youtu.be/STS1Oy1hUFc). The skills shown should give you enough knowledge to create PDF files from other data sources.

If anyone can provide any feedback on improvements or ideas for more projects that will be most helpful.

You can also [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/pDigitalUK) if you wish where I will tweet out updates when new GO projects videos are added.
