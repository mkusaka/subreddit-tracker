Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Since C++11, I noticed that programmers in some circles started using `std::shared_ptr` for everything (possibly type-aliasing it as e.g.`Ptr`) and passing everything by `shared_ptr` copy, but this makes me personally uneasy due to the loss in visibility into RAII-based resource release times.

Unfortunately, I'm not good at coming up with the kind of concrete arguments that truly speak to people, so to say, so here I am.

Most notably, I'm having a hard time conveying why destruction times are Importantâ„¢, and why you don't want your object relationships to turn into a strongly connected graph.

What's your guys' take? How would you (amiably) approach the issue?

Edit: Thank you all for the responses! I didn't go through quite all of them yet, but I will over the next day or so. I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, but I'm happy that it did :)
## [9][Macro for accessors methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hvor0t/macro_for_accessors_methods/)

Hello,

In a new project where I am working now there are a lot of macros that help to write accessors and other things.
As example you can write GETSET(int, counter) in a class definition an the macro will exapnds into the code of set / get and member definition.
I don't like very much this but you don't have to write a lot of trivial code.

What do you think? Is it a bad practice? Or you like this approach?

I am using g++ through terminal, it works fine for small projects but for complicated project like that using cmake , g++ gave me little choices compared to VS on Windows. What is the best IDE to use in Ubuntu?
