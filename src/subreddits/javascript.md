Hello fellow devs!

So yesterday I spent some time wondering if I am loosing my mind.  
  
Depending on if I evaluated a regex even or odd times, the result flipped,   
leading to me weirding out about js once more.  


Here is my code example I used in the chrome console to reproduce the behavior. 
  
 
    CHROME CONSOLE
    var re = /^jsWTF$/g // or var re = new RegExp( /^jsWTF$/g), same result
    re.test("jsWTF")       
    &gt; true
    re.test("jsWTF")
    &gt; false
    re.test("jsWTF")
    &gt; true
    re.test("jsWTF")
    &gt; false

You'll see the result flips between ```true``` and ```false``` with every evaluation.  
In the Firefox console, the expression gets conveniently evaluated immediately after writing the ```re.test("jsWTF")``` and is shown as preview, so after pressing enter, the wrong result is returned everytime.

 
    FIREFOX CONSOLE 
    var re = /^jsWTF$/g // or var re = new RegExp( /^jsWTF$/g), same result
    re.test("jsWTF")       
    &gt; false
    re.test("jsWTF")
    &gt; false
    re.test("jsWTF")
    &gt; false
    re.test("jsWTF")
    &gt; false
 

I am sure there is some kind of ***js-logical*** explanation for this, and I am extremely curious about it!  
Can somebody point me in the right direction?  

Thanks in advance!!
