We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Title says it all. I felt it was pretty impressive and it was a problem that has kept me up for 3 nights now, so a real code high when it finally worked. I just wanted to tell someone who is actually in tech and doesn't look at me like "cool so what".

When looking for react packages I always struggle to decide for one because I am afraid that in a year or two the package will become obsolete, stop working or anything else happens. There are packages for everything but often enough I decided to implement something myself instead of browsing through all the packages available.

What's the best practice/how do you decide if you choose this one package instead of implementing it yourself?

Hi Guys, Iâ€™ve been developing with React a few months now and Iâ€™m feeling fairly comfortable working with it.

I originally learnt from  [Stephen Griders React course ](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) on Udemy and I thought it was excellent, it gave me a great understanding of the fundamentals and enough information to get me up and running. I then bought his [Advanced React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux-tutorial/) course however I quickly found that testing element was out of date, and the subsequent categories relied on you having completed the first section so I refunded it.

Iâ€™d be really interested in finding a course that has some more advanced features in React such as 

- Custom hooks (does this replace HOC?)
- Suspense (I know itâ€™s not fully released yet)
- Server side rendering
- CSS in JS (styled components maybe)
- Graph QL

The list above is just a general outline and Iâ€™d be really interested in seeing recommendations from you guys 

Thanks in advance!

    import React from 'react';
    
    
    const Weather = (props) =&gt; {
    
      function minmaxTemp(min,max) {
      return(
          &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;span className="px-4"&gt;{min}&amp;deg;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span className="px-4"&gt;{max}&amp;deg;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/h3&gt;
          );
        }
    
      return(
    
        &lt;div className="container text-light"&gt;
          &lt;div className="cards pt-4"&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;  {props.city}, {props.country} &lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;h5 className="py-4"&gt;
    
            &lt;i className={`wi ${props.weatherIcon} display-1`}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    
          &lt;/h5&gt;
    
          &lt;span className="py-2"&gt;{props.temp_celsius}&amp;deg;&lt;/span&gt;
    
          {/*  show min and max temp*/}
    
           {minmaxTemp(props.temp_min, props.temp_max)}
    
           &lt;h3 className="py-3"&gt; {props.description} &lt;/h3&gt;
    
          &lt;/div&gt;
