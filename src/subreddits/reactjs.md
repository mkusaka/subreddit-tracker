As the title says.

I noticed that there are codelines in project that I got that looks like this:

    export const FooComponent = (props: FooProps) =&gt; {
      const { id } = props;
    
      return (&lt;div&gt;{props.id}&lt;/div&gt;);
    }

What is the difference between:

    export const FooComponent = (props: FooProps) =&gt; {
      return (&lt;div&gt;{props.id}&lt;/div&gt;);
    }

This is a redux project so I guess its related to mutability of the vars.

Hey, guys, I'm planning to learn JEST and TDD in React, can you please give any tips and recommendations? I've never written any test and am very new to testing.

The title.

So I've picked up React on the job. There are a lot of things which I like in particular. First, very wide ecosystem. Things like material-ui for example really cuts down the development costs and allows to rapidly build decent looking UI's while also providing design guidelines unlike common component libraries.

I particularly like Redux and how it enforces explicit structure. While it can be a bit unwieldy for smaller  tasks, it's godsent when it comes to debugging a complex application.

And I really appreciate JSX. Liked it from day one actually. Although perhaps angular 1.x left a bit of a bitter aftertaste in regards to html directives with fluff syntax on top which pretends to be html, but isn't.

I really like how it doesn't concern itself with classes all that much as a structural unit of code which is very prevalent in programming. IMO, often out of mare habit or syntactic familiarity rather than some pragmatic benefit.

However, having written a few non trivial applications and having one more down the pipelines to come, I'm not exactly thrilled about some of library features. Namely, how it stupidly rerenders everything down the component tree by default having you always explicitly marking not to rerender. Gotcha with PureComponent back in classes, memo everything by default when it comes to functional. Should component update / memo second argument when it comes to functional components on more complex cases. When I feel that the opposite should be true or some kind of reactivity would be more sensible approach.

Hooks feels like an improvement, but ultimately end up like surrogate for actual FRP. Now it's yet too difficult to draw conclusions, the jury is still out of how it will eventually work out. 

What are your gripes with the library you wish it did a bit differently if it could?
