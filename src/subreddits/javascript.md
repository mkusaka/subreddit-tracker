Post a link to a GitHub repo that you would like to have reviewed, and brace yourself for the comments!
Whether you're a junior wanting your code sharpened or a senior interested in giving some feedback and have some time to spare, 
this is the place.

## [4][[AskJS] How important is it to check in a lock file? i.e. yarn.lock or package-lock.json](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/hbvwmx/askjs_how_important_is_it_to_check_in_a_lock_file/)

I was talking to the lead engineer of a project that chooses not to check in their lock file (for their monorepo). He reasons that it "causes issues with merging/rebasing, and it pollutes diffs with tons of unimportant changes." And that major projects like [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) and [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) don't check them in either.

This makes me a bit conflicted because it is officially [recommended](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/lockfiles-for-all/) by Yarn and a large [majority](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44206782/do-i-commit-the-package-lock-json-file-created-by-npm-5) on StackOverflow seem to be in favour of it (although to be fair, many also [disagree](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44206782/do-i-commit-the-package-lock-json-file-created-by-npm-5#comment78284962_44210813)).

The most practical line of reasoning from the lead is that "we've never had any serious problems leaving it out." And that if we were concerned about certain versions that break our code, we should lock down those versions explicitly in the `package.json`.

I think those arguments are quite credible, but it feels really wrong to "buck the trend" of the vast majority of projects. What do you guys think? How important is it to check it in?
