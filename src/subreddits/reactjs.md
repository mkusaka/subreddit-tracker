If you are frustrated with learning convoluted form library API's then React Bare Forms is the quickest &amp; easiest library to get started with. There is zero learning curve, just cut and paste one of the examples and away you go!

Hi,

Any recommendations on how to configure ESLint and Prettier for a project which is going to be using React and Typescript. It looks like CRA has ESLint config but I am thinking that maybe it would make sense to override that. Any thoughts or recommendations? Thank you!

Hello there,

I have been researching on this topic the last few days but cant find a fitting solution yet.

I want to create a universal react component which will be included on several websites, which are partialy React only sites as well as HTML sites. Lets say its a Header with an specific design. It also will include some external npm packages and needs data from the HTML site.

For example:

    &lt;div 
        id="header"
        data="[
            {url:"./home.html", label:"Home"},
            {url:"./subpage.html", label:"Subpage"},
            ...
        ]"
        &gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The React component gets the content of the data field, can convert it into proper JSON and passes it into an component as props. Then the component gets rendered into the div.  
At least that was the idea but I cant find any solution in reality.   


Most examples I can find on google are basic ones like in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) but with that I cant import any other packages or pass data from the HTML element. I suppose I would need to compile the react somehow and include it into the HTML? Or is there a possibility to directly compile it into the existing HTML page?

Any help is appreciated!
## [8][SSR with VueJS vs. React (NuxtJS vs. NextJS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jn93uv/ssr_with_vuejs_vs_react_nuxtjs_vs_nextjs/)

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been developing my interfaces in Vue and I've been thinking of learning React. However, I want to explore the SSR options first so I've tried (very quickly) NuxtJS. For those of you who have experience with both Nuxt and Next, which one do you think is best ? In terms of fuctionality but also maturity of the framework (for example with Nuxt I've been struggling to do some super basic stuff like... import SVGs...).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.
## [9][Why use function components over class components for new projects ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jn7mfo/why_use_function_components_over_class_components/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jn7mfo/why_use_function_components_over_class_components/
---
So to me the syntax of class components (with typescript) has always been more readable than function components (probably because of my java and php background), 

but since react introduced hooks, function components are the default and apparently people find them easier to read and understand than class components.

I'm starting a new reactjs + TypeScript project and tried to integrate it with react query but since react query is used through hooks I would need some workaround to use these hooks in class components.

So right now I'm wondering if react query is worth the switch to function components or if I should just stick with class components and implement my own fetch logic, which is how I have been doing it in the last project. 

What do you guys think ?

Hi,  


super beginner with react-spring and svg's,,, and I can't wrap my head around how to animate the stroke on the following svg-path:  


`import React from 'react';`  
`import¬†{¬†useSpring,¬†animated¬†}¬†from 'react-spring';`  
`export default function LineAnimation(props)¬†{`  
 `const anim¬†=¬†useSpring(x:100 from:{x: 0});`  
 `return¬†(`  
 `&lt;animated.svg`   
 `style={{¬†position:¬†"absolute",¬†left:¬†"150px",¬†height:¬†"50px",¬†width:¬†"250px"¬†}}`   
 `strokeWidth="12"`   
 `strokeDashoffset={props.hover¬†?¬†anim.x¬†:¬†0}&gt;`  
 `&lt;path stroke="black" d="M0¬†20¬†H100" /&gt;`  
 `&lt;/animated.svg&gt;`  
¬†¬†`)`  
`};`
