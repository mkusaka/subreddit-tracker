I'm working on some notes from the standard library. And my goal is to compile them into a book. This is my work so far: [`https://github.com/blasrodri/spaceship-go`](https://github.com/blasrodri/spaceship-go)

Feel free to take a look, and comment :)

Thanks for your time!

Hi, I have created a gh blog about transition from JVM enterprise app development to Go. I divided it into bullet points that you most often have to address in this applications and how you can approach it Go.

Link : [https://github.com/gwalen/go-enterprise-app-dev](https://github.com/gwalen/go-enterprise-app-dev)

These are main subjects which I tried to evaluate:

1. Efficiently build rest-api
   1. Web frameworks
   2. Generate rest-api documentation (TBD)
2. DB access
   1. RDBMS
   2. NoSql (TBD)
3. Efficient and easy to use logging
4. Clear way for DI
5. Reactive programming libraries (streaming data)
6. Clear error handling
7. Concurrency as first class citizen
8. Code debugging and profiling
9. Testability
10. Communication with message brokers (TBD)
11. IDE support
12. Configure app using file or environment variables
13. Db migration tools

I would be grateful for your feedback. We can discus it here and create issues or PR in the repo so others making this kind of transformation could benefit from it.
## [6][CLI tool and Go lib to convert CRON expression to human readable text](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/ha15lf/cli_tool_and_go_lib_to_convert_cron_expression_to/)

Link to repo: [https://github.com/lnquy/cron](https://github.com/lnquy/cron).  

The library (cron) and the CLI tool (hcron) allows you to convert the CRON expression to human readable text.  
For example:
- `*/5 * * * *` =&gt; Every 5 minutes
- `0 30 10-13 ? * wed,FRI` =&gt; At 30 minutes past the hour, between 10:00 AM and 01:59 PM, only on Wednesday and Friday

The library has been originally ported from [cRonstrue](https://github.com/bradymholt/cRonstrue) JS to Go.  
Please show the original repo and author the love, too.

# Context

Visualizing backend concepts and learnings is difficult.

I recently released an eBook with an entirely open-sourced codebase on "How to build a blockchain from scratch in Go", but I feel like a lot of the interesting parts are not easily visible.

So, I was brainstorming over the last week, **how could I make the programmed components and concepts more... "user/dev friendly, easier to get started".**

# Tutorial

This is what i came up with, an **interactive tutorial:**

[https://web3.coach/blockchain/backend-tutorial](https://web3.coach/blockchain/backend-tutorial)

**For now it's very MVP-like** and I would like to know if you like this kind of style and find it helpful for understanding the concepts behind this OS codebase: [https://github.com/web3coach/the-blockchain-bar](https://github.com/web3coach/the-blockchain-bar)

What do you think? What would you add/change?

Hello! my name is Artem and I started my career as a programmer.

im learning golang and basics of computer science right now and doing an internship at one company. I'm looking for  open source  GO projects  to contribute

i know basics of go, SOA, microservices, have experience with mongo, postgres, redis. Unix-friendly.

done some projects with go (rest apis, microservices)

mine github name same as here.

Thank you all for your attention. Have a nice day!
