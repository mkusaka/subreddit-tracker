## [2][typecheck.macro - Automatically generate validation functions for Typescript types.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/glyq1m/typecheckmacro_automatically_generate_validation/)

10 days ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ges5r9/auto_generate_typechecker_from_typescript_types/) asking whether it was possible to automatically generate validation functions for Typescript types. Unfortunately, it seemed like that was not the case.

So I built a library (well, compile time macro) to do it: [https://github.com/vedantroy/typecheck.macro](https://github.com/vedantroy/typecheck.macro)

 Once you configure babel macros, you can seamlessly generate validation functions for your Typescript types. No need to write your types again in a DSL (like runtypes/zod/io-ts). Compile time macros automatically parse your type declarations and generate validation functions.

The library is pretty fresh, but it already handles unions/tuple types/optional types/index signatures/interfaces (no extending yet)/type aliases/generics/object patterns/arrays, so it's pretty functional/usable.

The resulting validation functions are also really fast because most other libraries (except ajv) don't do compile time code generation. After some bench marking (not that I'm a benchmarking expert), I found it was up to 3 times as fast as ajv.

This is my first open source library, so I'm excited to hear what you guys think!

Above all, I feel like this can be a community effort. I'm open to suggestions/any form of feedback/contribution/etc.

Hi, my requirement is upon refreshing or closing the browser tab, there should be my custom alert

instead of browser alert. I have to get this work done in typescript so I am returning the

$event.returnValue = false on beforeunload event which will stop my browser from closing or

refreshing but at the same time I want my custom pop-up to be shown instead of browser pop-up.

Here is my Code -

      @HostListener("window:beforeunload", ["$event"])
      beforeUnload($event: Event) {
    //loading my custom pop up
          $event.returnValue =false;
    }

 My Custom Pop-up loads but loads after I cancel the browser popup- 

&amp;#x200B;

[Browser Popup](https://preview.redd.it/93ls5ftj7hz41.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989a3847460893e33f634256c31fea49dab7824f)

 How can I achieve this? what am I doing wrong? Please help.
## [4][Is this the correct way to handle an input with a mask?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/gllnww/is_this_the_correct_way_to_handle_an_input_with_a/)

I'm creating a reusable text input (functional component). It's a simple text input. The input will have a phone prop that when it's true, it will add a phone mask to the value it returns to it's parent.

    return (
    &lt;input id={props.id} type={props.type} placeholder={props.placeholder} ref={ref} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;
    );

And the change is handled with this function:

    function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;) {

    // format phone mask if phone prop is true
    if(props.phone) {
      event.target.value = "phone mask will be added here";
    }

    if(props.onChange) { 
        props.onChange(event); 
    }
   }

What I'm trying to achieve is that the state of all the form values is handled by the parent of all inputs.

The input achieves that, but I feel it's kind of hacky to assign a value like that to event.target.value. It's about the second time I'm using typescript so I'm pretty this is not the correct way.

Any help?

I swear I something in io-ts that allows you to check whether an arbitrary object matches a io-ts type without the entire isLeft/isRight ceremony. Just a simple boolean value. Does anyone remember what this method in the library is?

I recently wrote a dynamodb library (https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb) that helps folks model their access patterns by supplying a schema and dynamically implementing an API for that schema. 

As an example, the user would  supply:

    const {Entity} = require("electrodb");
    const tasks = new Entity({
        attributes: {
            id: {
                type: "string",
                default: () =&gt; uuid()
            },
            user: {
                type: "string",
                required: true
            },
            project: {
                type: "string",
                required: true
            },
            name: {
                type: "string",
                required: true
            },
            description: {
                type: "string",
                required: false
            },
            isActive: {
                type: "boolean",
                required: true
            }
        },
        indexes: {
            task: {
                pk: {
                    field: "pk",
                    facets: ["id"]
                },
                sk: {
                    field: "sk",
                    facets: [""]
                }
            },
            assigned: {
                index: "gsi1pk-gsi1sk-index"
                pk: {
                    field: "gsi1pk",
                    facets: ["employee"]
                },
                sk: {
                    field: "gsi1sk",
                    facets: ["project", "id"]
                }
            }
        }
    })

The above example would yield an dynamic api implementing that model, for example:

    // "task" method comes from index "task." 
    // "id" comes from facets value "id" under pk.
    tasks.query.task({id: "1"}).go()

    // "assigned" method comes from index "assigned".
    // "user" comes from facets value "user" under pk.
    // "project" comes from facets value "project" under sk.
    tasks.query.assigned({user: "johnsmith"})
        .between(
            {project: "project-a"},
            {project: "project-z"})
        .go()
    
    // "description" property in required so no error expected.
    // "isActive" property is required but not included so error expected.
    tasks.put({
        id: "23", 
        project: "project",
        user: "johnsmith",
        name: "task1"
    }).go()

It feels like this sort of API isnt really something that could be implemented in typescript, but I'm interested in how close I could get. It feels like the only way I'd accomplish this would be to write some sort of interface generation tool to parse and build the interfaces for the user.

Very new to typescript. Been scratching my head on how to do in the right way for sometime now.

# Context

Im using hapijs, and was trying to setup the routes. The `server.route` method takes in a array of route configuration objects `&lt;ServerRoute[]&gt;`. In each of the `ServerRoute`, there is a property called `method` which has the following type

    /**
     * (required) the HTTP method. Typically one of 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', or 'OPTIONS'. Any HTTP method is allowed, except for 'HEAD'. Use '*' to match against any HTTP method.
     */
    method: Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL | Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL[] | string | string[];

where the `Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL` is:

    type HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL =
    'GET'
    | 'POST'
    | 'PUT'
    | 'PATCH'
    | 'DELETE'
    | 'OPTIONS'
    | HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL_LOWERCASE;

# What I have tried

This is how i create the routes:-

    server.route(&lt;ServerRoute[]&gt;[
        {
            "method": "GETzz", // here "GETzz" is not a valid UTIL.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL
            "path": "/",
            "handler": rootHandler().get,
        }
    ]);

I tried asserting by `"method": &lt;Util.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL&gt;"GETzz";`, which gives me auto-completions for that type inside quotes, but the value is still not checked to be part of `UTIL.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL` or not.

(Edit)But take this example:-

    type Methods = "valid1" | "valid2";
    const obj:{method:Methods} = {
            method: "inValidValue",
    }

The above would result in the error that i was hoping for, which's `Type '"inValidValue"' is not assignable to type 'Methods'.`

# Question

The question is how to enforce the property `method` to only be assigned values that exists in type `UTIL.HTTP_METHODS_PARTIAL`? Currently i can give any value like `GETzz` etc but still no error is thrown, until I run the server and a request is made to the corresponding `path`. The information from that error is unreadable and in no way helps in pointing out that, giving the value of `method` as `GETzz` is why the server failed.

(Edit)Is it a problem with the type definition files of hapijs in DefinitelyTyped?

(Edit)The issue can be solved by removing the \`string | string\[\]\` from the type definition for hapi from DefinitelyTyped as \`Util.HTTP\_METHODS\_PARTIAL\` already has all the necessary header methods. I'm not sure how good of a solution this is. But this temporary hack works.

How to solve that (I am using vscode):

1. eslint shows that I do not use **imported** types , despite the fact that I  use them.
2. eslint does shows error for types that I have **defined** but do not use, but when I hover over the unused type I see a ts error `"type" is declared but never used.ts(6196)`. However there is no red highlighting . Just the color of syntax highlighter is deem and is difficult to spot .

What I have done so far :

    npm install --save-dev eslint typescript
    npx eslint --init

I have choosen that I use typescript and esmodules and installed the extra packages suggested by eslint.

So when I compile a `.ts` file to a `.js` file and then run the `.js` file and get errors at line `x` column `y` I can not look at my `.ts` file at line `x` column `y` because the `.js` code has code at different places than the corresponding code in the `.ts` file . Is there any way to fix that?
