So what do I mean by concrete use cases? Example code showing patterns, workarounds, or any other _concrete_ examples of why you personally (or team, or project) would be excited for generics.

Why am I asking this? Outside of marshaling unknown data, or data that can change, I haven’t personally ran into other cases that I can remember. I know they exist, I’m curious.

Also, there seems to be an increased amount of chat around the potential feature too, so it seems like a good topic to have some technical discussion about.

Looking for a standalone KV database that supports RestAPI to interact with.

Preferably written in Go. Do you know any?
