Its is just me? I cant seem to get on track on using hooks rather than class based components.

When Im using classes I can understand it more and Its much easier for me atleast.
Everyones saying hooks are the future and its much more modern I don‚Äôt want to get left out thats why I‚Äôm learning it, but I‚Äôm having such a hard time.

 Hi, I have a table with MateriaTable in react, and a route system in a route is the table, everything works fine until I navigate between the routes several times and the route from where I have the table freezes and gives me an error.

&amp;#x200B;

   
any solution? And what other alternatives similar to MaterialTable do you recommend?

## [11][Jest &amp; React testing library. Test API hit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jst66e/jest_react_testing_library_test_api_hit/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jst66e/jest_react_testing_library_test_api_hit/
---
Hello there, I'm new to react and react testing and I want to do the following test (maybe its a silly question):

"When a button on the page is clicked, check whether the API is hit or not"

I can do the button hit after render() using [fireEvent.click](https://fireEvent.click)(), but I don't know how can I ensure whether the API is hit after the button is clicked. (I only need to check whether the API is hit or not)

Is there any traces or records kept of the api hit from where I can pick the latest hit api and compare with what is expected to hit? Or what else should I do?

I searched on google but no help. Please guide me on how can I write test for the above mentioned case.

Thanks

     const [pizza, setPizza] = useState({ base: "", toppings: [] });
    
      const addBase = (base) =&gt; {
        setPizza({ ...pizza, base })
      }
      
      const addTopping = (topping) =&gt; {
        let newToppings;
        if(!pizza.toppings.includes(topping)){
          newToppings = [...pizza.toppings, topping];
        } else {
          newToppings = pizza.toppings.filter(item =&gt; item !== topping);
        }
        setPizza({ ...pizza, toppings: newToppings });
      }

Can anyone explain this code to me. Thanks.
