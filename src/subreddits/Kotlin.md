I'm looking for an open source micro-service, written in Kotlin, that has excellent testing practices to get inspiration from: unit, integration, and e2e tests with CI/CD. On AWS would be the cherry on top.

If you know of one, please share!

As far as I know, Kotlin doesn't support Combination library.  


So what is the way to make the fastest element Combination in List?

I think recursive solution is not fast,,

Is it good to stick to primitives in kotlin ? 
Or will it cost me too much to wrap some of my code in a class and play with types ? 
I watched this video but again the discussion on this says that itâ€™s always not the best thing to do.

Confused. 
Any clear suggestion

I am converting some Kotlin code to work in KMP and apparently there are some limitations with reflection there, plus I always wondered if there was a more straightforward way to do this since reflection is not always the preferred solution.  Using the following simplified code is there a way to check the eval() instance of 2 classes will return the same type?  

&amp;#x200B;

abstract class Function {

abstract fun eval(): Number

}

&amp;#x200B;

class Function1 : Function() {

override fun eval(): Int = 55

}

&amp;#x200B;

class Function2 : Function() {

override fun eval(): Double = 5.5

}

&amp;#x200B;

fun foo(a: Function, b: Function) {

// TODO without calling eval(), check if a.eval() returns the same type as b.eval()

}

So i need to validate username/password and then redirect to another screen. Validation needs to be done in the background process while, and redirection on main thread. How should i do that? Using coroutines?
