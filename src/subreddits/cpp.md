**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

    .cpp // C++ source file
    .hpp // C++ header file
    .mpp // C++ module file

Though extension .cppm may already have been standarized ... just wanted to share this :)

I think it's classy ( pun intended )!

Currently, I have a C++ Primer 4th edition. Should I learn C++ from this book which deals with an older version of C++? Start with a Yes or No and kindly state the reasons.

Hi all,

I recently switched to working in a Windows environment for dev work and am experiencing Visual Studio for the first time. Really impressed with the debugger, not so impressed with the layout (mostly cause I'm not used to it), anyway, I was curious what people here consider their essential Visual Studio extensions for C++ work? 

So far I found a couple that I really like:

Viasfora - color coded braces

FastFind - does what it says on the tin... paid, but I love it!

Hi all, 

I'm a third year CS student. In all my classes, I have only every made programs that have worked via the command line. I'm starting on a personal project that involves creating a program for sports tournaments such as seeding players, displaying stats, etc.

My major questions are:

1). Can I code my program as a simple command line based program, then integrate the GUI after? Or should I implement my program with the GUI the first time around. 

2). I've looked into how GUIs can be implemented and want to try wxWidgets. Is this a good idea?

3). Should I use a different language? I've read that GUIs are hard to implement via C++. I have only learned C++, C, and Python, but am not against learning new languages! 

4). Are there any good guides that you can recommend to me?

Any and all help are appreciated! Thank you! :D
