Hey guys I was just wondering what the difference between the two is. When I do array.dup all of the elements of the array have their original object IDs. However, if I do array.clone.map(&amp;:clone) then I get different objects IDs. Can someone explain how this works in memory? Thank you.

Edit : What does this mean?  "*the* instance variables of *obj* are copied, but not the objects they reference "

With [this commit](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/b60153241121297c94de976419d421683da4d51b) Pattern Matching is no longer marked as an experimental Ruby feature ðŸ™‚

Hi everyone

I'm looking to improve [a refactoring gem](https://github.com/AlexB52/retest) that handles most Ruby setups. 

I'm currently integrating Hanami setups and was wondering if anyone had a running Hanami project on production I could talk to. 

I would like to write close to reality specs instead of the bookshelf 101 example. Currently the  gem is not designed to handle gracefully controller, views, templates action files like:

    apps/web/controllers/home/index.rb
    spec/web/controllers/books/index_spec.rb

I can imagine that this setup ends with a lot of `index, new, create, update ...` files from `templates, controllers, views` with different namespaces. 

**I'm trying to come up with a realistic list of files from a small to medium project to help me improve the way the gem matches spec files.** I'm not really interested in the code inside the project files but mostly a complex setup of pathnames for an Hanami project. I would really appreciate if someone could help me with this as I haven't worked with Hanami before. 

*On a side note: Hanami has some really compelling features, wonder how it is to work with it*

Let me know   
Thanks
