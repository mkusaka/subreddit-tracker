I've finished my enhancements (revisions, really) of the Rdoc for Hash.  They will be seen in the next release, but may be seen now at [https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Hash.html](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Hash.html).  My main goal was to have example code for just about everything.

The current Rdoc is at [https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Hash.html](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Hash.html).

I've begun work on Array.

 I'm using Lugo Labs Circle [https://www.lugolabs.com/circles](https://www.lugolabs.com/circles) . I've created a test.html file in the root of my application that references circles.min.js and the javascript code works fine. I put the same code in my show.html.erb file referencing the same circles.min.js file and it doesn't work. Any ideas why?
