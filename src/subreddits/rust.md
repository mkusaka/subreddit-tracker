Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fc7h20/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

A someone coming from C++-land and working with Rust recently, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how Rust's slices work. With C++, whenever I see a `std::string_view` or `std::span`, I know that there's a struct/class containing a pointer to the beginning of some contiguous sequence and a size. I understand that Rust's `&amp;str` and `&amp;[T]` primitives serve the same purpose.

What (I think) I know: `&amp;str` and `&amp;[T]` (and `&amp;OsStr`, etc.) behave less like "pointers" or "references", despite the `&amp;`, and more like structures holding a reference to the data and the size. The fact that `mem::size_of::&lt;&amp;str&gt;()` is 16 bytes on my system and that the following code:

    let foo = "Hello, world!";

compiles down to:

    example::test:
            push    rax
            lea     rax, [rip + .L__unnamed_1]
            mov     rdi, rax
            mov     esi, 13
            ...

when optimizations are disabled seems to confirm this.

What I don't understand is what exactly `str` and `[T]` are. The documentation seems to just gloss over them. What do they represent and how are they laid out in memory? Why aren't `str` and `[T]` themselves the structure that holds the pointer and size?

I'm unable to call `std::mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;()` on `str` or `[T]` or create variables of those types without hitting compile errors. I know that it's possible to use these types though. Looking at the [`OsStr` implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/15812785344d913d779d9738fe3cca8de56f71d5/src/libstd/ffi/os_str.rs#L106-L108), it seems to boil down to [a struct holding a `[u8]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/15812785344d913d779d9738fe3cca8de56f71d5/src/libstd/sys_common/os_str_bytes.rs#L27-L29). What does it mean for a struct to contain a `[u8]`?

When I see `&amp;str`, my brain is trying to equate that to `std::string_view *` in C++. I know that's not correct and that it actually behaves like a `std::string_view`. Maybe it'd be more intuitive to me if I knew why the `&amp;` is there and what purpose it serves.

I'd appreciate any pointers (ha!) for better understanding these types!
## [10][release of crow 0.4.0, a pixel perfect 2D graphics library](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fgeoey/release_of_crow_040_a_pixel_perfect_2d_graphics/)

After publishing version [0.3.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f2wuwc/i_just_published_crow_03_a_pixel_perfect_2d/), this version of `crow` now supports OpenGL version ~~0.3.3~~ `3.3` and has actually decent errors.

Using it in my WIP showcase game, [akari](https://github.com/lcnr/akari), I am really happy with the current API and will keep working on it in the future.

[https://github.com/scooter-dangle/midas\_rs](https://github.com/scooter-dangle/midas_rs)

Original implementation: [https://github.com/bhatiasiddharth/MIDAS](https://github.com/bhatiasiddharth/MIDAS)

Corresponding paper: [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/\~sbhatia/assets/pdf/midas.pdf](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sbhatia/assets/pdf/midas.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

A teammate wanted to noodle around with the algorithm described in the paper. The original C++ implementation is already pretty straight-forward (which made the port very easy), but both to be able to understand the workings of the algorithm a little better and to have a version that we'd be more comfortable supporting (since we work primarily in Rust and Python) if anyone on the team wanted to play with it, I ported it to Rust.

I haven't done any benchmarking or extensive testsâ€”will develop further based on interest from the team or external users.

I think the original author will be around here in case anyone has questions about the algorithm itself and how to interpret the outputs.
