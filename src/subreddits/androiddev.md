This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Just received an email from them:

&gt; Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities, we have decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event at Shoreline Amphitheatre.
&gt; 
&gt; All guests who have purchased tickets to I/O 2020 will receive a full refund by March 13, 2020. If you don’t see the credit on your statement by then, please reach out to io@google.com. Guests who have registered for I/O 2020 will not need to enter next year’s drawing and will be automatically granted the option of purchasing an I/O 2021 ticket.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the coming weeks, we will explore other ways to evolve Google I/O to best connect with our developer community. We will keep the Google I/O website updated with additional information.
&gt; 
&gt; As always, we appreciate your enthusiasm and patience. For additional questions, please contact io@google.com
&gt; 
&gt; The Google I/O Team

Doesn't seem like they have updated their website yet, however.

## [6][PSA: Android Studio 3.6 tends to forget your active build flavor, in which case pressing 'Run' button executes 'assemble' task, and runs compilation for ALL flavors in ALL build types (both debug and release)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fcuyn7/psa_android_studio_36_tends_to_forget_your_active/)

I thought I was messing something up originally, but it seems that if you switch between flavors, Android Studio 3.6 issues `gradlew assemble` and then no wonder the build takes more than 10 minutes.

It's better to use terminal command `gradlew :app:assembleFlavorIActuallyWantDebug` to avoid this issue.

I've been writing android apps professionally for 7 years. Wrote several personal apps prior to that and have been steeped in android since the froyo days.

But I'm in a contract now and feel like such a n00b.

These guys love alpha code. If Google comes out with something new, it's in their apps within days. That's not bad. It's just tiring. Having absorbed and learned various patterns, classes or architecture that Google promotes and then deprecates (ie AsyncTasks, Broadcast Receivers, Content resolver, oh, I could go on and on) while introducing new patterns classes and architecture (WorkManager, Paging Library, androidx, view binding, and on and on) I feel like like all my previous knowledge is worthless. I'm learning all the new stuff, which is cool, but really difficult to be billed as "senior android developer" and get shit done without getting bogged down in trying to understand new things.  

Anyone else ever feel like that?   I feel like like a junior developer who studied the most recent googly shit for a couple of weeks would stomp me in a sprint comparing story points completed. 

How can I get that "I really do know wtf I'm doing" feeling back?
