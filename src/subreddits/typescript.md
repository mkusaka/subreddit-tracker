## [2][Need ideas for a 30 minutes workshop on Typescript](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j349k2/need_ideas_for_a_30_minutes_workshop_on_typescript/)

So, I started convincing my team (all JS devs) to make the switch to Typescript, and the CTO of my company told me to make a 30 minutes workshop to teach them about typescript and SHOW how it could benefit our company. 

We have a front end in React and React-Native and a back-end in Node, so to me the advantage is obvious, but I feel that some people still needs a bit of convincing.

So this workshop needs both to be an introduction to TS as well as a showcase of how powerful it can be, any ideas of how I could/should do it? 

P.S.: I don't have any experience making workshops either, so any tips could help, really.

I've been looking at the [various runtime type &amp; validation libs](https://github.com/moltar/typescript-runtime-type-benchmarks) and I'm generally impressed by what they do, but the dependence on function objects to represent types was driving me crazy, so I set out to create the same effect without them.

It was surprisingly challenging to coax the type inference engine to do what I wanted, and IMHO the results are amazing and I'm super stoked about it.

Unfortunately I simply could not avoid using functions to build structures, but for singular types the proxies are just the name of the type!

If there's any interest I will try to roll it into a library.

---
so hard to explain here (or to google) exactly what I'm looking for. I want to 

1. have a single source of possible events (either as a union of strings, or keys in an interface)
2. then use that list to build new types where I get hints from that list of possible events

Let's imagine some fake DOM events:


    interface DomEvents {
        'click': DomClickEvent;
        'keydown': DomKeyDownEvent;
    }

then I want to use these events (click, keydown) in another type while getting autocompletions and I don't know how to do that.

I want to do something like this (type a type), but it's obviously impossible:

    type DomEventMap: {[K in keyof DomEvents]: () =&gt; void} = {
         // get autocomplete here for the props (click, keydown)
    }

I'm sure I'm spacing out on something I've seen before, but I can't find a good example of this anywhere

I have a base type (ex: Record&lt;string, any&gt;) that I want to ensure is true for all sub-type instances. For each sub-type, I have a set of specific keys which will be valid which return a specific set of values.

For example: type MyType extends Record&lt;string, any&gt; = { a: string, b: number }

I am looking for a way to get the type "a" | "b" from MyType. However, using "keyof MyType" == "string | number".

What is the right way to extract only ("a" | "b") into a type of its own, given MyType as the input?

I created a FULLY TYPED Twitter API Client for Node.js ðŸ”§  
This client is taking full advantage of modern TypeScript capabilites!

âœ… **Fully typed!** Both for query parameters and responses.  
âœ… Includes 90% of the **official Twitter API** endpoints.  
âœ… **Promise-based!** No ugly callbacks.  
âœ… Inbuilt in-memory **cache** for rate-limit friendly usage.

Check it out ðŸ‘‡

It's by far my most common use of !. In strict mode all Env variables have an implicit type of `string | undefined`.

Just curious if you guys also use ! with them. Or if you do something else such as asserting `process.env` as `any`
## [10][Trying to wrap my head around type inference failing](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j1bcj4/trying_to_wrap_my_head_around_type_inference/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/j1bcj4/trying_to_wrap_my_head_around_type_inference/

Hi, I've run into Typescript failing to infer something and I'm trying to understand why. This simple example works:

```
type Group&lt;A, B&gt; = {
    createA: () =&gt; A,
    aToB: (a: A) =&gt; B,
};

function doSomething&lt;A, B&gt;(group: Group&lt;A, B&gt;) {
    const a = group.createA();
    const b = group.aToB(a);

    return b;
}

const example = doSomething({
    createA: () =&gt; 123,
    aToB: (value) =&gt; value.toString(),
});
```

So `example` is inferred as `Group&lt;number, string&gt;`, aToB's value parameter is number, `aToB` returns a string. All makes sense.

But if I add another function to `Group` that takes `B` as a parameter:

```
type Group&lt;A, B&gt; = {
    createA: () =&gt; A,
    aToB: (a: A) =&gt; B,
    logB: (b: B) =&gt; void
};

function doSomething&lt;A, B&gt;(group: Group&lt;A, B&gt;) {
    const a = group.createA();
    const b = group.aToB(a);

    group.logB(b);

    return b;
}

const example = doSomething({
    createA: () =&gt; 123,
    aToB: (value) =&gt; value.toString(),
    logB: (value) =&gt; console.log(value)
});
```

`A` remains a number, but `B` becomes `unknown`.

I'm trying to figure out why this is. I assume now that `B` is used as a parameter, that stops Typescript from being able to infer `B` as being the result of `createA`, and since there's no type on `logB: (value)`, it gives up and calls it unknown.

I can get around this by `logB: (value: string) =&gt; console.log(value)`, but is there a way to tell Typescript to always infer `B` from the return type of `createA`, even if it's used as a parameter elsewhere?

Hi, good evening!

My name is William and I am a senior engineer based in the UK.

I am looking for a couple of junior developers who would like to work with me on an open source project that aims to help photographers and other media artist with a workflow manager.

If anyone is looking for a project to work on to learn more about Vue and TypeScript, I would be very happy to mentor them.

Cheers!
