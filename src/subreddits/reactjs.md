We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

ðŸ‘‹ Hey guys! We're all visual learners, so here's the second part of a series focused on learning React through visual mental models. 

The article covers: useState, useEffect, and Lifecycles.

You'll find many original illustrations inside. I believe that makes understanding complex topics a lot easier.  


Enjoy! I'm happy to answer any question.

## [5][[Interview question] . how can you dispatch from useEffect without using useDispatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/grjjv4/interview_question_how_can_you_dispatch_from/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/grjjv4/interview_question_how_can_you_dispatch_from/

Long story short, I was asked to write how can I dispatch from useEffect (this is my componentDidMount) without using useDispatch.

First I wrote the component approach 
`
Import {getUserDetails} from './actions

class Example extends React.component {

componentDidMount(){
  this.props.getUserDetails()
}
}
const mapDispatchToProps  = dispatch =&gt;{
    const details={
          getUserDetails: ()=&gt;{
              dispatch(getUserDetails());
          }
    }
return details;
}

export default Connect(mapDispatchToProps)(Example)
`


For hooks, I wrote

`
useEffect(() =&gt;{
   props.getUserDetails();
}, [ ])
`

And I said that this change is enough to dispatch. (Ofcourse I will change the declaration to function based, but mapDispatchToProps and imports will be the same)

Interviewer said, " What you wrote in class based component will hit the API inside the getUserDetails but my functional component won't hit the API. 

Is my useEffect code is wrong? Isn't this how we can dispatch from useEffect without using useDispatch?

Hello,

I am looking into adding a parameter like ?v=20200527 to the bundle script files linked in index.html.

I believe this could solve some browser caching issues that have been encountered by some heavy users of my app. Would you have any hint about how to do this. possibly without ejecting from create-react-app? I have spent some time googling but couldn't find anything... any idea?

Thanks for your time :)

Video (link below) where the author went through the process of setting up a basic image classifier. Itâ€™s super basic, but he hopes it serves as a gateway drug of sorts into machine learning for the web. Machine learning is awesome and wildly under-utilised, considering its potential.

 Hello devs

Wouldnâ€™t it be great to have a place where we can share our valuable insights, DD and news with whom we want when we want.

Iâ€™m building an app to which other developers can hook there apps (one guy build an option trading algorithm where he would make X amount of profit in 13 weeks, I havenâ€™t heard from him in a while so Iâ€™m guessing it didnâ€™t go according to plan). The app also has a polling bot (on earnings for example) news, messaging, an earnings calendar which will be customizable to the companies you follow and portfolio analytics.

Itâ€™s still a work in progress but if you would like to subscribe for when itâ€™s finished please let me know. Or If you want to help/contribute to build this beautiful beast then also let me know

Hi guys,

I am releasing a new form library designed to create quick and easy forms with full validation.

[React Bare Forms](https://github.com/joegasewicz/react-bare-forms)

I did try a few other form libraries for React &amp; found their public API's a bit convoluted (this is purely my personal opinion, not a declaration!). This  library's main goal then, is to have a much more simple approach to creating forms with React &amp; contain the least amount of learning required by the user to start creating validated forms.

I would be extremely grateful if anyone could give the library a quick once over, look at features or open any issues for features that are currently missing!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks very much for your time

Joe
