Hi, I have learned the basics of react and redux and now I want to make a workout planner with a range of exercise lists.

However, I didn't find a good workout API that has a lot of exercises.
So I was wondering how I could make my own API which would consists of the picture of the exercise,which muscle it works and a short description on how to execute it.

Is a MERN stack suitable? Where can I store the pictures and information?

I have nearly no experience on Full Stack development, only a few tutorials so I'm sorry if this is a stupid question

 Appreciate any help.

I don't know much about XML but the similarity in appearance between JSX and HTML just leads me to wonder why HTML was not included in the name in JSX, and why XML?
## [7][How to use update Zustand state outside React component?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jgn79s/how_to_use_update_zustand_state_outside_react/)

**EDIT: sorry for the typo in the title, Reddit doesn't allow me to change it after posting.**

Hi,

I'm interested in Zustand because I could update my global state directly in my api service, outside of any React component. Zustand works well in a React component, but how to update it outside of them?

Here is my store:

    import create from "zustand";
    
    export const userStore = create((set) =&gt; ({
      name: "Joe",
      age: 35,
      hobbies: ["fishing", "eating salmon"],
      details: {
        isCool: true,
        car: "porsche"
      },
      updateUser: (data) =&gt; set((user) =&gt; ({ ...user, ...data }))
    }));

Here is a component that call a dummy external function fetchUser():

    import React from "react";
    import { userStore } from "./stores/user";
    import { fetchUser } from "./utils/fetchUser";
    
    export default function Test() {
      const { name } = userStore();
      return (
        &lt;&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;hello {name}&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; fetchUser()}&gt;fetch User&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
      );
    }

And the fetchUser() function:

    import { userStore } from "../stores/user";
    
    export function fetchUser() {
      const user = userStore();
      const result = { name: "John", details: { car: "ferrari", isCool: false } };
      return user.setState(result);
    }

I receive the following error: "Invalid hook call". How to fix this?

Here is a sandbox to test the mini-app: [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-zustand-forked-uqgum?file=/src/utils/fetchUser.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-zustand-forked-uqgum?file=/src/utils/fetchUser.js)

I worked really hard to make it, but there are no users ðŸ˜­, so I'm promoting it to Reddit.

I tried ui design to give the Apple Big sur feel.

Building an app, i created a homepage (component) that displays some of the user information in cards

when i click on the button it should navigate to another page (component) showing more information about that user, but struggling to implement that

Here's the code that displays all users:

 export default classÂ FetchUserÂ extendsÂ React.ComponentÂ {  
 constructor()Â {  
 super();  
 this.stateÂ =Â {Â data:Â \[\]Â };  
Â Â }  
Â Â clickMe(el){  
alert('test')  
console.log(el);  
Â Â };  
 asyncÂ componentDidMount()Â {  
 constÂ responseÂ =Â awaitÂ fetch(\`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\`);  
 constÂ jsonÂ =Â awaitÂ response.json();  
 this.setState({Â data:Â jsonÂ });  
Â Â }  
Â Â render()Â {  
 returnÂ (  
 &lt;div className="row"&gt;  
 &lt;Router&gt;  
 {this.state.data.map((el)Â =&gt;Â (  
 &lt;div className="cardDiv" key={el.id}&gt;  
 &lt;Card style={{Â width:Â "18rem"Â }}&gt;  
 &lt;Card.Img variant="top" /&gt;  
 &lt;Card.Body&gt;  
 &lt;Card.Title&gt;  
 &lt;h1 className="contactName"&gt;{el.name\[0\]}&lt;/h1&gt;  
 &lt;/Card.Title&gt;  
 &lt;Card.Text&gt;  
 &lt;strong&gt;{el.name}&lt;/strong&gt;  
 &lt;/Card.Text&gt;  
 &lt;Card.Text&gt;@{el.username}&lt;/Card.Text&gt;  
 &lt;Card.Text&gt;  
 &lt;a href="#"&gt;  
 &lt;u&gt;{el.email}&lt;/u&gt;  
 &lt;/a&gt;  
 &lt;/Card.Text&gt;  
 &lt;button className="btnCard" onClick={this.clickMe.bind(this,el)}&gt;MOREÂ DETAILS&lt;/button&gt;  
 &lt;/Card.Body&gt;  
 &lt;/Card&gt;  
   
 &lt;/div&gt;  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ))}  
 &lt;/Router&gt;  
 &lt;/div&gt;  
Â Â Â Â );  
Â Â }  
}  
Essentially, the button click should link to a path /about with the specific id of a user. what I've done so far is to log the object to the console.
## [12][Question: How does reactjs re-render components?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jglv6c/question_how_does_reactjs_rerender_components/)

Hi,
I'm new to reactjs. I'm going through their docs to understand how react works. So it was mentioned that when state/props/setState() changes/called, react rerenders the entire component. Also I read that react elements are immutable and they are rendered only when there is a change. So when react tries to render a component it actually traverses through all the elements checks for differences and renders only those elements whose data is changed. It won't simply re-render the entire component. Am I right regarding this? Or is my understanding wrong?
