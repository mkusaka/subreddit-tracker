Current situation is I'm developing a shopify app on Node/Koa.js. It returns a context object with some important details such as the store name and other things. 

I could tell Typescript `ctx.session` is `any` to turn off type checking. But then what is the point of TS, and also it's good for me as a developer to actually learn the shape of what I'm resolving for clarity.

Documentation on ctx.session is lacking:

[https://github.com/koajs/session](https://github.com/koajs/session)

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/koa-shopify-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/koa-shopify-auth)

Faced with this situation how do you guys proceed? I am thinking I should just run a test to see what comes back, log it and write an interface based on that.

If this is a situation you guys would just mark as `any` I am open to that advice too.
## [3][casting a variable from a type to a subtype](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/emnzj9/casting_a_variable_from_a_type_to_a_subtype/)

Given some type and an extension of that type:

```
interface Item {
  type: string
}

interface ItemTypeA extends Item {
  valA: number
}
```

Sometimes I need to take a variable of the type and cast it to the more specific type via the `as` keyword:
```
function fn1(item: Item) {
  if (item.type === 'A') {
    const itemA = item as ItemTypeA;
    const { valA } = itemA
    // ...
  }
}
```

Alternatively, it can be done via a type checking function:

```
const itemIsA = (item: Item): item is ItemTypeA =&gt; item.type === 'A';

function fn2(item: Item) {
  if (itemIsA(item)) {
    const { valA } = item;
    // ...
  }
}
```

The first way seems more convenient, explicit, and doesn't require an extra function. With the second way, even though the compiler knows that the item has been casted to a new type, a human reader must either infer by the checker-function name or see what the checker returns.

When running tests I'm seeing errors for basic browser DOM functions (`ReferenceError: btoa is not defined`), classes, and operations.

```
TS2569: Type 'Uint8Array' is not an array type or a string type. Use compiler option '--downlevelIteration' to allow iterating of iterators.

let base64String = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(buffer)));
```

I've tried setting my `tsconfig.json` to may [variations of the compilerOptions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) but none of them seem to work.

```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "lib": [
            "es2016",
            "dom"
        ]
    }
}
or
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es5",
        "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
    }
}

```

What am I missing? Do I need a reference to `lib.dom.d.ts` somewhere?

I have been recently asked to implement a form with pagination, dynamical elements that would maintain its state.

I have some experience in the Front End field, but I definitely need to learn a lot. 

I would appreciate it if you could take a look at the code and let me know what you think.

## [6][How do I get the intersection of generic types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/elnme2/how_do_i_get_the_intersection_of_generic_types/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/elnme2/how_do_i_get_the_intersection_of_generic_types/

Suppose I have:

    type union = string | number;
    type subset = union &amp; string; // subset = string;

I'd like to do something like:

    interface A&lt;T&gt; { }
    type union = A&lt;string&gt; | A&lt;number&gt;;
    type subset = union &amp; A&lt;string&gt;; // expect subset = A&lt;string&gt;

The subset type in this case becomes `(A&lt;string&gt; &amp; A&lt;string&gt;) | (A&lt;string&gt; &amp; A&lt;number&gt;)`, which I don't think is what I want.

Update: I solved the problem using Extract&lt;T, U&gt; and by defining a property on my interface with the generic type:

    interface A&lt;T&gt; { _type: T };
    type union = A&lt;string&gt; | A&lt;number&gt;;
    type subset = Extract&lt;union, A&lt;string&gt;&gt;; // A&lt;string&gt; as expected

It is a bit hacky - in my actual code I have a class, so I defined a private setter with that type and it seems to work. The actual use case is a much more complex type whose details don't belong here, but the above sums it up well.

Hej Typescript people. :)

I need to override an existing type of a property. How can i achieve this?

I've made an codesandbox example: [https://codesandbox.io/s/typescript-playground-export-u2203](https://codesandbox.io/s/typescript-playground-export-u2203)

At the end, the test prop should accept strings and numbers.
## [11][how to import TypeScript library main function and typings from same location](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ekm021/how_to_import_typescript_library_main_function/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ekm021/how_to_import_typescript_library_main_function/

I am writing a TypeScript library + an example-app, each in separate codebases. I am having trouble getting the library's main function and its typings to be accessible from its import root; I want to be able to consume the library like this:

    import myMainFunc, { InterfaceA, InterfaceB } from 'my-lib';

However, I can only import the types from my-lib, not the main func. I have an entrypoint `index.ts` containing a default export, and a `types.ts` containing all relevant types:

    src/
      index.ts
      types.ts

My package.json has

      "files": [
        "/dist/"
      ],
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "typings": "dist/types.d.ts",

and my tsconfig has

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "lib": ["es6", "dom", "es2017"],
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "declaration": true,
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "strict": true
      },
      "include": ["src"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules", "src/test/*"]
    }

The built dist directory looks like:

    dist/
      index.js
      index.d.ts
      types.js
      types.d.ts

Note: the library is not yet published, so I use `yarn link` to pull it in as a dependency to the example app.
