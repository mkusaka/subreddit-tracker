Hello, I know this isn't the sub's forte, but I can't find a solution to a problem I'm having.

So on AppleScript, I am trying to use javascript to click a ui element. For example, it will click "post" or something like that. I can't figure out how to simulate a mouse click though. I've tried using

appName.click({

at: [564, 466]

})

to click on the app's UI element, but it doesn't work. I have already given it

var appName = sys_events.processes['appInFinder']; //gets app process

but this still doesn't work. I have also tried https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/355256's solution, but that just crashes AppleScript. If anyone can help me, I'd be in your debt. Thanks.

I also already have a sys_events var from Application('System Events'). I should also mention that it's supposed to be for roblox. I tried to click in Safari, and it works there, but why does it not work in the roblox app?

Hi everyone, I'm a final-year student studying Web-Design and Development.

I'm working on my thesis where I am comparing the viability of projects built with Web Components compared to those built purely with JavaScript Frameworks like Vue.js, React, etc...I was wondering if some people have work experiences with Web Components they could share. Especially curious to hear from people working in companies that considered switching or switched to Web Components for their projects.

If this is not appropriate for this subreddit, my apologies.
