Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ijvwsk/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hi all,

Title says it all. I'm currently planning to talk about triats, ownership and error handling. If you have any better ideas/ points or critisim i would really like to hear.

## [11][Request for feedback on a data structure I wrote: a hash map / LRU cache for compressible values](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/irpdjt/request_for_feedback_on_a_data_structure_i_wrote/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/irpdjt/request_for_feedback_on_a_data_structure_i_wrote/

Here's the code: https://github.com/bonsairobo/compressible-map

Things I'd like feedback on:

- the public APIs / ergonomics
- performance characteristics
- the use of unsafe in the LocalCache implementation
- general style

During implementation, I've struggled most with two operations that seem at odds with each other:

1. borrowing multiple values at a time
2. decompressing values and placing them in the cache

Of course, it would be trivial to allow borrows of the values in the cache if I didn't update the cache to reflect those accesses. But that kind of defeats the whole LRU scheme. And I didn't want to add too much overhead with extra heap indirection (boxing all values) and smart pointers.

So what I came up with was a compromise where the main cache stays immutable, but readers can use a LocalCache object to store any values that weren't present in the cache and required decompression. Then after all of the borrows get dropped and we get mutable access to the global cache, the LocalCache can be flushed back into the global cache.

The only issue here is that even the LocalCache can't be mutable, since then you can't borrow multiple values from it. To get around this, I used interior mutability via UnsafeCell. I did my best to make sure all of the unsafe code is sound, but this is my first time doing something like this, so please let me know if you spot anything unsound!

Of course, I expect a lot of suggestions to avoid unsafe entirely and just use things like RefCell. I'm open to suggestions like this, but it would be ideal if I didn't have to compromise performance, since this data structure will be used in hot paths of my application. But I haven't actually done any benchmarking yet, I've just been trying to reason about theoretical overhead involved. I'll try to stay open-minded, but will ultimately resort to benchmarking to make final decisions on implementation.

**Edit:** Thank you so much everyone! A lot of your comments really encouraged me to keep at it! And some of you who gave tips to the points that I was confused about really cleared a lot of clouds as well. 🦀 You guys are awesome! 🦀

I started learning Rust a bit over a week ago using the book *The Rust Programming Language* as well as Exercism with a background in Python and some familiarity with Go. In the book I'm around Chapter 9 on error handling but have briefly seen other topics like *generics* and *lifetime*.

As of now I still feel like I cannot think well in Rust. The `String` and `&amp;str` types still throw me off sometimes during compiling. Reading the official documentation is sometimes confusing when I found that I could use `to_lowercase` on a `String` type and have very little clue what `Methods from Defef&lt;Target=str&gt;` means. Not to mention not remembering when `collect` can be used or what the difference between `iter` and `into_iter` are. The list goes on.

Given my non-technical background, the learning curve is naturally steep and I imagine I'd read the official book, consult many other resources, and fight the compiler messages many many times before I imprint the concepts and patterns onto my brain.

Nevertheless, I'm curious to know how other Rustaceans here first started learning Rust? How many times have you read the book? And how did you get out of this befuddled feeling even when reading official documentation? 🙏🏻
