Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Hi everyone

Due to corona i occasionally have some unemployment days which means i have some time left over. I want to do something with this time and i was looking for some side-hustle in the cpp area for example as a code reviewer/bug fixer on Fiverr.

&amp;#x200B;

My profile:

Graduated sept '19, masters degree in electronics/ICT engineering

Working fulltime as a c++ developer since sept '19

&amp;#x200B;

Would i be experienced enought to do something like this?

Does anyone have experience with Fiverr (or other platforms)?

If so, is it somewhat profitable? Getting rich fast isn't the goal, but i would like to spend my time useful by helping someone/gaining experience/making some extra money as a bonus.
## [5][[C++ Web Game + Update] SFML Game Engine for Web (HTML), Android &amp; PC](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jqhqmx/c_web_game_update_sfml_game_engine_for_web_html/)

Hi everyone, hope you are doing well!

&amp;#x200B;

A new update of **is::Engine** (SFML Game Engine) is available but this time it comes with a **web game** that was created with the engine.

This is a special version of the game (Complete game overhaul) **I Can Transform** (released on Android) created to celebrate these 2 years.

The game was created with **SFML** except the physics engine that I had coded myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the new features of version 3.1.1:

► **IS\_ENGINE\_RENDER**: allows you to optimize your games so that they can run on old computers (mine for example \^\^).

► **Game Slider**: allows you to do sliding actions (like on Smartphones) to manipulate your menus.

► **Transition Effect**: allows you to make Fade Out and Fade In type transition effects.

► **Improved web support**: many bugs have been fixed.

► **Support of Render Texture in web development.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Game Engine link**: [Here](https://github.com/Is-Daouda/is-Engine)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is web game link**: [Here](http://is-daouda.github.io)

(It's a web game so it's playable on PC and mobile)

A tip to start the game well, note that the environment is your best ally in this game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is the Game trailer**: [Here](https://youtu.be/vETLpYMc2sA)

&amp;#x200B;

The development of the game and the engine update were done during this week (at my free time of course) so I didn’t have time to create many levels. But believe me, there’s enough for you to have a good time. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Your questions are welcome

&amp;#x200B;

Have a good day :)

I am in my first year of University, and I was wondering if there were any good IDEs for c++ in MacOS, since they use visual studio for windows in my classes and I only have a MacBook.

Thank you in advance

## [8][Conservative instantiation in variadic templates](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jqx1oa/conservative_instantiation_in_variadic_templates/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jqx1oa/conservative_instantiation_in_variadic_templates/
---
A use case of variadic templates that often arises in my libraries and applications is the following:

    void f(std::convertible_to&lt;double&gt; auto const&amp;... x);

Or put into words: wanting to accept an arbitrary number of arguments that all have to be convertible to a certain type. The issue with the provided implementation is that it leads to an arbitrary number of template instantiations even in the case that they all have the same number of parameters:

    f(1.0, 2.0), f(1.0, 2); // etc.

More instantiations lead to bloated binaries and longer compile and link times, so it is self-explanatory that one wants to avoid instantiations wherever possible. I would propose using a syntax along the lines of this:

    void f(double... x);

This, too, should just be an abbreviated function template but the deduced type parameter pack `T` ought to satisfy the constraint `std::conjunction_v&lt;std::is_same&lt;T, double&gt;...&gt;`. In other words, only the number of types in the pack should vary between instantiations, not the types themselves.

This proposed syntax may clash however with plain old C variadics (in the case that the argument pack isn't named) because they - for some reason - aren't required to be separated by a comma. A possible solution is requiring such typed parameter packs to always be named.

Has anybody seen or written a proposal regarding this? If not, how can I write a proposal?

## [10][Systems Of Units Library in C++](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jqo92n/systems_of_units_library_in_c/)

The following link is to a Systems Of Units (SOU) library which I created in C++. It does all type checks of units and conversions at compile time. Most of the work on the library was out of trying to learn new features and techniques with C++.  The Library includes a test suite written using the Google Test Framework.  See the Readme.md page for more details of use.

[https://github.com/trailfrenzy/SIwithET](https://github.com/trailfrenzy/SIwithET)

Currently the library is tested with the VS C++20 compiler and have not had an opportunity to test it against the GNU C++20 library. Older versions in GitHub are compliant with C++17.

Let me know if you have any problems with the library or errors which you may find.
## [11][Discoverable algorithms](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jqenk4/discoverable_algorithms/)

[http://code-ballads.net/discoverable-algorithms/](http://code-ballads.net/discoverable-algorithms/)

Searching  for algorithms based on the signatures of the transformations they can apply to data is invaluable.

For example, [this link](https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=int-%3E[a]-%3E[a]) demonstrates a search engine used to discover all the available algorithms in Haskell for transformation given a signature "(int, \[a\]) -&gt; \[a\]".

In C++, one library offers such a facility : [FunctionalPlus](https://github.com/Dobiasd/FunctionalPlus).  Access its [API search page](http://www.editgym.com/fplus-api-search/) and enter this in the search box:

    (int, [a]) -&gt; [a]

... and you will find many useful algorithms based on this signature (drop, repeat, stride, drop\_idx, take\_cyclic, partial\_sort, etc, etc.).

I wish more libraries would follow this idea, since reasoning about values and their transformations is a powerful way to render the code more readable and correct at the same time.

For those interested the linked article gives more detail as well as a [video](https://youtu.be/i5Xots8dtDU) that shows how such a search engine can be useful during the development.
