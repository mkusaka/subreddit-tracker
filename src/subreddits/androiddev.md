Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi!

Hi guys, I am looking for the Android 11 emoji ttf so I can port it over to older Android versions, I was hoping anyone on beta 1 could share it, thanks in advance! (If you're rooted you can find it in /system/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf)

Hello, i am using FAN for my apps and implemented banner at bottom of 2 screens out of 7 screens in my app. I checked all documentation where to implement and how to implement. But still my banner keeps failing quality check quite often. 

Any idea how to fix this because i can't find my article or source where i can look it to fix. All installs are organic and no false or fake installs are there on my app.

Thanks

## [12][Will I have cross compatibility issues developing on separate platforms? Mac to Linux and vise versa](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/h7fpbj/will_i_have_cross_compatibility_issues_developing/)

Does anyone have any experience in this? I've recently started developing for Android and was wondering if transferring a project over from my Mac to my Linux machine would cause any problems with gradle or just building the app in general?

If not, what's the best way to approach this? I'll be using Github for version control.

Coming from iOS I've only had the ability to code on my Mac but I'd love to switch over a project I started to my Linux machine.
