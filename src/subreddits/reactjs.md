We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I hear people saying that Redux is used to manage your state and it makes it easier to manager vast quantities of data between components, but when they say it should manage state to what level do they mean.  


Do they mean EVERYTHING that has state is stored in redux? So if I have a modal with a state variable called "isVisible". Should this also be stored in Redux rather than the parent component? Or do they mean you should store things like user details, API response objects, and form data in redux?
## [9][HOC vs Hook vs Render Props for data fetching ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ibyvfh/hoc_vs_hook_vs_render_props_for_data_fetching/)

There's many patterns for data fetching in React. I don't use class components anymore, so i dropped one of them.  


My App.js file is a functional component, but it has a lot of logic (many handler functions, passes many props) and it also fetches data for its children in useEffect.  


Now is it convenient to replace data fetching in useEffect by a Hoc or a render prop ?   
if so, which one to choose ?
