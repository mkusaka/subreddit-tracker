    typeof null === 'object'; // true 

The rationale I've heard is that it's too late to fix this one becaus an update to a null type would break a lot of old programs.

Ok, so why don't we allow this as a default, but then add the null type if a version check indicates ES2020 or later? I think that could be implement with a top of file statement similar to strict mode.

Only answer I can think of is that everyone is used to it, so it isn't a priority.
