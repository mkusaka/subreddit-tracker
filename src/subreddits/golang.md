First, I apologize for the title. I don't even know how to phrase it correctly. 

Here's the [code](https://play.golang.org/p/XpNR8jxwlQk). I don't understand why it works specifically on line 23. Does it mean because responseWriter has http.ResponseWriter in it, it is implementing the io.Writer interface which satisfies fmt.Fprintln?

To me, this [code](https://play.golang.org/p/Kp3qyECTeD-) where responseWriter is an interface type make sense because both (responseWriter and http.ResponseWriter) are the same interface types.

When I put the largest value in (18446744073709551615), and pass it through an unmarshal it becomes a different value. Is this a bug?

I have been working on few web applications in Go but I don't really have the time to find out the "best" places to host my applications. I'd love to know if people here know any.
