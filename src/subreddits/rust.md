Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ghw4v6/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hello,

The company I work at (which does web development) wants to start using Rust, and that's cool because I love the language! However, we first need to convince our clients, and most importantly their CTOs.

We're preparing a presentation with various points to try and make them interested in the language/ecosystem. One of the important points is the feedback of companies that already made the switch.

Here is a list of articles from big tech companies with feedback regarding the swith to Rust (mainly from an a developper's point of view) :

&gt; Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made.

[Rewriting the heart of our sync engine - Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine)

&gt; In general, using Rust has been a really great experience.

[Using Rust in Windows - Microsoft](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/11/07/using-rust-in-windows/)

&gt; Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version. This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go.

I feel like these articles are the three big ones that we got over the last year, do you know of others? I'm also very interested in feedback from the administrative or management point of view, althought it's probably going to be rarer.

I've been thinking of building a new desktop system – first time in years. Being a Rust enthusiast, a relevant question is: how fast it's going to compile Rust code? I have been thinking of building the system around a Ryzen 3900X 12-core processor and 32 gigs of RAM. However, I'm still a bit undecided whether to go all in and one-up it to Ryzen 3950X (16-core). I suspect that's where the diminishing returns are starting to erode the bang-for-the-buck-factor. But if it's still noticeably faster, that's like paying for a good reason.

So, I have a challenge for people with all kinds of systems out there: how fast does your rig build one of the biggest Rust codebases out there: rustc?

Please run the following commands (warning, might take tens of minutes to hours!):
```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git fresh_rust_benchmark # DL the repo
cd fresh_rust_benchmark
./x.py build &amp;&amp; ./x.py clean # DL submodules and pre-build bootstrap &amp; LLVM; clean
time ./x.py build # Measure the main build time
```

And post the time reported by the last command, plus your system specs (including your OS)! If you're on a laptop, be sure to connect the power so you're not limited by power saving features. Also consider setting it not to go the sleep mode.

I'm especially interested hearing about Ryzen systems since that's what I'm considering buying, but any info will be interesting!

Btw. my current workhorse is a mid-2015 MacBook Pro with 4-core 2.8Ghz Core i7 and 16 gigs of 1600Mhz DDR3 RAM. I'll post my numbers once the build finishes, but it might take a good while...

Hi there!

My company gives me the opportunity to have a 15 minute talk on the annual company meeting. Now, I love Rust and there is so much that I would like to say, but I have a hard time finding what is the most important.

For reference, my company uses mainly Java and Angular for business applications.

Cheers!

I know Rust can probably do everything you can imagine if you're low level enough, but I mean for general use cases where programmers aren't intimately familiar with low level APIs or Windows stuff.

I'm assuming C# has a lot better support for various Windows features than Rust does. If that's true, could anyone weigh in on some of them?

Handling UNC paths? Connecting to Exchange servers? Other Windows-y stuff.
## [12][TcpListener unlocked: How to listen on every port and IP simultaneously in one line (using TUN and a Rust implementation of TCP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gqsp9t/tcplistener_unlocked_how_to_listen_on_every_port/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gqsp9t/tcplistener_unlocked_how_to_listen_on_every_port/

As versatile as the TCP socket API is, there are times when some added flexibility could make life a lot easier. Such as when building a non-traditional service that needs to accept connections on any valid TCP port, as done by Cloudflare engineers: [Abusing Linux's firewall: the hack that allowed us to build Spectrum](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-spectrum/).

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of freedom, few options beat bringing your own TCP implementation. By processing IP packets in the application, you can do anything with port numbers. And it has become surprisingly easy in Rust, thanks to the network library [smoltcp](https://crates.io/crates/smoltcp). Being a library that works hard to be small, smoltcp has not added dependency on any async library, or built-in support for TUN, and the process of accepting connections is a bit different from using the usual socket API.  
But its code is very readable and I managed to build on its `TcpSocket` to provide a `TcpListener`, which accepts a TUN device name:

    let mut listener = TcpListener::bind("tun0").unwrap();

This is where it differs from the common `TcpListener` and how it makes it easy to build new types of services. Instead of listening on one address, it accepts any TCP connection that goes through the specified interface, regardless of the port number. IP addresses can be freely added to the interface, any number of IP prefixes can be routed to it, and the listener will start accepting connections on those addresses without further configuration.

The rest is not different from a normal asynchronous TCP socket library. You don't need to write more lines of code to switch to this `TcpListener`. AsyncRead and AsyncWrite are implemented on `TcpStream`.  `local_addr()` can be used to get the actual `SocketAddr` used in a connection.

The repo: [https://github.com/wzhd/ustcp](https://github.com/wzhd/ustcp)

Feel free to share what you think about it!
