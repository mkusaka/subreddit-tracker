Hello everyone! I have made it a professional goal to learn Ruby this year. I have a short background in data management with a little bit of dabbling in python. I have been suggested \_why's poignant guide from two coworkers, both of which mentioned it is outdated but still very good for learning. In addition, it's what they both used when learning Ruby.  

I'm not completely new to programming: I've written a few object-oriented python scripts and whatnot. I'm just curious what you folks used when you first started and what sort of resources/underlying concepts on which I should focus. My main goals are to transpose my Python scripts into Ruby. They include API calls and web scraping. 

Thanks and if I have broken a rule by posting this then please send this post to oblivion (also I apologize).
