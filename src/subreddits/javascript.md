I am looking to build a web app that allows a user to answer a series of questions. The questions are dynamic in that when they answer yes or no to a question it may add additional questions based on their response.  
Example: If they answer that they are over 16, it can add a question asking them if they have their driver's license. If they answer yes to that question, it can then ask about their year and make of their car etc.  
I am looking to possibly have the question determined server-side so that I am only sending question that need to be answered to the client. There is the possibility of having dozens of questions.  
I need to be able to maintain state so that the user can leave/save and resume later. I also need to be able to render the questions on a single page if it is on desktop or have 1 or 2 questions per page if on mobile (or a slow internet connection). I guess I am looking to dynamically generate pages/routes?  
I suppose that I am not leaning towards static site generation and I am probably going to be relying on server side rendering more.  
Any advice would be appreciated. Or any suggestions on a framework that would be good for my needs (React preferred).  
Thanks!
