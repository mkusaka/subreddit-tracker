I made a  chat app built with React &amp; Redux , Node(Express), SocketIo and Twolio amongst other things and offers multiple functionalities such as:

* Video Calling
* Private Messaging
* Group messaging
* Authentication
* Listening to music on spotify

link is [Simply Chat](http://simplychatapp.herokuapp.com/).

Once you create an account you get a sample user added as you friend list. To test with that default user and your account, use email: [test@yahoo.com](mailto:test@yahoo.com) and password is the number 1 typed 8 times.
