Started recently learning java but decided to learn kotlin instead after a bit of time since it looks much less painful, either way, i have a few questions about kotlin that i havent really found the answer to, and i was wondering if there was an active discord server for kotlin with help channels and such, similar to the python one([https://discord.gg/python](https://discord.gg/python)(hope this doesnt count as advertising, if it does i can remove the link)) would be rather useful, ive searched this up a few times and didnt find much, considering theres like 40k subs to this subreddit im surprised someone hasnt made a discord server yet

I recently implemented role-based authorization in our Ktor project, and wrote a blog about its implementation and what we learned about Ktor's internals in the process. Always happy to receive your comments!

Hi you guys, did anyone already read that book called "[Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action)"?  

What did you think one? Did you learned interesting new things about Kotlin? 

Is that book focused on beginner, intermediate or advanced public?
