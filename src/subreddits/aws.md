Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone knew a space or a /r/ where I could see interesting (AWS or not) Architecture/System Designs if possible with a case study, problem definition and maybe a diagram?

I know AWS has a repo of those but they don't write ,the article on the Archi per say, rather on the AWS components used (which make sense). I really liked the video of SuccessInTech when he still posted for example.

Thanks

I have a large legacy bucket with millions of objects all publicly accessible. Objects are owned by another AWS account.

If the AWS account owner / s3 object owner decides to terminate their AWS account, what happens to the publicly accessible objects? 

Will they still be accessible or will end-users receive a 403 forbidden?

Hi - I am looking to understand the difference between setting up a regional vs edge optimized endpoint configuration for my API.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get the API I built for our serverless app on to a better looking URL name for our users. So instead of:

&amp;#x200B;

"n6pj7g42oh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws dot com" I want people to navigate to "example dot com/test" to access the serverless app.

&amp;#x200B;

The app will not experience a ton of traffic and will not be accessed all over the world. Adding this in for context around how this will be used in case that is helpful context.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance.

I recently put together my take on the most important AWS services for newcomers. Of course, this will always be highly dependent on the domain you are operating in, but I think this video serves as a good primer to the most commonly used services today.

Video is available here - https://youtu.be/B08iQQhXG1Y

Let me know if I missed one you thought deserved to be present. I was deliberating Eventbridge and Kinesis.

Hope some find this helpful
