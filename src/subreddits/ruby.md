I am a JS dev my daily work includes writting backend in Node.js, front end in React with some Angular. Started my career 4 years ago and doing only JS/Node.

I decided to move on to something robust and not as messy as whole JS echo-system. Lets say it Js is new PHP.

I am targeting more mature language and framework

Decided on to go with java and spring. But given my js background every recruiter asks about front end skill in react and angular so I can be hired as front end dev only, for Java backends.  My JS  background kind of limiting me in some sense(at least to make the transition smooth)

Recently took a detour and tinkered with Ruby. Loved it. Dynamic, Fully object oriented, mature, expressive. But the thing is the job market and current state of web engineering vibes doesn't seem to favour Ruby or RoR in particular.

Hi all, created Terraspace, a Terraform Framework. It makes it more fun and easy to work with Terraform. Useful for folks building infrastructure-as-code.

Terraspace is written in Ruby. Though it's more like "Ruby Sprinkles" on top of Terraform, you still have the full power of Ruby at your fingertips. Found that Ruby is one of the most expressive languages to build tools and frameworks like Terraspace.

Sharing with the Ruby community.
