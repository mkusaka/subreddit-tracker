This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hi everybody. I got home today from work, excited to work on my side project app. I start cooking our dinner and my girlfriend tells me she can't find the app on the Play store anymore (in closed release). I check my developer account and there's an email from Google. The thing happened that I think many of you dread too: my Google Play Developer/Publisher Account got terminated.

The reason for the ban is deceptive behavior. While not giving any more reasoning behind it, the last thing I updated recently was the app category the day before, so that is probably why.  
Now, to the best of my abilities, I took my time choosing the right categories. I ended up with 4 that I think fit it best. I re-read the list a few times before submitting my choice.  
Now, a day later, I don't even have a developer account.

What makes this worse to me is that:

• I didn't get a warning, saying 'hey, we think this category might not fit your app'. No, Google just straight up terminated my account (which I paid for!)  
• The app was in closed alpha release, so not even public  
• This is my first app ever  
• I've been working for months on this app in my spare time  
• I was going to use this application in my portfolio/resume

As a bit of background info: it's a silly game app, where the goal is commanding a little rocket to a kind of space portal without colliding with surrounding objects. Very simple in theory. Innocent.  
The app is built in Flutter, a (Google!) technology I've invested a good chunk of my time in in the past year. I participated in a Flutter contest by Google in May last year and won one of the minor prizes with it. I didn't get the prize for 6 months after the contest, until I casually mentioned that in a comment on the Flutter subreddit. They saw my comment, came back to me within hours and I got my prize that week. Just to say that my encounters with Google haven't been great the past year.

What should my next steps be? I've read online a bit on appeals but most people say they get an automated answer that tells them to never try that again.

Anyone has any idea what is going on? This seems to be widespread issue.   
Couple of our apps are gone from play store and I got a mini heart-attack. 

I immediately logged in and everything is as usual. No warnings or emails or any kind of notifications.   


Does anyone has some info on what the fuck is going on?

Every developer who monetizes with ads has a headache about eCPMs they get. Some devs simply stick to traditional solutions (Admob, Mopub, etc), others are trying to find any alternatives to the one they’re using. As you may know already, key eCPM drivers are a number of demand partners, high fill rates and header bidding technology. Additional features such as immediate payouts and wide range of ad formats could encourage you to check out Appodeal mediation today.

I want only 18+ users to download my app. It's not explicit content or anything, so Google only gave it a "3+" rating.

Is there any way I can manually make it 18+?
