I'm writing docs for a library and would like to find a way to turn my \`props\` into a simple markdown table. Every example I've seen so far feels too complex, and creates a whole docs website for me.

Is there a way to turn this:

```typescript
type Props = {
  /*
   * this is a required color!
   */
  color: string
}
```

into this:

| Prop  | description  | type  | Required  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  color | this is a required color!  | string  | yes |

Hi guys!

I am struggling with understanding when to use the different operators. I have one method where I first subscribe to check if a service is online if it is then I subscribe to another observable. If not I show a dialogue saying service is down. What I have done is something like this:

    public methodName(parameter: parameterName): any {
            this.nameOfService
                .isServiceOnline()
                .pipe(
                    concatMap(isOnline =&gt; {
                        if (!isOnline) {
                            this.showServiceDownDialog();
                            return;
                        }
    
                        do stuff
    
                        return this.nameOfService.searchInService(parameter);
                    })
                )
                .subscribe(
                    data =&gt; {
                        do more stuff
                    }
                );
        }

Does this look ok? I used concatMap because I guess I want to make sure the service is online before I try to use the search method? Or is there any other operator I should use here?
## [10][Making a 3rd Party Interface more strict](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fpc17j/making_a_3rd_party_interface_more_strict/)

Hi. I am importing a 3rd party library (xml-parser) that returns an instance of the following interface from a function

    export interface Attributes {
        [name: string]: string;
    }

In my code I'd like to be able to project into a stricter type because I know the attributes returned will have certain property names e.g.

    type UserInfo = {
      username: string
    }

However assigning something of interface Attributes to a const of type UserInfo, rightly, doesn't compile. 

Is there a utility type that I can use to say this Attribute interface can be utilised like UserInfo? I tried Pick&lt;Attributes, 'username'&gt; but again username doesn't exist on the Attribute type.

I just came across this post [https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37448](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37448)...

Does anyone have the problem here? Are there any strategies you'd found to overcome it?
