**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

## [7][Can const-correctness be achieved for pointer wrapper types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h87gc0/can_constcorrectness_be_achieved_for_pointer/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h87gc0/can_constcorrectness_be_achieved_for_pointer/
---
Hello!

I'm wondering if there's any way to get a const-correct pointer wrapper type in C++?  

```
class Foo {
  Foo* next = nullptr;
public:
  Foo* getNext() { return next; }
  const Foo* getNextConst() const { return next; }
};

int main() {
  // This works as expected
  Foo foo; 
  foo.getNext();
  foo.getNextConst();
  // This works as expected too
  const Foo fooConst;
  fooConst.getNext(); // error!
  fooConst.getNextConst(); 
  // This shouldn't be possible. This is what I want to solve (const T to T, copy that allows one to access Foo's mutable members)
  foo = fooConst;
  // However, I'd like to keep those working:
  fooConst = fooConst;
  foo = foo;
  fooConst= foo;
}
```
This looks easy, right, remove the copy constructor? Well, no, I'd like to keep it. Ideally, I want this to behave just like a pointer would:

* Copy of T to const T is allowed.
* Copy of T to T is allowed.
* Copy of const T to const T is allowed.
* Copy of const T to T is forbidden.

Is there any way to do this in C++ ? I doubt it, but maybe someone has a solution?

I managed to write something (https://pastebin.com/8ekHJZYv) using `operator=`, it ticks all the boxes but it doesn't support the constructor, so ` const Foo otherConst = fooConst` doesn't work, it's the closest I can get. It'd be an acceptable quirk, but I still want to do better.

Other solutions I can think of:

* Use a base class "ConstFoo" that'd contain all of the immutable stuff. It's not pretty, I personally don't like it. It's fine for a single object, but if I want to apply this to a large number of classes, it'll be unmanageable.
* Drop const-correctness entirely for such object, and accept they'll never be const correct.
## [8][How much faster can a 4 by 4 matrix on the stack be as opposed to being on the heap?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h830sj/how_much_faster_can_a_4_by_4_matrix_on_the_stack/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h830sj/how_much_faster_can_a_4_by_4_matrix_on_the_stack/
---
So, if I create the matrix as float* m = new float[16]; , it is on the heap. But if it's float[16] m = {0}; (not sure if this initalization is correct), it's on the stack. How much faster can the second option be, seeing that I don't need to allocate again on the heap when copying?

Hello guys, just began a new game with C++ modules (MSVC 2019 Preview), made this simple python script to successfully build many .ixx and .cpp files into executable without tracking them by hand.  


Feel free to try (tested only on MSVC 2019 Preview). You just need to set path to vsvars.bat file to let the pyton script setup Visual Studio environment then run make.py.
