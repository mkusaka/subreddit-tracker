It's one of my bigger web applications i made lately and i want to share it with you. 

In this app you are able to trade us stocks using virtual money. You start with $100k. It has thousands of stocks, every stock has his own chart. Max chart range is 2 years. Sometimes when it comes to loading 1d chart you will see an error that's because i am using alpha vantage api for that and it has limited requests per minute so sorry for that. App is mostly reponsive. App has 2 themes default is dark theme and i don't recommend using the light one i didn't spend much time working on it. There is one test account available but i recommend creating an account with fake email for full experience. Feel free to test it. Have fun!

I wonder how to do something like this. The question is not really about React but the website is built with React. And I suppose someone from this community might have a clue. Thanks.

\*New to react\* For nesting routes with react-router. Can you unmount the previous content? 

    App.js
    &lt;Route path="/" component={HomePage} exact /&gt;
    &lt;Route path="/podcast/:pid" component={Podcast} /&gt;
    &lt;Route path="/podcast/:pid/episode/:eid" component={Episode} /&gt; 
    
    Podcast.js
    &lt;Link key={key} to={`/podcast/${this.state.id}/episode/${item.id}` }&gt;
    .
    .
    &lt;/Link&gt;

Homepage displays the top podcasts, then you press one you get to the podcast component and you see the episodes. Then when I press on a episode I want to arrive at a whole new page with a media player and so on but all the episode from the previous page is still there and the new content is rendered underneath everything else.

I'm trying to do an API request using Axios, it works in every windows' and Android browsers  but does not work on MacOs Safari (but in Chrome it works fine) or any iOs browser.

In the same code I make another calls to the same API (different endpoints) and it works with no problems at all in safari and iOs.

When I console.log the throwed exception turns out that's a Network error.

I don't think that's a CORS issue, couse it works on another browsers.

I'm sorry for my english, hope u guys can understand me.

Thanks.

My request:

`try {`  
 `const response = await api.get("/precos/get",`  
                `{`  
 `headers: {`  
 `'this.state-Type': 'application/json',`  
 `'token': getToken()`  
                    `}`  
                `});`  
 `//console.log("resultado do resquest preço" + response.data.data )`  
 `this.filtraProdutoPorTabela(response.data.data);`  
        `} catch (err)`

One of my biggest gripes with microservices is how few full-blown tutorials are available for something that is such a hot-topic technology.

As such, I recently built a rather simple Classifieds app using a Microservices architecture, using the following technologies as a non-exhaustive list:

* React;
* Redux;
* Node.js;
* GraphQL;
* Docker (and Docker Compose); and
* Styled Components,

And also deployed it into AWS using Terraform.

Here's the link to the full source code: [https://github.com/parkroolucas/microservices-demo](https://github.com/parkroolucas/microservices-demo)

And here's the link to the full tutorial series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-WutJH0qc&amp;list=PLnTRniWXnjf8YC9qJFLSVCrXfS6cyj6x6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-WutJH0qc&amp;list=PLnTRniWXnjf8YC9qJFLSVCrXfS6cyj6x6)

I'm trying to load Lightbox2

[https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#options)

I have included css in header and the js file in index.html of public/index.html in my React App

        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/lightbox.css"&gt;
        &lt;script src="/js/lightbox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

When I'm testing my webpage, I know that the above files load just fine by adding for example:

lightbox.css

    * {
    border: 5px solid black;
    }

and just a console.log("hello world"); on lightbox.js

&amp;#x200B;

On my React App I use the following code:

    &lt;a className="col-4" 
     href={"/media/docs/certs/" + item.credID + ".jpg"}
     data-lightbox="certificate-set"
     data-title={item.name + " Certificate"}
     data-alt={item.name + " Certificate"}&gt;
     {item.name + " Certificate"} 
    &lt;/a&gt;

and the result is this:

    &lt;a class="col-4" href="/media/docs/certs/4TEQWQJXR5GY.jpg" data-lightbox="certificate-set" data-title="Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python Certificate" data-alt="Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python Certificate"&gt;Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python Certificate&lt;/a&gt;

However, only links are being shown. I do not see any images

Hello, 

I need to create a website but i also want the ability to use it from mobile.

From what i understand i have 2 options:

1. Use react to make a website, and make sure it is responsive for mobile as well
2. Use react and make website and then separately make app using react native  


I have about 2 months to work on this therefore i think the second option is not possible.(correct me if i'm wrong)

For the first option, how will i know to make it responsive for mobile + desktop.   
Can someone point me to a certain tutorial?

Basically i want to build a social network style website.

Please let me know of your opinions and if i am missing an option.

Thanks
