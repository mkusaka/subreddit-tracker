**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

Howdy, Computer Science student here

I am taking a Data Structures and Algorithms in c++ class next semester and I am wondering if there are any free or cheap courses online that I can take to prepare for it. Any help is appreciated, thank you!

C++ compilation time is killing my productivity and will probably by my #1 reason of not using this language anymore. Can you share any tips that you used to lower the compilation time of your c++ projects ?

Anything is welcome: optimizing any step of the compilation (header, template instantiation, link, ...), tools, hardware, build systems, not using expensive language features, compilation time profiler ...

If you propose a tip, please follow this guideline as much as you can:

* Overall description
* Speedup observed on your project
* All steps to reproduce your tip (command lines, code, hardware specs,...)
* Why does it reduce compilation time ?
* What is the conditions to observe the same speedup or what type of projects won't benefit from you tip ?

If this thread is successful, one next step would be to gather all tips in a git repository and maintain it by asking r/cpp for PRs maybe once or twice per year.

I have a BSc in Computer Science, and want to learn modern C++. I usually learn by doing projects and reading about the areas and problems I encounter, but I have trouble finding somewhere to read about best practices and examples with modern C++.

Hello everyone,

My wife is taking an "introduction to programming" class next semester, where the curriculum starts with "hello world" and ends with "nested for loops". She won't be going further than that in programming, it's solely for the requirements for her degree in genetics.

I'm a developer, but it's been 15 years since I used c++ so i have no idea about the current development environments.

What's the basic software setup for her laptop? Compiler? IDE? 

During the summer I'll be teaching her the basics of programming, and she'll watch some tutorials too. I want her to get acquainted with writing basic stuff and compiling. I'm looking for the easiest setup for her convenience.

She will stop using c++ once she passes her class, so anything too advanced or future-proof is unnecessary.

Thanks for any help!
