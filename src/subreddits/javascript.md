**A)** What are the strength of Javascript over C#, Java, Python or Php and is it the best programming language to learn in 2020 for webdev ? Do you feel the others are getting outdated or less popular ? 

**B)** How's JS performance today compare to the others tech stack ? (interpreted vs compiled, single thread vs multi-threads etc) Are you guys worried about Web Assembly and the performance of C/C++ coming to webdev ?

**C)** Why there is so much hate/disdain toward Javascript from programmer of other tech stack like C# / Java for example ? is it because they are stuck with their old 80’s concept and OO mentality and they have trouble with functional programming and the new stuffs ?

I made a twitch bot some time ago I want to get any feedback on any flaws, feature requests, code style or just anything.

Main features are:

* Storing user information in local JSON database.
* Configure custom commands and responses.
* Configure custom periodic messages.
* Betting system.
