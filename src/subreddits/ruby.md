## [2][Pass a struct with a string field to a native library from Ruby, with pre-initialized string field, via FFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jdwkmz/pass_a_struct_with_a_string_field_to_a_native/)

FFI gem.

&amp;#x200B;

I have ruby code which passes a struct to a native Rust library. A struct contains a string field. I need to be able to specify string on Ruby side.

            class MyStruct &lt; FFI::Struct
              layout :s1, :string,
                     :field2, :uint32,
                     # other fields

I've tried this:

             def initialize(ruby_str)
               self[:s1] = ruby_str
               # [.......]

And have gotten this:

        `[]=': Cannot set :string fields (ArgumentError)

And this blows segmentation fault:

        def initialize(ruby_str)
          p1 = FFI::MemoryPointer.from_string(ruby_str)
          self[:content] = p1
          self[:len] = ruby_str.length

&amp;#x200B;

I've read about this issue, but I've not found a clear solution, nor example. I need to be able to pass a string field **at least from Ruby (one way, that is)**.

&amp;#x200B;

And, additionally, also convert a string  received from a native Rust library (not NULL terminated, but with a length specified in a separate field) into a Ruby string.

&amp;#x200B;

How can it be done then?

Hello!

I was using Ruby quite extensively few years ago, I believe I got good grasp of it. I had some break because every company I worked for in the meantime was \*Pythonized\*. I would like to get back to this beautiful technology - and get to know all the good stuff that happened in between. I was thinking of reading a book on Ruby, cover to cover. Which would you recommend to me? I'd like it to cover at least Ruby 2.5. 

Caveat: I'm not interested in RoR at all, I just enjoy using Ruby as a scripting language over Python. I'm a C++ / Rust developer.
