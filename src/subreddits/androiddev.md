Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I found few issues in commands in documentation to battery historian: https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/setup-battery-historian

Does anyone know is there a way to report them somewhere or to someone?

The issues are:

1) In the last steps there is command:

docker --run -p port_number:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian:2.1 --port 9999

Which a) uses 2.1 version, when in the beginning it shows 3.0 b) uses "--run", which won't work, as just "run" needed.

As a workaround need to ignore this line and use:

docker run -p port_number:9999 gcr.io/android-battery-historian/stable:3.0 --port 9999

2) Dump battery stats seems redundant

adb shell dumpsys batterystats &gt; [path/]batterystats.txt

It for sure was used in old times, but from the doc we now should use adb bugreport, and resulting batterystats.txt seems not used. I'd either remove that or added explanation on why it is needed

3) Getting bugreport in 7.0 or higher is written as:

adb bugreport &gt; [path/]bugreport.zip

It is incorrect. One would expect to get bugreport into bugreport.zip, but actually what you'll get is bugreport zip file with autogenerated name and result of executing command in your bugreport.zip (which will be corrupted as it is not really a zip).
Correct command is without &gt;

adb bugreport [path/]bugreport.zip

This is if you want to provide file name. But easier to use just:

adb bugreport

And name will be generated automatically and unambiguously.

It would be great to have some PR system for docs (if Android team can't keep them fresh), because such a number of issues on one page is embarrassing.

But at least maybe there is some channel where we can communicate issues for them to be reviewed and fixed?

PS: many years ago there was a python script which was processing batterystats.txt into html. Now one have to setup docker (instead of this to be integrated e.g. into Android Studio), sigh

I've recently noticed my [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guyca.kippi) crashes in a few scenarios tested in Google's pre-launch report. I did fix that crash, and have quite a few warning related to accessibility. I'm now wondering -  Does this report generate a hidden metric which impacts how google promotes my app in suggestions, search results etc?

## [6][Strategies for using Paging Library with offline cache while providing different sorting options?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f3khgq/strategies_for_using_paging_library_with_offline/)

It seems to me like the Paging Library just isn't built with this simple use case in mind. Say I have an app that searches IMDB for movie releases. Upon first load, it will fetch the first page of movies (perhaps 50 of the most recent movies) and correctly display them. Then say the user wants to search for the most popular movies of all time.  First it will sort the original 50 movies by popularity, and only after these have been displayed will the BoundaryCallback try to grab more from the API. This is clearly a poor user experience.

Or say my initial search is for movies from June 2019. Then I decide to search for movies from all of 2019. In this case, the Paging Library will show the June movies first (because that's what's in the offline cache), before the BoundaryCallback tries to fetch anything else.

Is Paging Library just not meant to handle this?

Newbie here. I'm planning to make an app which will contain 50+ large image files.  Do I have to put them all in the drawables folder? I've read that you can't put sub-folders in the drawables folder. Can I put my files somewhere else and how would I reference them from the activity.

How do you organize the image files in your apps?
