We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello everyone
I just got a job as a Frontend developer at a startup company.
Their product is an ecommerce fashion app.
But I'm not very confident as I feel ecommerce apps are usually more complex and I haven't worked on or built an ecommerce app before. So I thought I should ask for some guidelines from people with experience on building ecommerce apps with React  and also some design patterns and architectures that I should follow in order to help me deliver.
## [5][useEffect deep search doesnt work](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ewntsm/useeffect_deep_search_doesnt_work/)

I am using a useEffect hook with 2 dependencies to make API calls. I want to make API calls according to multiple checkboxes selected so one of my dependencies in the hooks is props.mydata whose structure is like :

{
     Key1 : ["a","b","c","d"],
     Key2: ["e","f"]
}

Now useEffect gets only called once probably because it doesnt deep search the overall object(&amp;array?) for changes. How to go about it? I want to call the useEffect fn when lets say "a" gets removed or if "g" gets added with one of the keys.

So i'm still learning and i'm totally lost in what is the best one for me to focus.

I do know PHP and Laravel but i was wondering if i should learn node or angular to use with React because is the same language.

&amp;#x200B;

I still getting a bit confused when i write in two different languages that's why i'm not really that comfortable using Laravel as back-end.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys suggest?
