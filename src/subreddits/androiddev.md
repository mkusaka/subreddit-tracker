This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

The 27th I made an app udpdate (for an existing app) which was published in less than 24h. The last time the app had been updated before that was about 1 month.
 Then the 28th, a few hours after that update was published, I had to push a hot fix app update. To this day (3 days later), it is still not published. Could it be because it was pushed very quick after another update and it got into some waiting queue ? Did anybody experience something like this ? Usually all my updates are published very fast, but this is the first time I make a quick hotfix update.

I've my app ([Task Nearby: Location reminder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.tasknearby.yashcreations.com.tasknearby)) live in Play store since May 2015. Around Jan 2018, with the help of a friend I revamped the app and optimized the store listing and title to rank amongst the top for keywords like "Location reminder".

Few days ago, I noticed that someone has created another app with the name - "[Nearby Tasks - Location reminders](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weenggs.remindmeatlocation)" which apart from using the almost similar name, has the exact same store listing! The developer just removed the lines from store listing for the features that are not there in their app.

The app, though it builds on the same ideas and features present in my app (e.g. notes, recurring reminders, image attachment), has a different UI - so I cannot call it a clone.

Now the app is ranking at the top for these keywords and is just next to my app. This is confusing the potential customers when they try to search my app by name. Also, I'm not really happy seeing my work being copied by someone and used for their benefit.

I do not have any trademark or copyright over the title or store listing. I tried reporting this to Google [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) but as expected, I got no response. 

I think there's nothing that can be done here, but thought of asking the community if there's anything that could be done?

It uses bottom navigation as well as a left and right gestures to display a menu on the left a list in the middle and details on the right.

I'd quite like to use that in my project.Did anyone try to reproduce this behaviour?

[Slack application](https://reddit.com/link/gsrm3w/video/4809o6j95p151/player)

 

We can see it feels different but it is hard to qualify what it is exactly.

So I spent some time trying to spot some of the differences.

When you flick to the right a drawer appears.

Compared to a regular drawer there are several differences.

1 - you can drag from anywhere on the screen. Generally the drawer is only accessible from the far left.

2 - when you scroll the left drawer to the right, the center panel darkens a little bit and follows it pixel for pixel to the right . Generally it only darkens and stays put.

3 - the left drawer is totally full height including the Pixel notch on top. On other apps it generally covers the title bar but not the system icons above.

The right drawer is similar but a little bit different.

1 - you can also drag from anywhere on the screen. Generally the right drawer is only accessible from the far right.

2 - when you scroll the right drawer to the left, the center panel darkens a little bit and follows to the left just ever so slightly. Perhaps 30 pixels. Generally it only darkens and stays put.

3 - the right drawer is totally full height too.

4 - there is a non linear animation of the background, I wonder if someone can qualify it better.

Do you think it would improve the ecosystem if the play store was paying devolopers of free apps?
As they take a percentage of each sale at buying time. Wouldn't it make sense to give some of this money back to free apps based on usage? 
This would encourage free apps development and provide free possibly ad free apps for the ecosystem.
