## [5][Module suffixes problem - VSCode refactoring/servers not using ".js" ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejw340/module_suffixes_problem_vscode_refactoringservers/)

Hi ðŸ‘‹ **Problem**:  I'm using es2015 modules, and targeting web browsers. When I move .ts files in VSCode, the updated module import paths will not have a .js suffix. E.g.: I had a module reference:

* "/js/event.js", upon move to a new directory, the reference was update to
* "/js/util/event"

In other [VSCode extention](https://github.com/stringham/move-ts.git)s to move and refactor files they also seem to use no suffix. I'm using IIS or the *python -m http.server* command to test my code, and these seem to have no easy way to automatically rewrite all /thing to /thing.js.

What am I missing? The servers don't seem to like the syntax VSCode gives, yet I find no way to change the settings so the refactoring retains the .js suffix. Are modules generated by typescript usually not served as .js? If so, what servers should I be using?

Sorry for the broad scope of this question, but it's causing me some issues. I've searched for the answer and also tried rewrite rules.

\---

**Update**: seems there is no easy way to alter this refactoring behavior, but using webpack might be a solution, and one that does not require a large build pipeline and loads of dependencies. Thanks guys!

**Update 2**: the following webpack command makes debugging work as well, though you get the .js source maps instead of the .ts `webpack --entry .\js\main.js -o library.js --mode development --watch --devtool source-map`

## [8][Top-level await in TS 3.8 Nightly Build?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejgajz/toplevel_await_in_ts_38_nightly_build/)

I'm trying to use top-level await in a TS 3.8. I installed the dev release from today (1/3/20). 

When writing typescript it continues to complain: "'await' expression is only allowed within an async function. (TS1308) when I run tsc.

Am I missing some step to allow top-level await?
## [9][Node CLI startup cache: any other projects like this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejo4ez/node_cli_startup_cache_any_other_projects_like/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ejo4ez/node_cli_startup_cache_any_other_projects_like/

I have an idea for a project to improve startup of CLI tools written in TypeScript / JavaScript via aggressive caching and lazy-loading of dependencies, without requiring pre-compilation or webpacking.  The idea is to hit a sweet-spot between CLI performance and developer experience.

* use `bundleDependencies` to lock all dependency versions.
* cache all `require.resolve()` results, all `fs.readFileSync()` related to loading modules
* cache all `ts.transpileModule()` results from `ts-node`.
* A bit of Proxy magic to lazy-load imports automatically, without code changes.
* Include v8-compile-cache

Effectively, code can be written to use ts-node in the simplest way possible.  At development time, this will "just work" without a compile step.  Production releases will automatically create a cache after the first startup.  For subsequent startups, a single cache file is loaded, after which everything is a cache hit in memory.  No more fs calls, no transpiler calls.

Anyone know of a project that already does this?

So far everything I've seen does not take this approach.  They either:

a) bundle it all into a new node binary.  
b) webpack, which can cause weird breakages, incompatibilities, and debugging issues.

Hey -- 

I'm new to Typescript.  

I created this class:

 [https://github.com/NickHodges/TSGuard/blob/master/Guard.ts](https://github.com/NickHodges/TSGuard/blob/master/Guard.ts) 

is this useful in Typescript, or am I wasting my time?

I can, of course, expand on it.
