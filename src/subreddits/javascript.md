Hello,

I am trying to learn how to work with OAUTH and the Twitch API and their documentation says I need to provide a redirect URI and I have no idea what this means, and what am I supposed to do. I have tried Googling this and attempting to find an example script that includes a redirect but no real luck.

Can someone help me out with this, please? Just hit me with a message or here. I am looking for an actual JS code example.
