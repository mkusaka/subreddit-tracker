We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello,

I have been trying to install React in my PC frfom past 24 hours and couldn't do it.  
I followed the following procedure:

1) node.js in C drive  
2) node version 12.16.1  
3)npm version 6.14.2  
4) Windows 10  
5) then I followed: npx create-react-app my-app  
6) cd my-app  
7) npm start

But the following errors show up when I hit npm start

`&gt; my-app@0.1.0 start C:\Users\mohin\my-app`

`&gt; react-scripts start`

&amp;#x200B;

`i ï½¢wdsï½£: Project is running at` [`http://192.168.1.33/`](http://192.168.1.33/)

&amp;#x200B;

I tried deleting node-modules and reinstalling and even cleared catche.  
I tried every way I know but I couldn't find solution

I thought it was showing error for LIVE SERVER step so maybe I can still use it without live server but when i open index.html in public folder there is no output.

Please help me.

I really want to learn in this break quickly.

Hello.

Which Bootstrap Library should I use?

I started with React Bootstrap and I found some features are missing.

and then I search and I found about MDBootstrap, ReactStrap etc..

Which one do you recommend?
