## [4][Why Android Gradle documentation sucks and feels like it is not updated frequently?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hghzs8/why_android_gradle_documentation_sucks_and_feels/)

I don't know much about Gradle for Android

I am really trying to learn something from this documentation [https://developer.android.com/studio/build](https://developer.android.com/studio/build) but I feel it is just an unordered piece of \*\*\*\* that just mention some "tips" put in some legacy type of documentation

I thought that it can be some just ordered type of documentation when you learn stuff incrementally. But in this type of documentation it is really hard to understand some topic, when it includes several types of information (considered even advanced) from other topic.

What is more I feel that this documentation is not updated frequently

For example:

\- here [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies) not mention anything about kapt which is required for Kotlin code

\- here [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/optimize-your-build#optimize](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/optimize-your-build#optimize) mentioning something about Android Studio 2.3 (really?)

&amp;#x200B;

It is really totally pushing me away when try to learn something from it and I give up

Do you guys know some good source from which I can learn Gradle for Android?
## [5][I want to fire off a notification when entering a room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hgs7d6/i_want_to_fire_off_a_notification_when_entering_a/)

I basically want to make a function where If you go into a room (doesn't have to be super accurate) a notification can fire.  

I am just not sure which way to go.  I was thinking anything from something like an RFID in the room or could an alexa, echo dot or other device solve this? I would prefer cheaper hardware if possible.

Or could I use just the phone alone to say "when you get 10 feet near this point in space, fire a notification.  I don't need insane accuracy like realtime tracking but I would like to denote if someone goes into one room vs another.  

Is there a platform for this already? Just having a hard time figuring out what would make the most sense to start with.

[If you go to the Firebase Authentication guide it directly contradicts having one activity.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/phone-auth?fbclid=IwAR0Do4bdXfPA8_YXAigjxguUe2VQ7aWpEPp3xsaFr0cfJYAPrM1YkJx3mT8#kotlin+ktx) It uses PhoneAuthentication as it's own activity? Is this recommended or just outdated, and on top of that they write all their business logic in the Activity. So what's the deal? Auth Management is tricky as hell to manage the "right way" did they also just say screw it throw it all in an activity because it's easier.

I am trying to use the RxJava caching mechanism but i can't seem to  catch how it works or how can i control the cached contents since there  is the `cache` operator.

I want to verify the cached data with some conditions before emitting the new data.

for example

    someObservable.
    repeat().
    filter { it.age &lt; maxAge }.
    map(it.name).
    cache() 

There is also `ObservableCache&lt;T&gt;` class but i can't find any resources of using it.

how can i get the cached content and verify it (or do any operation on it) before emitting a new value

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

We have different types of Android Context, and sometimes developers get confused about which Context to use ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
More than that, wrong context usage can lead to problems, for example, memory leaks üòï

Master the Android Context and use it correctly.

We are looking to buy installs from the top non-self attributing video ad networks i.e. UnityAds, Vungle, etc. and are looking for any recommendations or inside knowledge about attribution partners from those that may already be doing so. If you are open to discussing which genre your app/game is in, and any experiences you may have using attribution partners and non-SAN networks for your UA, please feel free to connect with us via DM.

## [12][Should I continue to learn native development with kotlin](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hgcfou/should_i_continue_to_learn_native_development/)

I am quite new to android development and have beem developing apps with kotlin for a 6 moths now.
But I am concerned that when Fuchsia arrives, all the things I have learnt will go useless.
Moreover there's is always a chance that with tools like react native, native app development may not be required.
What are your views regarding the demand of native app development in the future?
