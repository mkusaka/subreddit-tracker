Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ekpqp7/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Some observations from a three years of contributions to Servo, on the following topics:

\- Community works

\- Incremental progress works

\- The native thread is dead, long live the native thread!

Why doesn't it return the same String type?

UPDATE: Well, because you all were so willing to help and comment this post popped up in his feed. The jig is up!! He's SUPPOSED TO BE STUDYING for exams so I thought I could fly under the radar! But so it goes, he really appreciated it and we both appreciate all the jokes and suggestions you guys provided! I honestly learned a ton, can't say I won't be back for some other help... (Also I have a little something else up my sleeve and I've made him promise not to go snooping) 

If people are still interested I can post what I do make, though it probably won't be rust related! Thank you again for being so sweet and amazing and helping me so much!!!

Hey everyone! 

I'm looking for the best rust puns/jokes you can manage! My boyfriend loves rust, as well as a few other languages. Due to a couple different things he's having a rough time in life at the moment. I wanted to make something that would give him a laugh and hopefully help him feel a bit better. My plan is to find an amazing and terrible pun/joke and embroider it on a t-shirt for him! 

I am of course not a programmer so I have no idea where else to turn for these. I've enlisted his friends for final approval and to make sure they actually make sense (because I have no idea!) Hopefully he doesn't follow this sub... 

Thank you for your help!

Hey, I'd like to announce my first crate :))) - caretaker. It watches for the changes in the filesystem and based on them executes the provided command. Can be use to automatically run unit tests, minify files or whatever.
It is very simple to configure via a TOML file, such as:

    [[watch]]
    name = "print hello"
    path = "src"
    command = "echo \"hello world\""

    [[watch]]
    name = "compile sass"
    path = "sass"
    command = "sassc -t compressed sass/style.scss static/style.css"

A couple of times recently, we've come across .rs files in our codebase, which are not actually used (ie. there is no corresponding \`mod\` declaration in the crate). It would be nice to catch these early, as it is nearly always a mistake.

Before we look at writing a tool, does anything already exist like this?
