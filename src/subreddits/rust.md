Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

I know that Microsoft has been porting some of [iotedge](https://github.com/azure/iotedge) over to rust, although it is still predominantly C#. I have seen a few blog posts which have been talking about porting parts of the windows kernel over to rust, but I have seen no specifics. I also saw in the [Microsoft GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=Rust&amp;type=&amp;language=rust) a few projects using rust, but I wanted to know if there was anything else.

I'm a new rustacean.   In the tradition of \`bat\`, \`rg\`, etc I'm working on a dig replacement written in rust.   So far it does the basics: you can get pretty-printed DNS replies for most of the common RRtypes.  I'd love feedback or pull requests or other help on my hobby project:

## [12][Confusion with Rust's async architecture and how tokio fits in](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f10tcq/confusion_with_rusts_async_architecture_and_how/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f10tcq/confusion_with_rusts_async_architecture_and_how/

I'm really psyched about rust. It seems to be a perfect too to add to a performance-concious dev's toolkit. I come from a strong C# background and have basically eaten .NET's async/await funtionality for breakfast lunch and dinner for the past few years.

So I'm reading about rust and how a very similar async/await functionality is available, only with some important differences. I'm hoping someone can clear up some questions:

1

Rust boasts not having a runtime. While looking into getting async IO going I came accross tokio. Seems cool. A little strange that a library is needed to expose async APIs on STD objects but whatevs. So I'm reading about tokio and I come across this: 

&gt;A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications.

Wha? A runtime? But... I thought...

Why is a runtime required for functionality that is baked into the language. I know I can use async/await without *any* libraries, tokio just provides the APIs for stuff like sockets.

2

If I write a library using tokio, I'm not going to include a #\[tokio::main\]. Soooo.... Where does the runtime get started if someone uses my library in their project, but doesn't use the tokio main?

3

I'm sure someone will come up with a solution to #2, and I'll have my runtime running without #\[tokio::main\] but then that begs the question: What if the person using my library has some *other* async runtime they are using. Does that mean both tokio and runtime\_x are going to be running? That seems ridiculous!
