Hi all,

I wanted to let everyone know about [Ruby by the Bay](https://rubybythebay.org/), the west coast version of Ruby for Good that will be happening in the SF area April 3 - April 6. Put simply, we gather a bunch of rubyists and javascripters (along with anyone else interested in doing good) and we get together for a long weekend (Fri - Mon) of using our awesome skills to build apps for social and civic good organizations. Last year we built applications for diaper banks, Refuge Restrooms, animal shelters, and many other great places. We're focusing on projects this year that affect our environment -- organizations that cater to those doing the important work of saving our planet.

The event is all inclusive, meaning that we stay in dorms, all the food is provided and we have pretty decent internet too. Our days are filled with hacking and our evenings are full of excellent camaraderie -- playing boardgames, video games, karaoke, werewolf, cards and lots of excellent socializing!

We are excited to announce that we're going to be holding the event at [Naturebridge](https://naturebridge.org/locations/golden-gate) in Marin County.

You can find more information about this years' event here: [https://rubybythebay.org/attend](https://rubybythebay.org/attend) Here is a list of the most frequently asked questions here: [https://rubybythebay.org/faq](https://rubybythebay.org/faq)

I'd be delighted to answer any questions.

Happiness,

Sean (and the rest of the Ruby by the Bay team)

PS - We'd love any sponsorship if anyone knows of anyone who may be interested sponsoring our event this year!
