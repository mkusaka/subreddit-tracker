Hi all,

I'm the main author of [The JavaScript Way](https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway), an open source book about JS written in 2017. It was pretty well received upon publication and gathered almost 7k GitHub stars since.

Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain it properly.
That's why I'm looking for help to keep this book up-to-date and relevant. Ideally, I'd like to step down and leave room for a new maintainer, or a team thereof.

Feel free to get in touch with me for more details. Thanks in advance!

I saw an explanation of yarn v2.0 and I was wondering if someone is planning to use it in production.

I also saw that companies like FB and Twitter are not planning to upǵrade their codebase because the Pnp feature of it.
