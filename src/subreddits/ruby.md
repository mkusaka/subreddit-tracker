Hello!

Wouldn’t it be great to have a place where we can share our valuable insights,due diligence and news with whom we want when we want.

I’m building an app to which other programmers can hook there apps into. The app also has a polling bot (on earnings for example) news, messaging, an earnings calendar which will be customizable to the companies you follow.

It’s still a work in progress but if you would like to subscribe for when it’s finished please let me know. Or If you want to help/contribute to build this beautiful beast then also let me know at [securecollaborationplatform@gmail.com](mailto:securecollaborationplatform@gmail.com)

In this article, we consider a solution using the SQL view to avoid query problem N+1 when calculating the average values in Ruby on Rails application.

I'm rather new to using ruby so I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. I have received an asciidoctor document and I need to convert it to either html. or pdf to make it readable. I have been advised to use Ruby API for that but so far I have been unsuccessful in doing that (once I try running it I get an error saying "Failed to load AsciiDoc document - source is either binary or contains invalid Unicode data"). Could someone direct me on to the right track?
## [9][Rails 6 and parallel tests: get ID/number of current executor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gqtb9m/rails_6_and_parallel_tests_get_idnumber_of/)

I need to try something with Capybara to attempt to solve an issueand I need to set a different server port for each executor when I am using parallel tests. With old parallelisation gems you could use the env variable TEST_ENV_NUMBER to get a different number for each executor process, but that doesn't seem to work with Rails' own parallel tests and I can't find anything similar. Any idea? Thanks

This ruby subreddit has 65.4k members, while the Python one has 581k members, why is the python community almost 10x as large as ruby?
