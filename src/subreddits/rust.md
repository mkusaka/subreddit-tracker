Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ji8ukt/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Welcome once again to the official /r/rust Who's Hiring thread!

Before we begin, job-seekers should also remember to peruse [the prior thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/iix8vw/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

This thread will be periodically stickied to the top of /r/rust for improved visibility. The thread will be refreshed and posted anew when the next version of Rust releases in six weeks.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting:
# Rules for individuals:

 * Don't create top-level comments; those are for employers.
 * Feel free to reply to top-level comments with on-topic questions.
 * Anyone seeking work should reply to my stickied top-level comment.
 * Meta-discussion should be reserved for the distinguished comment at the very bottom.

# Rules for employers:

 * To find individuals seeking work, see the replies to the stickied top-level comment; you will need to click the "more comments" link at the bottom of the top-level comment in order to make these replies visible.
 * To make a top-level comment you must be hiring directly; no third-party recruiters.
 * One top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
 * Proofread your comment after posting it and edit it if necessary to correct mistakes.
 * Please base your comment on the following template:

COMPANY: *[Company name; optionally link to your company's website or careers page.]*

TYPE: *[Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]*

DESCRIPTION: *[What does your company do, and what are you using Rust for? How much experience are you seeking and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details the better.]*

LOCATION: *[Where are your office or offices located? If your workplace language isn't English-speaking, please specify it.]*

ESTIMATED COMPENSATION: *[Be courteous to your potential future colleagues by attempting to provide at least a rough expectation of wages/salary. If you are listing several positions in the "Description" field above, then feel free to include this information inline above, and put "See above" in this field. If compensation is negotiable, please attempt to provide at least a base estimate from which to begin negotiations. If compensation is highly variable, then feel free to provide a range. If compensation is expected to be offset by other benefits, then please include that information here as well. If you don't have firm numbers but do have relative expectations of candidate expertise (e.g. entry-level, senior), then you may include that here. If you truly have no information, then put "Uncertain" here.* ***This is a new field in our template; please see the meta comment below to discuss it***.*]*

REMOTE: *[Do you offer the option of working remotely? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]*

VISA: *[Does your company sponsor visas?]*

I implemented this just for fun, learn Rust and to support some small features other CLI tools don't have.

## [8][Mutable closure as a function parameter](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jq5xvj/mutable_closure_as_a_function_parameter/)

Hello, I'm a Rust newbie trying to learn more about the language. I was messing around with closures and I ran into a problem. I'm trying to create a mutable closure and pass it as a parameter of a function, but it keeps returning type mismatch errors when calling verify(). Here's what I'm trying to get to work:

    fn main() {
        testo();
    }
    
    fn verify(closure: &amp;dyn FnMut(&amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str) -&gt; bool {
        closure("Hello");
        true
    }
    
    fn testo() {
        let mut value = "";
        let mut func = |newval| {
            value = newval;
            value
        };
        verify(&amp;func);
        println!("{}", value)
    }

Why doesn't testo() work in this example?

This algorithm can avoid generating flat graphics. 

The current algorithm will generate excessive lines, although they overlap and have no effect, but it would be better if the redundancy can be removed.

Still in development but currently supports `MS-SQL`, `MariaDB`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL` and `SQLite` databases that can be selected through a combination of `mysql_async`, `rusqlite`, `Sqlx (MS-SQL)`, `Sqlx (MariaDB/MySql)`, `Sqlx (PostgreSQL)`, `Sqlx (SQLite)`  or `tokio-postgres` libraries/features. I am also considering including Diesel support for `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL` and `SQLite` in the future.
