**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Hi, few days ago I started my own blog and wrote my first post.  My reason for starting a blog is to improve my writing skills since I am not a native English speaking person. Other reason is to have a place where I can store information that I find relevant. I would very much appreciate any kind of feedback.  


Thank you for time spent reading the material. I would also like to know what is your opinion on the topic.

## [5][STX: C++ 20 Error and Optional-Value Handling Library (Result, Option, Panics, and Backtracing)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gw14ke/stx_c_20_error_and_optionalvalue_handling_library/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gw14ke/stx_c_20_error_and_optionalvalue_handling_library/

Hello everyone,

I have been exploring and evaluating error-handling models across the C++ ecosystem for the past 3 months. Primarily because I needed a proper and deterministic error-handling model for fail-often systems (embedded systems) in which exceptions don't fit the bill **yet**. Even with some embedded toolchains not having an actual exception implementation. The overall reliability and security of these systems are highly impacted by the error-handling model.

From my exploration and interaction with other developers, I found that the **Result** and **Option** type monads were highly preferred to other models and are much more intuitive due to the error-handling logic abstraction, and the concise and deterministic success and failure paths they provide. In addition, many of the engineers had already rolled their in-house implementations.

Here are a **few** open-source projects that also replicate the same error-handling types/models: [LLVM's ErrorOr](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/llvm/include/llvm/Support/ErrorOr.h), [Mozilla MFBT's Result](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mfbt/Result.h), Fuchsia OS' [Result](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/zircon/system/ulib/zxc/), [StatusOr](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/zircon/system/ulib/intel-hda/include/intel-hda/utils/status_or.h), and [Panic](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/HEAD/zircon/system/public/zircon/assert.h), [Pigweed's Result](https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/pigweed/+/refs/heads/master/pw_result/), [Simdjson's Result](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/include/simdjson/error.h), etc. Another great approach is error-handling macros like [ENSURE\_OK, DCHECK\_OK, QCHECK\_OK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/status.h) which I came across during my open-source work on Tensorflow micro.

As with many cases of code duplication even within the same codebase, they can have really subtle bugs (i.e. Mozilla's Result).

Some programming languages adopt this functional approach i.e: Haskell (`Either`),  Scala (`Try` &amp; `Option`), Rust (`Result` &amp; `Option`).

**STX** (*standard-extended*) is a C++20 library that aims to unify these development efforts and make it easier to manage errors and also provide some development utilities.

# STX Library Features

* **Result&lt;T, E&gt;** and **Option&lt;T&gt;** (with monadic methods) and ***constexpr*** support
   * Local explicit error propagation (with `TRY_OK` &amp; `CO_TRY_OK`)
   * **std::error\_code** and *exception-object* compatible
   * fast and deterministic success and failure paths
   * errors and nullability can not be ignored implicitly
* Panics  (i.e. fail-fast abandonment)
   * Panic backtracing
   * Thread-safe runtime panic hooks (especially for DLL *drivers*)
   * Panic Handlers (reporting preference varies from project to project. i.e:  log to disk, log to *journal*, halting, etc)
   * Reporting
* \*Fatal signal backtracing (**SIGILL**, **SIGSEGV**, and **SIGFPE**)
* No **RTTI**, memory allocation, nor *exceptions*
* Manual backtracing library based on *Abseil*

I created a benchmark that tests a one compilation unit header only unity build vs a regular cpp build (h + cpp in individual compilation units).  I really hate writing headers so I prefer to do everything header only. The problem with header only is that every file gets rebuilt every time. This increases built times and becomes a chore.  I thought maybe a unity build would offset the time it takes to compile "everything" every time. The results show that a unity build even on header only source code reduced build time by a factor of 6 or 7.

I got pretty extensive in my testing. At one point I created a benchmark for a 1 mil LOC unity header only project and I was impressed to see it built in about 10 seconds. I didnt even try a full build of that for a regular cpp structure (cpp + header being compiled individually) lol.  However; incremental builds for a regular cpp structure  still beat most unity builds by a few seconds (depending on project size).  This goes to show that header only unity builds are fast enough to avoid writing header(declaration) files all together! So if you cant wait until modules finally get released, unity builds are definitely do-able as they are almost as speedy as incremental builds.

[https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template)

This is an update to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gt0pz1/i_made_a_project_template_for_modern_c_projects/), in which I shared with you [my modern C++ template](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template).

Everyone was kind enough to give me a lot of feedback on how, what and where to improve it and I wish to once more share it with you, with hopes that you will all be satisfied with its current state.

Once more I am asking for you opinions and I hope you find it useful!

## Features
  * Modern **CMake** configuration and project, which, to the best of my knowledge, uses the best practices,
  * An example of a **Clang-Format** config, inspired from the base *Google* model, with minor tweaks. This is aimed only as a starting point, as coding style is a subjective matter, everyone is free to either delete it (for the *LLVM* default) or supply their own alternative,
  * **Static analyzers** integration, with *Clang-Tidy* and *Cppcheck*, the former being the default option,
  * **Doxygen** support, through the `ENABLE_DOXYGEN` option, which you can enable if you wish to use it,
  * **Unit testing** support, through *GoogleTest* (with an option to enable *GoogleMock*) or *Catch2*,
  * **Code coverage**, enabled by using the `ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` option, through *Codecov* CI integration,
  * **Package manager support**, with *Conan* and *Vcpkg*, through their respective options
  * **CI workflows for Windows, Linux and MacOS** using *GitHub Actions*, making use of the caching features, to ensure minimum run time,
  * **.md templates** for: *README*, *Code of Conduct*, *Contributing Guideliness*, *Issues* and *Pull Requests*,
  * **Permissive license** to allow you to integrate it as easily as possible. The template is licensed under the [Boost Software License](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt),
  * Options to build as a header-only library or executable, not just a static or shared library.
  * *CCache* integration, for speeding up build times

Thank you to everyone who has supported me and I am very grateful for all the feedback you provided, as well as the opportunity to learn a lot of new things through it! I hope I am not posting too soon since the original, but I wanted to give everyone interested an updated. Hopefully you all find at least one thing that is useful for you, getting something in return for the long read!

Edit: formatting.

Edit 2: Updated with latest features/changes.

As a follow-up to the community survey we did earlier this year, we would now like to ask all of our users that are willing and able to publicly share details about their applications to comment on this issue on GitHub: [https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/4690](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/4690).

We are collecting this information at one hand for us to learn more about our users, but also for current and potential future users to be able to see what others are working on with HPX. We will eventually present this information on our website. If you are not able to share the details of an application, only mentioning the institution or company that is using HPX would also be helpful to us.

Thanks for your time!
