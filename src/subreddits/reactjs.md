## Want Help with your Code?

1. **Improve your chances** by adding a minimal example with [JSFiddle][jsfiddle], [CodeSandbox][code sandbox], or [Stackblitz][stackblitz].
    - Describe what you want it to do, and things you've tried. Don't just post big blocks of code!
    - **[Formatting Code][wiki formatting code]** wiki shows how to format code in this thread.
1. **Pay it forward!** Answer questions even if there is already an answer. Other perspectives can be helpful to beginners. Also, there's no quicker way to learn than [being wrong on the Internet][being wrong on the internet].

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey guys, so I've been applying for jobs for a month and all I get is "Thank you but we don't need you" and I'm really getting demotivated I tried to improve my resume and my portfolio but still no interview, so what's wrong guys? is it because I'm applying for remote jobs and remote jobs are harder to get or what? and what should I do?

and here's My [Portfolio](https://ahmedeid.netlify.app/) and My [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FgqB5RtutmHzYG1VYXbArig2YzY7q6WY/view)

My hope is that thereâ€™s enough people who like this because I really want to invest more time into making this site even better. Iâ€™m already using my editor to take notes in school and organize my college applications. Let me know what you all think!

If anyoneâ€™s interested in my stack, Iâ€™m using React for the frontend and a GraphQL API on Azure Functions that talks to a PostgreSQL database for the backend.

I noticed the use of classes v. functions in ReactJS. 2020 tutorials seem to use functions rather than classes. Is the use of classes in any way outdated? Even tutorials from 2019 use this method.

I don't know if this is a trivial or stupid question? However, it's really bugging me out that following two different tutorials using different methods make my code not compile. I feel that I'm missing something obvious.

This is my first time posting programming-related. I usually just lurk in programming subreddit and can usually find the answers in Reddit or Stack Overflow. But not this question.

Also, can anyone recommend me a good ReactJS course for a beginner that's updated? Thank you so much!

Hey guys, I was wondering what is the best way to test an useEffect api call? Is it by using Jest/Enzyme or are there better alternatives? Any help is appreciated!

I have completed 80% of the traversy media's MERN stack course on udemy. Project is good, but code quality is not up to the mark. Is there any course available which is project based and code quality and folder structure is very good?
## [12][Why do we need server side template engines like handlebar,pug in nodejs if we use react on the client side?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/izz0my/why_do_we_need_server_side_template_engines_like/)

I first learned react and now focusing on nodejs. After diving into express i just got overwhelmed with tons of template engines out there. I am still confused why on earth i have to run after those if i already use react on the  client side.
