We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I dont really need the extra money but should i freelance react development  outside of work and maybe move into full time in a few years?
## [4][Papyr CMS - a jumping off point so you don't have to reinvent the wheel](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hhyv4x/papyr_cms_a_jumping_off_point_so_you_dont_have_to/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hhyv4x/papyr_cms_a_jumping_off_point_so_you_dont_have_to/

Hello r/reactjs,

I have been working for a while on a project I have named Papyr CMS. Papyr is a content management system built on Next.js, making it an incredibly powerful web application for the end user and a easy to extend for the developer.

Besides everything that comes packaged with Next.js, key features that come out of the box include:

* A quick initialization process once the site is running to create the admin user and first page
* Customizable content
* A dynamic, extendable page builder and renderer for custom landing pages
* A selection of commonly used page sections for the page builder
* User authentication
* Site notifications
* Blog
* Events
* Ecommerce
* Google maps, Google analytics, Gmail, Stripe, and Cloudinary integration,
* Contact and donation forms

While I did not hit everything in that list, many of those features are common and necessary for most web applications and websites, making Papyr a perfect jumping-off point to build an even more robust web application, or to simply spin up a quick website.

You can visit the home website at [https://papyrcms.herokuapp.com](https://papyrcms.herokuapp.com). Since great content is not necessarily my specialty, I have also created an example website with dummy content to show off more of what Papyr is capable of at [https://drkgrntt.herouapp.com](https://drkgrntt.herouapp.com). Check out the code at [https://github.com/drkgrntt/papyr-cms](https://github.com/drkgrntt/papyr-cms). 

While Papyr is designed to be super easy for developers to spin up a site and extend it easily, I have also tried to keep the non-developer client in mind as I build it. I have tried to keep it as simple as I can, but there is still the major issue of the setup process being non-dev-unfriendly (connecting to MongoDB and Heroku, etc). It is far from complete, but at this point, I feel like it is presentable and definitely usable.

While I am mostly looking for feedback right now, if you think this is cool or useful, please feel free to clone and use it. Setup instructions are in the readme. I would love to answer any questions as well!

Thanks for reading!

Hi guys! I want to build a React application consisting of a registration form and some landing pages. Now what would be nice is if the marketing team can easily create or edit landing pages using some kind of editor. All those Headless CMS  work really well for structured data like blogs. But landing pages have different styles and different content.  Do you know something appropriate for this kind of job ?

I usually love Stephen Grider's courses, but I was disappointed by his React Native course, because the UI looked completely shit and it's probably even more important than how the app is engineered since it's what managers care about the most in the end. Is there any better course? I tried Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's course and didn't like it very much.

Howdy,

Currently learning react so I don't have any professional experience working on projects.

Can anyone point me in the right direction for how to properly structure a react project that doesn't make me look like a complete noob.

Typically strucutre like this - might be wrong/bad please let me know how to up my organisation game (very basic outline but can view [here](https://github.com/MitchAhoy/react-google-calc)) 

* Project
   * public
      * index.html
   * src
      * components (folder)
      * \-----dashboard (folder)
      * \-----------------Dashboard.js
      * helpers (folder)
      * index.js
      * App.js
   * package.json
   * package-lock.json

Cheers
## [9][In Git, Should i commit any change or just important changes in the project?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hhsqgm/in_git_should_i_commit_any_change_or_just/)

This part about using Git is confusing to me, should i commit every change like adding semicolon, or adding an empty line, or just i should pick only important changes in my code to commit, is there a golden rule??..Thanks in advance!

Yes, if you Google the title of this post you will find a lot of articles and videos on this topic. However, as of today I still haven't found code where a: rootReducer and Store is used.

I want to keep my reducers separate from each other but on the other hand have to possibility to wrap all the components in App.js in a single Provider. Using multiple &lt;XContext.Provider&gt; components looks a bit burdensome to me. I love Redux for the fact that I can pass down the whole store to all App components with &lt;Provider&gt;.

Anyone that has an example?
