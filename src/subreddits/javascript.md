Hey everyone!

I am in the middle of a career change, and picked up programming during the pandemic. I started off by learning Python, followed directly with learning Django. While learning Django, I had a brief stint learning the basics of JS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I am lucky enough to have been asked to interview for an entry-level software development position at a medical software development company (I currently work in Health Info Management). I have 1.5 weeks until my live coding interview (I have passed my preliminary coding interview) and am feeling a bit nervous as it is my first coding interview. The main languages I have been asked to choose from for the interview are JS or PHP. I have never tried PHP and have experience with JS of course, and I have read that logic is similar to Python.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to reach out and see if anyone thought I was still out of my league to be interviewing for this position, and if anyone had any tips, or focal points to study beforehand. I am going to be studying, practicing, and trying my best to become as fluent as possible in this short amount of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, once again, if anyone has any advice, tips, tricks, etc. I would greatly appreciate it.
