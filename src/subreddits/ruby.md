In 2005, DHH showed how to build a blog engine with Ruby on Rails. That demo spurred a movement in web development and changed the industry. Today, I would like to revisit the "Whoops!" video from an opposite approach. While DHH was calling the viewers to "look at all the code I'm not writing", I would like to explore the possibility of writing it all. Yes, let's write S-expressions from the presentation layer down to the SQL one, and contemplate the gains of being forced to understand the stack.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a complete newbie, just following a tutorial and messing around.

On line 15, the code prints out "Th", when I would expect it to print out "T "  
Could you please explain to me why it is printing out "Th", instead of "T " (which would be the 3rd and 2nd position characters?)

Thanks a lot for your help, if there's another subreddit for newbie questions I should be posting this to please let me know / or another forum / etc. for newbie ruby questions that would be highly appreciated.

So, I know the basics of both Rails and Ruby but I am a bit rusty. I've heard good things about pragmatic studio (both ruby and rails course).

However I finished TheOdinProject awhile back (including the Facebook clone, I never went past the rails course fwiw).

Will these courses be too beginner for me? I need to refresh but they are also quite expensive. I am more concerned with the Ruby one than rails since I feel like my Ruby fundamentals is lacking pretty bad (I still understand the basics though)

Hey ruby lovers,  


I'm creating a ruby on rails course but I'm planning to have an api-only backend application in the course. In my last jobs, I used rails application with modern front-end frameworks like react and vue, so I thought it would have also some potential for rails learners to have api-only course but still wanted to get your feedback about it.  


There was another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gi9wcg/im_creating_a_ruby_on_rails_6_course_what_would/) regarding a similar topic but it's difficult to see the demand of an api-only backend application, that's why I wanted to create this one.  


PS: I have been using reddit without pro-actively interacting with the community, it's nice to have a chance to give something back to both reddit &amp; ruby communities with building a free course.
## [7][RSA Blind signature scheme in Ruby](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gp16ma/rsa_blind_signature_scheme_in_ruby/)

Hey, I'm a bit of lost here

Is there a ruby library that implements blind signatures scheme (preferable with RSA)?

I've obviously looked at openssl but the RSA implementation doesn't have (as far as I can tell) blind signing and unblinding methods implemented.

If there is no ruby implementations, what would you suggest to use instead? C library and import that somehow to Ruby?
