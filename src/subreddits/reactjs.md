Hi folks!

We all use web browsers extensively when developing. Aside from using it for the actual development, on average 15% of the whole development time is spent just looking for information on Google. We are building a better solution - a search engine for developers called Grob.

With Grob, you can access codebases, infrastructure, and answers to development questions with a single shortcut.  
Do you also feel that the way developers search could be way faster and be so much more? We just launched our [landing page](https://usegrob.com/) with an early access and any feedback will be really appreciated - we are still trying to identify how exactly developers search and what features to include.

Does your workplace promote TDD? Or do they require unit tests? Integration tests? None at all? Curious to know what other work places are like.
## [6][Performance of expansion panels](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/js5b4c/performance_of_expansion_panels/)

Don't you guys think that [expansion panels](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/expansion-panels.html) are inherently ill-suited for the web considering they always cause layout shifts when expanding/collapsing and so one can't guarantee 60-fps if the page is relatively big?

It doesn't matter how much I optimize any ExapnsionPanel component in React, I almost always see some 55fps or 56fps between the 60-65 fps. Or maybe the whole continuous 60 fps is a bit of a holy grail? Your thoughts?

hey!  
i want to learn modern react - not class based course - but cant find any.  
few days ago i bought Modern React with Redux \[2020 Update\] by Stephen Grider...  
but found out EVERYTHING is class based... he does teach hooks and usecontext.. and then his back to using classes and redux...

im looking for a course that can teach me the basics without classes - or at least not 90% of the course is classes.   
maybe a course that show how it began with classes but moves on to functional programming using hooks.
