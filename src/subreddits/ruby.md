Let's say I have made a player class and I'm trying to make instances of the player class. I do player_1 = Player.new and I get something like &lt;Player:0x00005606f7442a60&gt;
Right now if I say puts "#{player_1 .......}
it will print &lt;Player:0x00005606f7442a60&gt; ......
I want to convert &lt;Player:0x00005606f7442a60&gt; to a name after asking the user for his or her name. Is there a way to make the user see a name instead of the place in memory where it is stored?
