New version of [https://github.com/d2r2/go-rsync](https://github.com/d2r2/go-rsync) released - project which was started as a proof of concept that "Golang can be used  for rich desktop UI development", but eventually led to the creation of  full functional GTK+ app.

What is it that you want to accomplish using this programming language? What is the goal you are working toward using "Go", what do you want to create?

Hello

I have this Java code:

    Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/nopadding"); 
    
    rsaCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, client.getRSAPrivateKey());

This part of code decrypts my message. How can I decrypt this message using Go?

I had tried DecryptOAEP(), privateKet.Decrypt(), DecryptPKCS1v15() and I always got an error: crypto/rsa: decryption error

How do I print out SQL queries for a particular SQLBoiler call instead of the every single SQLBoiler function call? Right now, I set `boil.DebugMode = true`, but this prints out everything.
