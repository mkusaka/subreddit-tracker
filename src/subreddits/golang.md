Hey r/golang , I've been looking at writing an API recently, and I'm wondering what your go to project structure, specifically I've been struggling with a good integration between database and models. I've looked at a whole bunch of articles dating back to 2015, but I'm wondering if there is an overall consensus in the community in 2020 for best practices. Feel free to just drop article or blog links. Thanks all!

Hi guys and gals!

So I’ve been learning go for a while now, and my hope in the future is to score a junior role. I was wondering if anyone had any tips or project ideas for me to create and add to my github to help improve my chances

Thank you!

## [5][Best way to expose/track custom application metrics with metric beat?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/gh1f2a/best_way_to_exposetrack_custom_application/)

I'm looking to define and collect custom application metrics in my Go code. I'll most likely be using metricbeats as my agent. It appears that the standard way to do this is to use the expvar package. I haven't found a lot of links/example online though, wondering if anyone here has a better idea or example repos which do this.

FWIW, my services are all written in Go and run on Kubernetes (EKS) in AWS. I'd like to also collect host, container and cluster level metrics as well. I will also be collecting CloudWatch metrics but I will probably do that outside of my K8s clusters. I'm using Coralogix for my log and metrics backend.

[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) is getting better each day and its Exchange Platform (Beta) offers many handy features that the App does not. If you were to explore, you should surely sign up the app and link you your [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) exchange account (If you do not have it: check for Referral code below).

[Crypto.com Exchange](https://crypto.com/exchange) is a platform you should explore if you are a [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) user. The Web UI is easy to navigate and you have more tools to improve your crypto trading experience even though it is still in Beta. However, you were to check out their [API Official Docs](https://crypto.com/exchange-doc), you might find it rather lacking and not much information were given.

You can check out my examples and wrapper for this. It is in active development and anyone is welcome to contribute.

For Golang: [https://github.com/metarsit/go-crypto-exchange](https://github.com/metarsit/go-crypto-exchange)

If you are new, you can use my referral link [https://platinum.crypto.com/r/2xpsp2nndv](https://platinum.crypto.com/r/2xpsp2nndv)to sign up for [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) and we both get $50 USD.

I was playing around recently with an idea to use git history to try to determine "experts" in a codebase, by subdirectory or file type, etc. and one of the "subproblems" of that project was a little package for parsing git log output: https://github.com/augmentable-dev/gitpert/tree/master/pkg/gitlog and I thought it might be worth sharing here in case folks are interested or have feedback! Perhaps there's a better approach?

thanks!

Hey all! I recently started Twitch streaming at https://twitch.tv/mdlayher and figured some folks here might be interested.

On stream, I'm working a project called CoreRAD (https://github.com/mdlayher/corerad) which is my take on a modernized IPv6 router advertisement daemon, and radvd alternative. If you want to know more, check out: https://mdlayher.com/blog/corerad-a-new-ipv6-router-advertisement-daemon/

I'll be live in about 1 hour at 1pm US Eastern on Saturday, May 9! I would love to see some of you there, and I welcome chat participation, questions, and code review! Thanks for your time!
