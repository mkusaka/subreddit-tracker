Hi all, I would like to show you guys a Ruby debugger, named Ruby  Jard, that I'm working on recently. Ruby Jard provides a rich Terminal  UI that visualizes everything your need, navigates your program with  pleasure, stops at matter places only, reduces manual and mental  efforts. You can now focus on real debugging.

Ruby Jard wraps around Byebug, and Pry and provides a series of features and enhancements. Some significant features:

* Rich intuitive Terminal UI, runs directly in terminal emulators.
* Navigate with pleasure. No more next, next, next, next, and have no idea what you are doing.
* Debug filter. Prevent your program from stepping into weird places.  You can specify which layer (application only, gems, standard libs,  etc.) you are interested in, and can combine with the included/excluded  list.
* Visualize everything you need, grab important things at one glance. A  totally new variable inspection that helps you comprehend any variable  data shape, and peek at its data.
* Powerful REPL console
* Flexible customization

It is still in Beta version. So, it would be great to hear the feedback so that I can improve it in the future.

You can see it in action at [https://rubyjard.org/](https://rubyjard.org/). Or watch the following video: [https://asciinema.org/a/358874](https://asciinema.org/a/358874).
