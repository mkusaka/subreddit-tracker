This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hello, I have some apps on the play store. I often receive emails from people saying they are interested in buying the app. Is it scam ? what about [flippa.com](https://flippa.com) ? How can they make money by buying apps ? Here is the mail I got today :  

```

## [7][Android 11: accessing the microphone from a foreground Service started from the background](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jss2fb/android_11_accessing_the_microphone_from_a/)

The official docs state this:

# While-in-use restrictions

On Android 11 (API level 30) and higher, if your app starts a foreground service while [running in the background](https://developer.android.com/guide/background#definition), the service has the following access restrictions:

* Unless the user has granted the [ACCESS\_BACKGROUND\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) permission to your app, the service cannot access location.
* **The service cannot access the microphone or camera.**

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to overcome this restriction (accessing the microphone from a foreground Service started from the background)? Of course with the necessary user permissions?

I think this is a very penalizing restriction that limits developers' options.

I don't like Google's recent Android development at all! They are copying the worst from iOS and limiting all possibilities!

I just updated Android Studio to version 4.1.1 and my editor lagging issue is gone.

My issue was that when I typed in a new "if..." clause in my Java code, then the editor has been lagging for up to 30 seconds. This is gone now.

I am so thankful, because now I can work like normal again.
