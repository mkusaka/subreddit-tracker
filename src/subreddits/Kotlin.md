I am facing an issue and i need an opinion. I know at least 3 ways to solve the problem but i want to know witch is the best approach. Lets say that i want to add an item to a cart, and notify the user with a corresponidng message: if item exists in card toast "Item already in cart" and if not: "Item added successfully". Adding an item with 2 queries (one to check if exists and one to add the item) seems like a heavy operation. Another way is to store a list of values in the viewmodel and check if item exists in that list. Any advice?

Hello,

I’m developing an android app and was wondering what are some good unit test programs that I can use to test my app with. I’m not sure if there’s any specific kotlin one’s but please let me know.

I am looking to start android development.
I've heard that Google is cancelling javascript. So is Kotlinscript the best option? Also if it helps I am a bootcamp javascript graduate so I know javascript better.

I want to use the Spring framework for making a website, but I still want to stick to Kotlin JVM as much as possible as I prefer it to Java. Has anyone tried using these frameworks in Kotlin? How easy is it to program in and is the configuration suitable for production websites? How does it compare to a pure Kotlin web framework like Ktor?

I did seem to find quite a bit of information about it based on a preliminary search, but is there enough documentation for someone with no experience with Spring to figure it out?

Hi all, I’ve just published the first full version Gryphon, a program that translates Swift code into Kotlin code. It is meant to let developers share their iOS app's code with Android.

I encourage anyone interested to [check out the video](https://twitter.com/gryphonblog/status/1263233844519620610?s=20) and [the website](https://vinivendra.github.io/Gryphon/index.html).

This is the first version where all features are working:

* The generated Kotlin code works the same as the Swift code it came from, no edits needed. There’s an automated test that makes Gryphon translate its own source code, with around 12k lines, and ensures the translation passes all the same tests as the original executable.
* There’s a templates system that’s used to automatically translate many standard library types and methods.
* Xcode integration, with Xcode showing any warnings or errors raised by the Kotlin compiler next to the Swift lines that originated them, so users can fix them at the source.
* The output code is readable, which is useful for minimizing the risks for new users. If Gryphon isn’t the right fit for them, they’re left with a Kotlin codebase they can keep maintaining.

This list of features isn’t to say [there aren’t any bugs](https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon/issues), of course - I’m doing my best to keep track of them and fix them on a daily basis.

Any questions, comments, or feedback in general is welcome!

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

When I upload an image from my gallery into my kotlin app, the orientation of the image is always rotated to the side. How can I rotate them so that they're straight.

I don't know Java

  


I started learning Android development some months ago, and I don't know Java, so I went straight to Kotlin. The problem is, everytime a problem comes up, I look for a solution on Stack Overflow and there it is, a solution in Java. So I try to apply it, and sometimes it works, but when it don't I have to make a new question on Stack Overflow, and mostly they mark my post as duplicate and send me to other solution... In Java.
