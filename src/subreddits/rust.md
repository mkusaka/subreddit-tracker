Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f8ney8/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

So I've only been programming for about 3 years or so. Predominately in Python.  I've played with C and C++, Java, javascript, Elixir. So I know how different languages work some.  Rust looks pretty cool, but I honestly can't come up with a reason to know it.  I am a very project based learner. So having something interesting helps.  Being a new language an all, could anyone suggest some projects to start with Rust? I can't really figure out why I need web assembly at this time. Soooo. any suggestions or reason why to learn Rust are welcome.

There's a lot of benefits to understanding the dependency tree of your favorite packages.  It can also be especially impressive to see useful packages that are self contained with no dependencies.  What are some impressive no (or very little) dependency packages?

Hello,

I was looking at this post [https://turreta.com/2020/02/29/actix-web-with-mysql-using-r2d2-for-connection-pool/](https://turreta.com/2020/02/29/actix-web-with-mysql-using-r2d2-for-connection-pool/) and wondered if the way the codes create and maintain R2D2 Pool is appropriate? Why not create the pool inside the main function?

Cheers!
