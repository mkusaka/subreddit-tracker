This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

For multiple reasons, I have recently been wanting to change jobs. I have been doing Android dev since now about 6 years. I don't have an engineering background, I have a masters in Statistics, and I don't have any education at all in computer science, I am self-learned. I do not lie about this in my CV.  
Recently I have had many online interviews for Android developer jobs with the same scenario: they bring up the online coding thing and I am asked to solve some algo problem such as reversing a binary tree (for the easiest), or optimising the complexity of an existing algorithm. at the same time, I am not asked a single question on Android at all. I understand that these companies want some high-level engineering people, but why put through all the recruiting process with someone for an Android dev job if they are clearly looking for engineers? I admit, I am not an engineer, my solving problems skills have some limits (which can probably be compensated with a google search) but I still have a scientific approach and tend to always look for optimal solutions to a problem. nevertheless, these companies will probably end up recruiting a very talented person who might not know much on android development rather than a great android developer which will deliver a top quality app in little time.  
let me guys know what you think about this.

Hi, I'm learning Android Room library and I found @Update annotation in DAO class. Here's the method:

@Update
void updateUser(User user);

How is it going to update your table? We don't have WHERE clause. Should I use the same User object that I used during inserting to have the same id?
## [8][Anyone received reviews like these that says the game/app is nice but vote 1 star? I'm just curious, are they bots or are they just being sarcastic?

I have an optimus laptop (hybrid graphics) with 8GB of RAM running Fedora. I want to run emulator using hardware acceleration since I have limited RAM. If I am to run emulator  with iGPU whole machine becomes slow since

Android Studio Java VM instance (\~2.0) + Gradle daemons (\~.92 GB) + emulator (\~2.1) &gt;= 5 GB approximately.

In order to make things worse overtime AGP seems to be spawning new gradle daemons which was reported [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/138908544), and overtime AS JVM instance also seems to getting bigger.

When machine is low on RAM it turns to swap which makes things slow and finally totally freezing, so I have to hit power button. Having to make change and waiting to see the result and your machine freeze. This makes Android dev totally unhappy experience. In order to do work for a while have to keep eye on the gradle daemons and kill unused ones manually or restart android studio time to time.

Devs do not have phones from each API version so they have to rely to emulators for testing sometimes.

I have enabled KVM, Virtualization, Emulator settings set to hardware acceleration. Still emulator takes about 2 GB and start to make things slow.

&amp;#x200B;

* Was anyone able to use dGPU with emulator on Linux? 
* Am I the only one having hard time with emulators and Android Studio? What is the case in Window and MacOS?
* It seems to be you need at least 16 GB RAM to do Android Dev comfortably? May be need at least 16 cores?

Hi

I am trying to develop a mobile application that uses camera to detect objects and give warnings to prevent collisions.

Could you guys please suggest  me what platform I could use for developing the mobile application? I was thinking of using Flutter.

Additionally, if there are any tips or suggestions - I am open to those.

According to

*  [https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/dokbtl/in\_app\_billing\_a\_lot\_of\_weird\_refunds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/dokbtl/in_app_billing_a_lot_of_weird_refunds/) 
*  [https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/bsgfx6/play\_store\_automatic\_refunds\_after\_72\_hours/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/bsgfx6/play_store_automatic_refunds_after_72_hours/) 
*  [https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f8x9ss/inapp\_purchases\_always\_get\_refunded\_after\_3\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f8x9ss/inapp_purchases_always_get_refunded_after_3_days/) 

We need to acknowledge a success purchase.

But, what if the acknowledgement failed? Should we retry the acknowledgement? But how? Should we still allow user to access the in-app purchase item?

Thanks.
