**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

## [3][New library: Font Chef](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlvmqf/new_library_font_chef/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlvmqf/new_library_font_chef/

Hey all!

I'm releasing a new library, called Font Chef, to assist in text rendering. Its purpose is to create an atlas of selected glyphs from unicode blocks and produce source and target rectangles to clip and render the atlas into the screen. It is basically an abstraction of the great [stb\_truetype](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h)

It handles kerning, wrapping (line breaking) and alignment. It is also fully documented with examples and a manual.

Example for C:

    fc_font * font = fc_construct(font_data, fc_px(30), fc_color_black);
    fc_add(fc_basic_latin.start, fc_basic_latin.end);
    fc_cook(font);
    // use fc_get_pixels(font) to make a texture
        
    const char hello[] = "Hello, world!";
    fc_character_mapping output[32];
    int count = fc_render(font, text, strlen(hello), &amp;output);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
        render(texture, output[i].source, output[i].target
    }

It comes with a C++ wrapper. Example for C++:

    fc::font font = fc
          ::from(font_data, fc::px(30), fc_color_black)
          .add(fc_basic_latin)
          .cook();
    
    // use font.pixels() to make a texture
    
    fc::render_result result = font.render("Hello, world!");
    for (auto &amp; map : result) {
        render(texture, map.source, map.target);
    }

I believe this is mostly useful to those handling directly with graphics rendering (aka game developers with their own engine) but I hope it is useful to you if you're not in that group.

Opinions and constructive criticism are very much welcome.

After some initial struggle ( [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62692631/reflection-using-structured-bindings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62692631/reflection-using-structured-bindings)) where I was also suggested "magic get" (but that seemed like a complicated library), I ended up with this piece of code, that allows you to transform a POD into a std::tuple using C++17's structured-bindings:

    template&lt;std::size_t N, typename T, typename = void&gt;
    struct bind
    	: std::integral_constant&lt;std::size_t, 0U&gt;
    {};
    
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    struct bind&lt;1U, T, std::void_t&lt;decltype(T{ {} })&gt;&gt;

    {};
    
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    struct bind&lt;2U, T, std::void_t&lt;decltype(T{ {}, {} })&gt;&gt;

    {};
    
    template&lt;typename T&gt;

    {};

    		return std::make_tuple();
    	};
    
    	using type = decltype(make(std::declval&lt;T&gt;()));
    };
    
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    struct to_tuple&lt;1U, T&gt; {
    	static constexpr auto make = [](auto&amp;&amp; x) noexcept {
    		auto [_1] = x;
    		return std::make_tuple(_1);
    	};
    
    	using type = decltype(make(std::declval&lt;T&gt;()));
    };

    	};
    
    	using type = decltype(make(std::declval&lt;T&gt;()));
    };

    struct to_tuple&lt;3U, T&gt; {

    		auto [_1, _2, _3] = x;
    		return std::make_tuple(_1, _2, _3);
    	};
    
    	using type = decltype(make(std::declval&lt;T&gt;()));
    };
    
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    static constexpr auto max_bind = std::max({ bind_v&lt;0U, T&gt;, bind_v&lt;1U, T&gt;, bind_v&lt;2U, T&gt;, bind_v&lt;3U, T&gt; });

Hi,

I Just started learning C++ for UE 4 game development, still learning basic syntax, I'm just curious, why everyone says C++ is difficult comparing to other languages.

I'm still a beginner and I didn't start learning deep concepts

thanks.
## [9][Is there a standard way to convert between string, wstring, and the unicode strings?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlpdec/is_there_a_standard_way_to_convert_between_string/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlpdec/is_there_a_standard_way_to_convert_between_string/
---
I'm looking for a standard way to convert between string, wstring, and the unicode strings. I have code to convert the unicode strings between each other (ie. utf8 -&gt; utf16, utf8 -&gt; utf32, etc...) which is straightforward as they don't depend on the compiler, platform, etc... What I need is to convert string to wstring, wstring to string, and both to any (or all) of the unicode strings.

Up till now I've been using MultiByteToWideChar() and WideCharToMultiByte() with the code page set to either CP\_ACP or CP\_UTF8 as necessary. Of course this is windows only and I'd like to move to a platform agnostic method.

I looked at codecvt (in &lt;locale&gt;), which seems designed for this purpose, but it as I understand it will be deprecated ([http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0618r0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0618r0)) and is unsafe. &lt;cuchar&gt; also has a set of conversion functions (mbrtoc16, c16rtomb, etc...) but I'm unsure exactly what they are converting from/to. I don't know what a 'narrow multibyte character representation' is, or how that relates to strings, wstrings, etc...

I'm not looking for a dumb static\_cast, I want to properly convert the code points, when possible.
## [10][How effective is using c++17 extract and insert move on ordered maps for minimizing memory fragmentation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlwx2g/how_effective_is_using_c17_extract_and_insert/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hlwx2g/how_effective_is_using_c17_extract_and_insert/
---
I assume if a program requires many erases and insertions in an ordered map, but keeps the same size, then the memory storing the map's nodes will not be recycled but rather point to new address in memory, thus creating fragmented memory.

If this assumption is true, then I ask can the use of c++17 extract and insert move be used to recycle the  memory that contains existing nodes in order to minimize memory fragmentation?

Is it possible that a pool allocator would have already have taken care of this problem?

“Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out”

Bjarne Stroustrup

We all know that c++ is about strong backward compatibility. The only way of fixing an unsound language feature is to add a new feature along with the old one.

I just want to discuss here about a way to restrict language features to get “smaller and cleaner language” inside particular project code base. 

*Is it possible to have static analysis tools that preprocess the code and forbid compilation with undesired old features?*

Not full list of undesired features, but just for example: implicit conversions, C-style casts, avoid some initialization rules, .. (for sure you can continue the list)

What do you think? Does someone have particular experience with that?
