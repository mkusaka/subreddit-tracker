**The word-selecting function on Google Translate mobile**

Google Translate mobile has a function that we can scan a document then all the bounding boxes of words will be displayed to the screen, then the user can use swipe gestures to select the words that he wants to translate.

Demo function

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a0kp5o0xca051.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d257f41e556cd0987d9fb0d452ce72ee367f6f05

I tried to figure out and reproduce the idea behind it with HTML/JS. Although they made it so smoothly even on a low-performance device, my code seems to have problems with performance.

**What I have tried**

1. Fire an event on every move of user touch -&gt; Requires looping over the bounding boxes list to check
2. Use Drag/Drop event of HTML -&gt; To many event listeners could also cause performance issue

Could anyone have any idea about that function?
