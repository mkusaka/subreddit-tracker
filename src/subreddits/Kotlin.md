[Doodle](https://github.com/nacular/doodle) is a pure Kotlin UI framework for the Web, that lets you create rich applications without relying on Javascript, HTML or CSS. Check out the [documentation](https://nacular.github.io/doodle) to learn more.

This release fixes some minor bugs, while adding new documentation for [drag-and-drop](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/#/dragdrop). Doodle has very customizable support for data transfer, including drag-and-drop for files, which was added in version 0.3.0.

Feedback is always appreciated.

Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very tired of writing, again and again, the same rest requests and some associated logic (mappers from on kind of object received from the server with the rest-client, to another kind of object used in the apps) for my android and iOS apps. 

As you can imagine, I have to maintain the data classes that act as transporters in Android, and in Swift. Then the rest requests with retrofit, and with Alamofire. I can't wait for the moment where I move all this logic to a shared project in Kotlin Native.

&amp;#x200B;

I already have a shared code module for this project, where I have some easy classes that are shared by both apps (some easy logic that is platform-independent and things like that). But I'm unable to get the tutorials and samples related to ktor that I found on the internet to work. The problem starts normally with the contents of the build.grade file of the sample projects. All the samples are so different from my build.gradle file, that I'm not able to include the dependencies for ktor.

I already tried with this sample project ([https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples/tree/master/client-mpp](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples/tree/master/client-mpp)) without success.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it is my fault and I have to start again...
