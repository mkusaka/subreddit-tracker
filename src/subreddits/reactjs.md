Hello there, I have a really bad problem with redux form atm.  
I have a normal form with checkboxes and selects and then inside the same form, I have a react-table 6 with 2 - 3 levels of subcomponents including redux form fields. Each field is created with Field component.

The problem is, updating some of the form fields several times causes re-mounting of the whole form, then, eventually, it begins to act normal.

Has anybody ever encountered such a problem ?
