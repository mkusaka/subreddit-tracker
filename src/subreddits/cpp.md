**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

There are a lot of declarative GUI frameworks (or libraries) in different languages. The difference with the imperative approach is that you tell the framework *what* and now *how*, it's explained for example [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/declarative).

In C++, there's QML. However declarative framework doesn't exactly mean a markup language, UI can be declaratively built in code as well, like it's done in [Elements](https://github.com/cycfi/elements/blob/master/examples/buttons/main.cpp#L64) project.

Is there anything else built on top of, for example, wxWidgets and other existing libraries?

A programmer got up one day and thought to himself "I'm going to create something so bad, it will piss off everyone that has to touch it". This project was a cruel inside joke of a group of friends that hung around on IRC. They figured that if you create something over-engineered, badly designed, and uses pretty colors at the stdout, people will use it. You can even get funded by some government entity if you present your project with a nice powerpoint presentation.

Fast-forward 20 years, and we're stuck with CMake. The joke became reality, and countless hours of high salary office workers have been wasted attempting to debug arcane messages, behavior, and a DSL that was designed in the darkest corners of hell.

Now don't tell me CMake was not a joke. It is simply not possible for someone, or a group of people, to create such an abomination. They would have set fire to every physical copy of CMake known to mankind early in it's development after realizing it's horrible nature. Myth has it that if you use CMake, you must find another person within a week and get them to integrate CMake else you die in highly suspicious circumstances. Did you know that CMake is causing global warming due to the countless CPU cycles wasted trying to compile from source? Oh, the pure insanity that is the documentation. You want to compile a program? Take my advice, type those `g++` and `ld` commands by hand - doesn't matter how big your project is. Anything that avoids using CMake is a win in my book. 

Know that some people, somewhere, are having the time of their lifes, rolling around in stacks of money earned through billed CMake consultancy hours, books, and conference talks.

## [11][In need of a console / reverse terminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hgxq96/in_need_of_a_console_reverse_terminal/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hgxq96/in_need_of_a_console_reverse_terminal/
---
## The problem
I have bunch of apps (mostly games) running on Windows/Mac/iOS/Android. They print/log stuff on terminals. On Android I got logcat. On Windows I can print in DevStudio debugger output or create an ugly terminal window and print there. On iOS I can see things in Xcode. None of these are convenient enough.

## What I would like to have
Some unified console in one place accepting connections over tcp and printing everything it receives. So no matter where I run the app everything will be displayed in one window on one machine. Preferably this console would support tabs, filtering, VT terminal colors, "exporting" to some HTML, timing, etc.

## What I have
I have some very simple logger which can connect to tcp and send stuff there. It can also redirect `stdout` there. I can also use `spdlog`. I can adopt their `tcp sink`:

&lt;https://github.com/gabime/spdlog&gt;

## What is missing
The actual console application. Kind of like a reverse terminal which just accepts the connections and displays everything it receives. Does anybody know of anything like that is already available? I can probably carve up one rather quick around QTcpServer. I just don't want to reinvent the wheel if something like that already exists.
## [12][Intel vs ARM memory model](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hggkpw/intel_vs_arm_memory_model/)

The x86 has strong memory model. But what about ARM?

With the Apple switch, I am wondering if code that uses C++ std::atomics, and that runs bug-free with Intel CPUs,
could in fact reveal bugs when compiled for ARM (in case ARM has a weaker memory model).
I am not speaking about compiler bugs of course, but about wrong use of std::atomics that are "hidden" when used on Intel CPUs.
