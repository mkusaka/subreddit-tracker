* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I already know java and I have been using it for years. When Kotlin was announced I had mix feelings about it on a personal level, I have been planning to learn native Android development since I already know Java but because of Kotlin now I am undecided. I don't want to learn something that will probably get replaced in a year or two, and I think Kotlin has a 50/50 chance of succeeding.

So is java gonna get replaced, if yes how long would it take? and how about the future of Kotlin? should I just go web?

I am planning to integrate the use of "coins" to activate some features in my (first) app. The base price will be 1 coin and it will have a relate manage product in the play store.

Also I want to put packs of 5, 10 and 50 coins. After reading the documentation I am not sure how should I proceed in this scenario.

* User wants to use FeatureX.
* FeatureX costs 1 coin.
* User buys 5 coins pack (let's say SKU 0002).
* User wants to use **ONE** of the **5** coins available.
* &amp;#x200B;

What should I do here? Do I consume the SKU 0002 ? Do I keep track of the internal purchased items until the 5 coins are all used and then send I a \`consume\` request? Is there a way to map a 5 coins pack to "buy 5 times the 1 coin product"?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help will be appreciated :)

As part of my work I've discovered during past 2 years four different Android phones that have a critical vulnerability in their keystore implementations.

Basically whenever such a device creates an RSA keypair, the key is always the same across ALL devices. All findings were reported to the device manufacturers, 2 of them patched the issue, 2 have not responded.

How is this even possible? Shouldn't Google compatibility test suite cover this sort of thing? Quite easy to test, create two keypairs and make sure they're not the same. It's not like the phones are from unknown companies (Nokia for example, luckily they fixed quite rapidly).

Not sure how to proceed with the 2 manufacturers who have not acted upon the issue.

Hi,
I did the thing and clicked some live ads because of curiosity and they were showing ads I was actually interested in... And my account is "limited"
I accept its my fault, but according to their documentation house ads and mediation are not affected by the limits.
I created a house ad and also added AdColony to the mediation. However, all I get is a blank area at the bottom of my app. I set the eCPMs so that the AdColony entry was above the Admob entry in the mediation group. 
I also have an iOS app that I did the same with and I get a blur AdColony banner there.
Any suggestions on what else I need to look into in order to try and get something working?

I am working on an app which needs to store intermediate information from the user or of the user in shared preferences. So what is a secure method to store that information in share preferences. Encrypting is an option but I am concerned whether the app will slow down if I try to decrypt the share preferences and then sending that information to the cloud.
Thank you
