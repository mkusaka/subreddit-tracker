I'm currently putting together a post about how the [Action Dispatch Request object](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/1ef8c60dfcab2f0594b468088680fe1054d17452/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb) works under the hood. Is there any part of Rails you wished you understood better? I'd be happy to write about it.

Fortunately I've completed the Hartl Tutorial, and done at least 1/2 of the Rails lessons on Odin project, and may try out App Open Academy (free).  Wondering if anyone has used their material, and thoughts if so.

I am in the middle of a Rails tutorial and I am completely stuck.

I was hoping I could get some help on here from some seasoned RoR individuals.

I am trying to create a table for messages from users. I am trying to create a message in the rails console to see if my table works but it won't let me create it.

I keep receiving an error that says "ActiveModel::UnknownAttributeError (unknown attribute 'body' for Message.)"

Thanks in advance

Hello kind people. I’m not sure whether it’s the right place to post this. So, I’m 20 y.o., doing RoR for little less than a year now on a commercial basis and around 3 years in total. Anyway, I have been looking for a job for a long time now and people just don’t care about juniors or RoR developers in general, or is it just me?... some people say at 20 you should be a middle-senior already, some say you better finish university and only than look for smth. What do you think? When did you start? Did you find the job easily? Do you have any advise?

Hello there...

I need some advice if you don't mind.

I have a service I have created as a backend only in rails with actioncable and multischema (tenant) postgres db.

I'm hating having to deal with CORS and extra security and running two services.

Would it be bad/not scalable to have it as a monolith?

Pros? Cons? 

I will be deploying this to ECS in AWS if that helps...

Please and thank you all for your help.

I want to generate short, unique, non-sequential ids to help obfuscate my model records. I wasn't able to get [hashid-rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/hashid-rails) to work, so I decided to roll my own solution using [SecureRandom](https://ruby-doc.com/stdlib-2.5.2/libdoc/securerandom/rdoc/SecureRandom.html#module-SecureRandom-label-Examples) and [friendly_id](https://rubygems.org/gems/friendly_id).

I just want to make sure that my solution is performant and acceptable.

```
class Note &lt; ApplicationRecord
  extend FriendlyId
  friendly_id :hashid, use: :slugged

  before_create :set_hashid

  private
    def set_hashid
      self.hashid = SecureRandom.hex(5)
    end

end
```

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ffev1f/help_with_associations/
---
I'm building an application which consists on two modesl: `Task` and `Project`. Projects may have several zero or more tasks (`has_many` association), but tasks don't necessarily belong to a project. Well, I don't know how to program that last part in terms of routing, because if I implement this:

    Rails.application.routes.draw do
        resources :tasks
        resources :projects do
            resources :tasks
        end
    end

Rails assigns the same `Controller#Action` to both tasks, so I don't know how to distinguish between them:

    Controller#Action    Prefix            Verb   URI Pattern
    
    tasks#index          tasks             GET    /tasks(.:format)
    tasks#create                           POST   /tasks(.:format)
    
    tasks#index          project_tasks     GET    /projects/:project_id/tasks(.:format)
    tasks#create                           POST   /projects/:project_id/tasks(.:format)

Is there any way to separate them? Maybe creating different actions?

Hi guys,

I am working on my final for my Ruby class(Ruby II not rails). I have an array that I have created from reading in a file. I am creating a word search puzzle. I need to list the words under my word search grid. I have 45 words and want 3 rows of 15 words each. I am also using a Prawn to create a pdf file to output my word search grid, words, and a grid key. Any advice on the best way to split my array into 3 equal columns to print out my words?

I was thinking about creating some kind of method that would calculate the length, the take that length and divide it by 3. From there I would print a string with one column ljust, one column centered, and one column rjust.

The other option I am entertaining is to create a boundary with the prawn and somehow break the list into 3 parts and put each part in the created boundary.

Any ideas and direction here would be greatly appreciated.

Here is my method to create my array (I have to put a space after my instance variable so it would allow me to include it on this post)

@ words = \[\]  
*file* = File.open(*file*)  
until *file*.eof?  
*word* = *file*.gets.chomp  
@ words&lt;&lt; *word*.delete(" ")  
@ words = @ words.sort\_by{ |*x*|-*x*.length }

end  
*file*.close

My list of words I am including

Apple  
Apricot  
Avocado  
Breadfruit  
Banana  
Blackberry  
Blackcurrant  
Blueberry  
Cherimoya  
Cherry  
Clementine  
Coconut  
Cranberry  
Custard Apple  
Durian  
Fig  
Grapefruit  
Grape  
Guava  
Jackfruit  
Kiwi  
Lemon  
Lime  
Loganberry  
Mandarin  
Mango  
Mangosteen  
Melon  
Nectarine  
Orange  
Papaya  
Peach  
Pear  
Persimmon  
Pineapple  
Plum  
Pomegranate  
Quince  
Satsuma  
Sharon  
Strawberry  
Tamarillo  
Tangerine  
Ugli  
Watermelon

My prawn pdf creation

def create\_pdf  
Prawn::Document.generate('puzzle2.pdf') do |*pdf*|  
*pdf*.font 'Courier', size: 20  
*pdf*.text 'Word Search', align: :center  
*pdf*.font 'Courier', size: 8  
*pdf*.move\_down(80)

*pdf*.text(print\_puzzle, align: :center)  
*pdf*.start\_new\_page  
*pdf*.text(print\_puzzle, align: :center)  
end

In Minitest I can use the `def setup` method to initialize some values before each test is run. My setup looks like this. 

    def setup 
    find_agent
    create_session
    end

I would want to modify the setup method to take a different agent from the `find_agent` method based on which test is running. Is there a way I can decorate each test so that the common setup method picks the right type of agent based on the test and creates a session?
## [12][Handling transactions with update_attributes!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ffi1b0/handling_transactions_with_update_attributes/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ffi1b0/handling_transactions_with_update_attributes/

I have a two below method that I want to wrap around a transaction so if update\_model fails destroy\_roles will be rolled back

    def update_model 
      if model.update_attributes(params)
         #do something
      else
         render /errors
      end
    end
    
    def destroy_roles
        role.destroy
    end

If I wanted to achieve the below using a transaction. 

    object.transaction do 
        destroy_roles
        update_model
    end
    
    def update_model
      begin
        model.udpate_attributes!(params
      resuce =&gt; e
        generate_bad_request(model.errors)
    end

Here is what I'm assuming will happen, 

1)  `destroy_roles` will destroy the roles of that particular model, in `update_model` the `update_attributes` raises an exception and we'll generate a bad request back for the user and also since it is inside a transaction the destroyed users in destroy\_roles will be restored as well. 

Could you please help me if my understanding is correct, I'm confused since we have handled the exception whether the transaction will roll back the destroy\_roles or do I have to re-raise the exception and so on.   


Any links to tutorial/documentation for the same would be really helpful as well.
