To your surprise, there is a place in the world that does not have access to high-speed internet. Indian Occupied Kashmir. Which is why I am not able to download the dependencies from the terminal. It just shows error. Is there any other way I can download the files from Chrome or something? I am trying to download and install 'react-router-dom'. Kindly help!

 In this article I‚Äôm going to present to you a way of handling your API errors once and for all in a centralized and easily extendable way, regardless of the state-management library (Redux, Apollo, etc.) that you are using.

I deployed a react website(using create-react-app), on netlify. The Lighthouse audit was decent, the Performance section would be around 80%.  Then I included a library [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap), because it pre-renders my web app into static HTML, and does other load performance optimization. So I expected the Performance score to increase, because it should reduce page load. 

However this lowered my score on [Lighthouse to 63%](https://i.imgur.com/gGozKNh.png). This is because react-snap has issues with code splitting when using React.lazy, but I [followed their directions on the workaround](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap#async-components) and  has made little to no difference on improving the score.

prerenderComponent.tsx

    import { PrerenderedComponent } from "react-prerendered-component";
    
    // Solution 1
    export const prerenderedLoadable = (dynamicImport: any) =&gt; {
      const LoadableComponent = loadable(dynamicImport);
      return React.memo((props) =&gt; (
        // you can use the `.preload()` method from react-loadable or react-imported-component`
        &lt;PrerenderedComponent live={LoadableComponent.load()}&gt;
          &lt;LoadableComponent {...props} /&gt;
        &lt;/PrerenderedComponent&gt;
      ));
    };
    
    // Solution 2
    const prefetchMap = new WeakMap();
    const prefetchLazy = (LazyComponent: any) =&gt; {
      if (!prefetchMap.has(LazyComponent)) {
        prefetchMap.set(LazyComponent, LazyComponent._ctor());
      }
      return prefetchMap.get(LazyComponent);
    };
    
    export const prerenderedLazy = (dynamicImport: any) =&gt; {
      const LazyComponent = React.lazy(dynamicImport);
      return React.memo((props) =&gt; (
        &lt;PrerenderedComponent live={prefetchLazy(LazyComponent)}&gt;
          &lt;LazyComponent {...props} /&gt;
        &lt;/PrerenderedComponent&gt;
      ));
    };
    

Graph.tsx

    import React, { Suspense } from "react";
    import { prerenderedLoadable, prerenderedLazy } from "./prerenderedComponent";
    
    // Solution 1
    // const FusionTimeChart = prerenderedLoadable(() =&gt;
    //   import("./Fusion/FusionTimeChart")
    // );
    // Solution 2
    // const FusionTimeChart = prerenderedLazy(() =&gt;
    //   import("./Fusion/FusionTimeChart")
    // );
    
    export default function Graph() {
      return (
        &lt;section className="coding-activity"&gt;
          &lt;h2 className="section-title coding-activity-title"&gt;
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
          &lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(Powered by wakatime.com)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div className="container"&gt;
            {/*
            Solution 1
              &lt;FusionTimeChart /&gt;
            */}
            {/*
            Solution 2
             &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
              &lt;FusionTimeChart /&gt;
            &lt;/Suspense&gt; 
            */}
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
      );
    }

## [10][Handeling consistent state over multiple modules](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gya7yn/handeling_consistent_state_over_multiple_modules/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gya7yn/handeling_consistent_state_over_multiple_modules/

I'm wondering what peoples experiences are in regards to handeling consistent state in multiple modules in a react application. Let's assume you have multiple redux stores, one for each module in a project, and sometimes data in one store could affect data in another store. To be more specific you might have table showing data which you can also edit. This data is in 1. redux store. But if you edit this data, and go to another table in the system, which gets data from a 2. Redux store, the data has not been updated even though the edit you made on the first table should have affected the data in the second table. This requires that the user have to press refresh to see the changes take effect, which is not ideal. Or would you even use redux for this matter? - I have been looking at graphQL and apollo as well, since eventually realtime updates will become necessary as well, as in multible users should be able to interact with the system at the same time. First time posting here, so let me know if more info is needed, but in general i'm just interested in getting some different ideas/views on people would normally handle this in a large scale react project.
