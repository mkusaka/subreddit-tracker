We are in the process of breaking up our Rails monolith into microservices and moving from REST to GraphQL. Has anyone been through a process like this before that could offer me some advice? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent a good amount of time reading through [https://graphql-ruby.org/](https://graphql-ruby.org/) but I still have somewhat general questions that I am struggling to find answers to. For example, how would I restrict certain fields from being discoverable/queriable based on the role of a user? I am mainly just hoping someone can point me in the direction of some good resources to help prepare me for this transition.

I've seen a lot of people suggest you dive into projects/building stuff if you *really* want to learn programming. To my understanding, codewars is just that, you build stuff and compete with others to see who did it best. I can't decide between codecademy or odinproject or whether I can use them both, although I don't want to waste time where it isn't needed. I learn lightning fast when I learn hands on. So at what point can I just put down the basics (strings, objects, vectors etc) and pick up ruby code as needed? What would you do?

 Why is this returning true, false, true, truedef is\_valid\_name(str)  
 names = str.split(" ")  
  valid = \[\]  
  if names.length &lt; 2  
return "false"  
  end  
names.each do |name\_part|  
if name\_part\[0\].upcase  
return "true"  
elsif name\_part\[1..-1\].upcase  
return "false"      end    endend  
puts is\_valid\_name("Kush Patel")       # =&gt; true  
puts is\_valid\_name("Daniel")           # =&gt; false  
puts is\_valid\_name("Robert Downey Jr") # =&gt; true  
puts is\_valid\_name("ROBERT DOWNEY JR") # =&gt; false

You know Big-O is important - not only for acing your next job interview but for knowing how code works at scale. But have you ever taken the time to go beyond a superficial understanding of the subject? In this article, Julie Kent uses equal parts math and Ruby to reveal the beating heart of Big-O and show us how it ticks.

Sorry I’m a bit embarrassed to ask but I have zero coding experience, I make music and I’m trying to access a file and had no idea where else to ask. 

I think it’s just a few simple lines you need to type that takes a minute but I tried it on my Mac and apparently it doesn’t work on terminal so that’s why I post here. 

Anyway this is what I’m trying to do: https://github.com/kurt-culley/ScrapeTrainV2

If anyone can help, thank you!
