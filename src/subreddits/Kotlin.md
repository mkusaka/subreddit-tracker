I have used [jsonschema2pojo](http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/) for generating Java objects from JSON. Unfortunately, the converter doesn't offer to generate Kotlin objects. Does anyone know a good converter that creates Kotlin objects from JSON?

I'm developing a ktor+kotlin web application and I wanted to know is there a way to implement [turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinkshttps://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) into it. I've looked everywhere but couldn't find an answer.

## [9][Kotlin DSL, Gradle, Docker, Javalin example?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/ika83z/kotlin_dsl_gradle_docker_javalin_example/)

Anyone happen to have an example repo using 
- Gradle + Kotlin DSL (specifically `gradle.build.kts`)
- Javalin
- Docker

... that produces a runnable docker image?

I'm new to the JVM ecosystem (coming from Node/Rust), and this has been surprisingly difficult to get working on my own.

Thanks!

After a number of years of on again and off again study I am finally finishing a Java course.  I read an article that said once you've worked through Java it was best to jump to Kotlin before picking up any bad habits.  I need to make a couple websites so my plan was to start learning Spring Boot.  But then I wondered if it was best to start off with Kotlin and then jump into Spring Boot?
