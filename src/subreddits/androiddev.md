This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?

* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

My app allows users to discover movies / TV shows, watch trailers and more, **but not to watch them**.

This is stated first thing in my app's description and in the first screenshot for each language I support.

&amp;#x200B;

However I am getting 1-star ratings because some people cannot read / want to watch the movies for free.

I reported the reviews in Play Console but removal was rejected. What's strange is that in the past, such reviews were removed after I reported them, but during the pandemic they are not. I don't know if it's about that or something in Google's policy changed.

&amp;#x200B;

[This one even claims that it has viruses. Yeah, right.](https://preview.redd.it/38rym8iw82z41.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce338c2bc3fd7ef35bdaccadaa1e72055176054)

[Even after explaining to them, they don't care to update their review.](https://preview.redd.it/6gn335iw82z41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7bd6205dadd7678597a0ead7143c5adc5ab3c27)

I am working very had to provide a good experience to my users. **Receiving bad ratings about something other than what my app does and Google not removing them is very unfair**.

&amp;#x200B;

I am posting this here for visibility as I am sure more people have the same issues.

PS: I have contacted support about this and I am waiting for their reply.

I'm a hobbyist developer and over the years I have written about 25 apps in Java. From time to time, I think I really should start learning and coding in Kotlin. However I have two things that hold me back. 

The first thing is that when I get an idea for a new app, I get excited and want to get something working asap. Frequently, I find that  \~70% of the new code I can copy/paste/adapt from previous apps I've written in Java. Consequently the urge to just continue in Java is strong.

Secondly, sometimes I want to write a desktop companion for the Android app. I'm not sure how established Kotlin for desktop is, whereas I'm pretty comfortable writing in Java and know it will run on Win/Mac/Linux with no problem.

So every time I think about writing a new app in Kotlin, the above factors push me back to using Java.

Often times this question comes up, "What is the value of doing this?", and sometimes it feels like, "Isn't it obvious?" , And it gets difficult to explain. 
Any suggestions?

Hello there,
What would you recommend to someone coming from Android development and wants to try out the other side?

Can I debug my app on an old iPhone with Xcode as I would with Android USB debugging?

Should I try Kotlin multiplatform at this time or go straight into Swift?

Cheers
## [9][ConstraingLayoug variable aspect ratio of the image view depending on the screen height](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gkt7hs/constrainglayoug_variable_aspect_ratio_of_the/)

Hey, as stated in the title I wan to create a screen with a multi-line text in the top and a couple of buttons in the bottom.  In the middle, there would be an image if there is enough space the image should be aspect ratio 1:1 if not it should fill the space available between the buttons and text view.  


Currently, I just manage to create a view with the static 1:1 aspect ration on smaller devices the buttons get pushed out. Does someone know a solution for this? 

I read about the ratio to be set in a dim folder and use it the XML but I'm not sure if this would cover all the bases if I have two ratios for big and small devices. 

My code:   [https://pastebin.com/hy8fxME9](https://pastebin.com/hy8fxME9) 

Thank you in advance!

Had anybody implemented this? You know you will use this approach when you havr certains screens with appbarlayout and collapsibletoolbar, per google you need to use a toolbar on each fragment im using nav components arc i already tried onnavdestinationchangdlistener from then nav controller setting the visibility on and off of the main toolbar is not good. Any feedback is appreciate it.
## [12][How do you handle file export/import under shared storage (Android 11)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gkrgw1/how_do_you_handle_file_exportimport_under_shared/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gkrgw1/how_do_you_handle_file_exportimport_under_shared/
---
In Android 11, the app doesn't have access to files other than through MediaStore or Storage Access Framework. 

To export a file to a directory on the SD card that is both visible to the user and that can also be imported by the app I assume that you could use Intent.ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT to create an entry in a DocumentsProvider (though this feels like complete overkill).

My question is how can the user manually provide a csv file for import? Whenever the user manually stores a file on the sd card, the file won't be in a MediaStore or DocumentsProvider and therefore cannot be accessed by the app.
