We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

**Let's say I have a context component that sets the isLoggedIn state to true if the server request was successful, and it wraps the App component**

    function Context(){
      const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false)
        useEffect(() =&gt; {
         // server request
        setIsLoggedIn(true) // if successful request
        }, [])
    }

**The App component receives isLoggedIn from context and displays users profile component if the user is logged in and if not it redirects to "/"**
 
    function App() {

      const {isLoggedIn} = useContext(Context)

      return (
        &lt;div&gt;

         &lt;Switch&gt;
           &lt;Route exact path="/profile&gt; {isLoggedIn ? &lt;MyProfile /&gt; : &lt;Redirect to="/" /&gt;} &lt;/Route&gt;
         &lt;/Switch&gt;
        
       &lt;/div&gt;
      )
    }

**However because the server request takes a while it will never display the profile page, how can I make it wait or solve this problem another way?**

I am trying to create a private route which checks user authentication. But the Private route renders before data from redux Is updated. The component has like isauthenticated variable which eventually updates to true but the component renders &lt;Redirect to="/login" /&gt; first before it gets updated.
As the redux has its value as false at 1st render.

            
const PrivateRoute = ({component: Component, isAuthenticated, ...rest}) =&gt;{
    return(
        
        &lt;Route {...rest} render={
            (props) =&gt; {
                if(isAuthenticated) { 
                 return &lt;Component {...props}/&gt;
                }else{
                    return &lt;Redirect to="/login"/&gt;
                }
                
            }
        }/&gt;
    )
}

const mapStateToProps = state =&gt;{
    return{
        isAuthenticated: state.token !== null
    }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, null)(PrivateRoute)

## [12][Displaying embedded html in string with FormattedMessage](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gbh25q/displaying_embedded_html_in_string_with/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gbh25q/displaying_embedded_html_in_string_with/
---
We have recently updated our websites's npm packages (react-intl version 4.5.1). The problem is, that we used FormattedHTMLMessage to display embedded html in the string. However, this doesn't seem to be working anymore. Now I was wondering if you could accomplish something similar in another way or if it it somehow possible to do with the FormattedMessage component instead of the FormattedHTMLMessage component.

This is the code:

 

    import React from "react";
    import { FormattedMessage as FM, FormattedHTMLMessage as FHM } from "react-intl";
    
    export default props =&gt; { 
        return(
        	...
            &lt;p className="fs-18 white-space-pre-line"&gt;
                &lt;FM id={props.descriptionKey} /&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            ...
        );
    };

&amp;#x200B;

The json file looks something like this: 

    textDescription: "Sometext &lt;span class='font-tilde-bold h3'&gt;Sometext&lt;/span&gt; Sometext"

Now I am just passing the string of the json file to the component and inserting it and it will just display the html elements in the text.
