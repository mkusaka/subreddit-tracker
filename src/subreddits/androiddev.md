This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi,

I have an app which has nice daily installs, it is in top 10-15 for a few popular keywords.

Two separate guy reached me via email. They would like to add a line to my app-ads.txt, so I could sell advertising places in my app for them.  


I don't really get this, what does this means? Is it means that my ad units will be still present but it will show their ads? Or should I make new ad units for them?  


Why is it worth to me? How can I be sure that their ad traffic will be bettern than the regular ad traffic?

&amp;#x200B;

By the way I use AdMob with banners, interstitial ads and rewarded ads.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,  
Adam

I'm very new to Android development, I've only just started learning, so forgive me if my question is dumb. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I made an app can I have that app make APK files?

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothetical example:

I give the user a bunch of options and then package those options into their own apk that the user could install or give to another to install.

I am curious about what are your strategies for reading articles and watching conferences, learning Coroutines finally :).

Most of us are working under time constraints and there's very little time one can use to sit back and mindfully watch a conference in the office. Then you're back home tired, kinds, wives, hobbies, laziness. And you think - okay, I'll do it over the weekend, but the weekend comes and you feel like you need to pause in order to regain all your energy to come back full of it on Monday.

The circle has closed.
## [10][Trying to display combined code coverage from local and instrumented tests inside Android Studio](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fheu43/trying_to_display_combined_code_coverage_from/)

From some time I have been using this kind of Jacoco configuration to create a combined coverage report from Instrumented and Local Unit tests:

[jacoco.gradle](https://gist.github.com/jstefanowski/e21c04da55982a9bab1ff41cd959465f)

This is not as convenient as running tests directly in IDE but this is the only way I know to run both types of tests at once.

One reason why running tests in Android Studio is nicer is that it can show you coverage percentage in the Project files tab and highlight untested lines directly in code. Today I have found that there is a way to import that data. If you go to Analyze | Show Code Coverage Data | "+" you can select \*.exec generated during local tests run. Instrumented tests are creating \*.ec files but if you change the extension to \*.exec it will work perfectly fine :) 

The only problem with this solution is that you have to import those files manually after each jacoco execution. Does anyone know if there is a way to add those files automatically? Or if there is a way to run those tests using Run Configuration in Android Studio, because the Intellij UI for test runs looks better than the command line logs :)

Hello!

I'm a solo developer with a couple of Android games published, and I've just received an email rejecting one of the latest updates I published.

The email contains the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Issue****: Violation of Families Policy RequirementsApps that contain elements that appeal to children must comply with all Families Policy Requirements. We found the following issue(s) with your app:*  
&gt;  
&gt;***App: First level links***  
*The weblinks in your app are not consistent with our policy. For any link provided within the app, the content must have a rating of E or E10+ and be compliant with our global policies. To resolve this issue, please remove non-compliant links and/or remove any inappropriate content displayed on these linked pages.*

&amp;#x200B;

After reading and looking around, my conclusion is that, when I selected the "Appeal to children" option when I first uploaded the game, it probably made the app be more restricted on what links I have…

The links I have in the app (in the About section) are to the Reddit page, the Discord channel and the Twitter account. I've just removed the Twitter one, and also have updated the "content rating" / "App content", but I'm not sure if that's going to be enough… Is it allowed to have links to Reddit/Discord places from an Android app?

I'm kind of scared because I've read so many times about apps being suspended (I even got one suspended some years ago, and it's terrible…).

Well, thank you all in advance, and sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share in case someone has faced the same issue and also to maybe help others who find themselves in a similar situation :)

FYI com.curtiscollins.classytaxi, you've got a problem that needs fixing.
