I am making an algorithms visualizer using sorting algorithms. The user is able to choose different algorithms from a toolbar and the appropriate algorithm will be applied to a randomly generated array of elements. I also have user side stuff that I am trying to implement. I am trying to setup routing between everything but I am running into some problems. I have linked the repo below and will refer to files from it. In Routes.js, I have set up the paths to each component. If I use "exact path" for the home page, the routing will work just fine. However, I am then unable to choose different sorting algorithms (due to the way I set this up, the url will be updated to localhost:3000/name-of-sorting-algorithm). Any possible solutions for this? I have tried using exact path for the other components but that doesn't seem to work either.

Hi,

I have created a build resume website using Reactjs and would love to know your feedback.

Website URL is [https://build-resume.netlify.com/](https://build-resume.netlify.com/). I know there is a lot to fix in terms of CSS design, but I was excited to share what I have accomplished. It's not much but I want to improve this. Please give feedback in terms of CSS, features I should be adding or fix. Star the repo if you like it - :) Github URL - [https://github.com/knowankit/build-resume](https://github.com/knowankit/build-resume).

I have searched this problem all over the web and none of them seem to solve my problem. I am using react and I am waiting for a response of center and location. I load the div first and then the content. here is my react code.

    &lt;div className="HomeMap"&gt;
            &lt;ErrorModal error={error} onClear={clearError} /&gt;
            {isLoading &amp;&amp; (
              &lt;div className="loadCenter"&gt;
                &lt;LoadingSpinner /&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            )}
            
              {!isLoading &amp;&amp; &lt;div className="map"&gt;(
                &lt;Map
                  className="HomeMap"
                  center={{
                    lat: latitude,
                    lng: longitude
                  }}
                  zoom={8}
                  location={MarkersMap}
                /&gt;
              )&lt;/div&gt;}
            
          &lt;/div&gt;

css

    .map {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }
    
    .HomeMap {
      height: 85% !important;
      width: 46% !important;
      display: block !important;
      left: auto !important;
      position: fixed !important;

      margin-top: 5rem;
      margin-bottom: 20rem;
      top: 0px;
      bottom: 0px;
    }

map component

    import React, { useRef } from "react";
    
    import "./Map.css";
    
    const Map = props =&gt; {
      const mapRef = useRef();

      try {

          center: center,
          zoom: zoom,
          // location: location
        });
    
         location.map(location =&gt; {
          location.lat = parseFloat(location.lat);
          location.lng = parseFloat(location.lng);
            return new window.google.maps.Marker({ position: location, map: map });
        })
     } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    
      return (
        &lt;div
          ref={mapRef}
          className={`map ${props.className}`}
          location={props.location}

## [11][Issues with using conditionally rendered components as a navigation substitute?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ffrmxh/issues_with_using_conditionally_rendered/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ffrmxh/issues_with_using_conditionally_rendered/
---
Hypothetically, if I was to use conditionally rendered components as a way to handle navigation, would there be any issues on doing so?

Let's assume this is nested inside a content area of the page with buttons that change the state, and when that state is true, it renders the corresponding component.

**For example:**

`&lt;div&gt;`

`{ isActive1 ? &lt;component1 /&gt; : null }`

`{ isActive2 ? &lt;component2 /&gt; : null }`

`{ isActive3 ? &lt;component3 /&gt; : null }`

...

`&lt;/div&gt;`

I get that there are navigation libraries made for a reason...but I'm just curious as to whether this would be a solution to a kind of sub-navigation thingo...
