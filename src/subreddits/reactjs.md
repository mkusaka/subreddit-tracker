[small video demo](https://reddit.com/link/it2mls/video/d1rm37m109n51/player)

Hey fellow Programmers,

This is my first proper post in this community. Bare with me :)

So I have created an OS simulator with react and thinking of the use cases I thought maybe I can make an OS themed interactive resume for myself. It is fully written by myself probably that's why the code is clunky. I would like people to check this out, So Please take a look and let me know what you guys think of this :)

Link of demo : [Click Here](https://rajagopalan-gangadharan.github.io/Portfolio/)

Repo Link: [Click Here](https://github.com/RAJAGOPALAN-GANGADHARAN/JS-OS) (Do give it a star if you like it )

&amp;#x200B;

Show me some ‚ù§ guys...

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. This is just a WIP and I can help any beginners who would love to contribute to the project.

P.P.S. It is not optimized for mobiles yet. Please try this on a PC thanks üòÑ

## [10][React input tagging/tokens library that supports copy/paste](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/it7dn4/react_input_taggingtokens_library_that_supports/)

Does anybody know of a tag/token input library that allows copy-paste?

https://github.com/olahol/react-tagsinput seems to be the most popular lib, but once tags are entered they become impossible to interact with, except to delete them individually. They have [a demo](https://olahol.github.io/react-tagsinput/) for example, and ctrl+a just selects the understanding plain text, shift+left can't select tags, and you can't drag to select them either. That's not enough for my use case, where users are likely to frequently want to copy and paste chunks of the input, and want to ctrl+a then delete to clear the whole lot.

I want to enter a few tags, then press ctrl/cmd+a, ctrl+x (leaving the input entirely empty), ctrl+p, and end up with the tags I started with.

Gmail's email input does this perfectly. Stack overflow's tag input isn't quite as elegant, but effectively makes the same thing work.

Is there a react component anywhere that can do this?
## [11][Made an I18n lib that automates entire workflow](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/it750n/made_an_i18n_lib_that_automates_entire_workflow/)

**GitHub:** [**https://github.com/FallenMax/a18n**](https://github.com/FallenMax/a18n)

This lib wraps and extract text in js/ts/jsx/tsx files using AST manipulation, making adding i18n support a breeze. 

It's already running in a dozen of my company product for 2 years so I think it's mature enough to promote. 

(NOTE: \`wrap\` feature is only available for *non-English* projects due to technical reasons)

Thanks for any feedback!
## [12][Movies/TV web app built with React, GraphQL and Fastify](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/it481w/moviestv_web_app_built_with_react_graphql_and/)

I created this Movies/TV app just as a side project to understand all the finer details of building a Fullstack APP using React and GraphQL.

Project Home:  [https://github.com/prabhuignoto/flixy](https://github.com/prabhuignoto/flixy) 

Demo:  [https://movies.prabhumurthy.com](https://movies.prabhumurthy.com/movies)

[flixy\_demo](https://reddit.com/link/it481w/video/tlnmal1jl9n51/player)

The App is powered by  [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). 

Here is the complete tech stack which i used to build this app. 

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [Apollo Client &amp; Server](https://www.apollographql.com/)

Let me know what you guys think.  Feedback's &amp; suggestions are welcome.

Thanks
