## [8][[AskJS] Need help with crossword board generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/f8jyzq/askjs_need_help_with_crossword_board_generator/)

So I'm making a crossword board generator.

*  They can input the size(dimensions, like 20 cells by 20 cells)
* Select the squares that they want to have(obviously they don't want a 20x20 grid)

And then my code should take the crossword shape and ship it to a pdf, which they can then download/print. 

However, I don't really know if I am going the right route. Currently, I am trying to use a table, which the user can then click on the cells they want after inputting the dimensions. I don't really know how to do it.

My code so far: [https://codepen.io/test1234555/pen/jOPyPdB](https://codepen.io/test1234555/pen/jOPyPdB), a lot of it is just test code so far.

The table doesn't generate new table border lines when I increase the size, which is a problem.

Can anybody point me in the right direction/provide some helpful code, or provide alternative solutions to using a table? Thanks so much.
