Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I made sorting visualization using Raylib.

## [7][Vtable layout differences between Itanium and MSVC ABI under multiple inheritance](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ilbf1y/vtable_layout_differences_between_itanium_and/)

If you have a derived class inheriting from 2 base classes, and you override a virtual function in the second base class, the Itanium ABI requires the overriden virtual function to appear under the vtable of the first base class.

See [here](https://godbolt.org/z/rWMEnq) for an example. Class `CC` overrides function `v`, and you can see in Clang's vtable a `CC::v` under `AA`'s vtable. Whereas the MSCV ABI behaves as I would expect, only the `BB` vtable is changed, the `AA` vtable is unchanged. 

Any idea why the Itanium ABI behaves this way? And advantage to this?
