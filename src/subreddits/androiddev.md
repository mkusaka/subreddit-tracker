This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

As of now, I'm getting an error when I try to release a new production release for an app:

*"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later (7100000)"*

Anyone else getting this? 

EDIT: Can you guys access the chat option? I can't but if anyone else maybe they can do us all a favour and contact Support about this in real time?

At first I thought I was having connection issues but my connection is fine. When I click on EDIT RELEASE or CREATE RELEASE on any of my apps the loading bar just keeps showing and after like 10 seconds it shows "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later. (7100000)".  


I tried both Firefox and Chrome.

It was working fine for me yesterday...

I've an app for food delivery for a local restaurant.

A couple of others want the same thing for themselves. Will Play Store screw me up for similar apps?

## [11][Any libraries to sync local database with the server?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/id7k8u/any_libraries_to_sync_local_database_with_the/)

This is common scenario where one need to sync local database with the server. For managing things on client side one may use SQLDelight, Room. For server there can be a PostgreSQL with REST API.  

How to correctly sync changes in local database with the server? Is there any libraries written to help with this? since developing good algorithm is not an easy task. (ex: sync with DB migrations, tracking changes and syncing them)

If you got Firebase client library it is handled for us. But how to do this without Firebase?

Does Room, SQLDelight have APIs to help with database sync? ex: tracking deltas

Ad serving has been limited today. It shows no reason no violation. What should I do now? I have released many apps recently and grow my business recently. Then this event happened :( I didn't understand why there is something like that :( Anybody experienced the same issue?

Ad serving on your account is being temporarily limited while you’re starting to build and grow your audience. This limit gives us a chance to assess your traffic quality while protecting our advertisers and users. [Learn more about ad serving limits](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9493252?hl=en_US).

### What you can do

Continue to develop your apps and build your audience while we assess your app traffic. Also make sure you’re complying with the [AdMob and AdSense Program policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en_US). While this ad serving limit typically impacts publishers for less than 30 days, it may take longer in some cases.
