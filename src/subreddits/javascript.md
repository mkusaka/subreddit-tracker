I'm serious, I'm just looking at some articles with the intention of killing NodeJS, it's a little worrying that only NodeJS hate is focused.

Someone can tell me what's wrong with NodeJS, I think it's powerful enough to last a lifetime.

If it's by Typescript, I already use a framework in NodeJS that uses Typescript.

I am aware that HTMLAudioElement can consume files or streams. But we could also use HLS, RMTP or websockets to send chunks. What do you prefer and why?
