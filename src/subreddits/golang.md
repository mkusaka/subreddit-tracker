What I'm trying to do, I believe, is extremely standard, yet go modules are causing me to regret every decision.

Here's my app, fooApp. Various 3rd party imports such as "import github.com/authorA/mygolibrary/v3". I did `go mod init` followed by `go mod tidy` and I was able to get a solid build with `go build`, finding all the dependencies and such.

Now, I want to fork authorA's library so that I can make some fixes to eventually submit pull-requests. So, I went to github and forked it to "github.com/mememeB/mygolibrary". I then changed my import lines accordingly "import github.com/mememeB/mygolibrary/v3"

`go build` then fetches my library, but complains that mygolibrary is defined as authorA/mygolibrary but imported as mememeB/mygolibrary

Ok. So, some googling says I need to add a "replace" line in my go.mod file.

`replace github.com/authorA/mygolibrary/v3 =&gt; github.com/mememeB/mygolibrary/v3`

New error. "replacement module without version must be directory path" What? More searching.

`replace github.com/authorA/mygolibrary/v3 =&gt; github.com/mememeB/mygolibrary/v3 v0`

More complaints that mememeB's go.mod file defines the fork as authorA.

Must I really change everything (go.mod, all imports) in my fork to match my "url"? That makes submitting PR's insane because now there's tons more differences than originally needed.

What's the proper way to fork a module and use it in your apps?
