This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hello everyone,

So I am currently tasked with taking over an android project (moving from external to internal). I will be the sole developer for a while. I am tasked with handling the handover. They told me to take a look at the project but this is a pretty vague statement for me. Also because I am still a fairly new developer I've mostly worked on project where I started the project. My question is what should I "look at". Or how do I go about learning how the project works ?

Unfortunately the project is quite big and badly structured. (The MainActivity is 1500 lines long with no documentation.) So it feels like a herculean task to "take a look at". There's also a huge load of classes. In my opinion, too many for the scope of the project. 

I was wondering if you guys had any experience and advice for this type of situation?

Couple of weeks ago i posted my [MarkdownEditText](https://github.com/YahiaAngelo/MarkdownEditText) library, and here's a use case for it.

Noted is a Notes and Tasks app built with Kotlin, Koin dependency injection, MVVM structure, Coroutines, Material design components And Realm database.

You can:

\- Write Notes with text styles

\- Add and filter with categories

\- Make Tasks with reminders

Backups will be in the next update.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.

## [11][Pro Tip: If you don't use Google Assistant that often (or even if you do), you can configure Assistant gesture/button to launch any app (like Camera/Reddit/Instagram etc) with this open source app.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i7n6ma/pro_tip_if_you_dont_use_google_assistant_that/)

Disclaimer - I made this. No intent for profit (its free + no ads + open source). I just think the app itself or the source code may interest someone here.

**Download -** [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vwap.app_launcher_assistant&amp;referrer=utm_source%3DReddit%26utm_campaign%3Dandroiddev)

Instead of the default assistant app, you can launch any app on your phone by performing the Assistant gesture (bottom-edge-swipe-up/long press 'home' button) or via the assistant button on some phones (like Samsung)

A good use case for this app- quickly open the CAMERA app with the assistant gesture/button.- you don't have to stop what you are doing, minimise the current app, go to home screen, and then finally open the CAMERA app from the home screen shortcut (or worse from the app drawer).

Also, the app is open source. You can check out its [source code here](https://github.com/vinaywadhwa/App-Launcher-Assistant).
