Finished this recently, a kotlin only implementaiton of the CommonMark MarkDown spec, was a pretty interesting deeper dive into kotlin than I have ever done before, did profiling on a project for the first time, had to design the architecture of a medium sized project, and face some of the consequences of some of my decisions and how they impacted the programming experience

Why do we have the relaxed nullability checks instead of just making it a nullable type in the first place?

## [9][What's the reasoning behind Kotlins lack of enforcement of checked exceptions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/fe7tvx/whats_the_reasoning_behind_kotlins_lack_of/)

I always thought java was "good" in the way that it forced you to check exceptions. Kotlin being a bit more modern would likely have some proof that their way is "better", no? note, I've never fully understood exceptions and such in java. I've worked in codebases where they were heavily used, some where they weren't really used at all, and others where we were forced to create our own custom exceptions for like anything that could go wrong.

From a language design aspect, I'm curious if kotlin does this well, or is there some other language that does this better? PS. I'm sure most of this stuff is subjective, but I'm just really curious to hear thoughts and discuss.

I know Kotlin can be compiled to WASM via the Kotlin-native target, but I can't find any examples in the wild...
