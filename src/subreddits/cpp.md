Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

I am new to C++ and I have find out about this project only recently. I have tried Qt - mostly in Qt Creator IDE and some console stuff, obviously, Vaguely tried wxWidget but it was a pain to setup it on Ubuntu. So, installign Ultimate++ was extremely simple, there is a ton of examples and it feels good.

I haven't found vim keybinding option, probably is not there but I am not sure.

Check this latest article about U++:

[https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5268022/Getting-Started-with-Uplusplus-2020-1#why](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5268022/Getting-Started-with-Uplusplus-2020-1#why)

The author claims things like:

&gt;At the same time, U++ Core libraries provide about **3 times better performance**  than standard C++ library in areas like string operations and mapping,  which consist of a bulk of load in many scenarios (think e.g. about  processing JSON or parsing files).

What do you think about it and more importantly why is it not more known for creating apps that doesn't need flashy buttons and stuff and just work with a nice and simple BSD license?

Can somebody who is experienced in C++ check these comparisons and comment on them:

[https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$comparison$en-us.html](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$comparison$en-us.html)

I am probably missing something. What is the catch?

P.S. The reason I read the article on codeproject was... [Jet-Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTsF6_V3cT0). I was searching something about old ZX Spectrum games and wondering what my [three 80's heroes](https://doupe.zive.cz/clanek/10-osobnosti-ceske-herni-sceny-ktere-byste-meli-znat/ch-146306) of [Golden Triangle](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle) (Cybexlab, T.R.C., Fuxoft) do nowadays. Then I saw some hidden comment or something from Frantisek Fuka that Miroslav Fídler still does programming. And yes, it turns out that [Mirek Fídler](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_F%C3%ADdler) is the author of U++ and that codeproject article and... Jet-Story... and other things like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belegost_(video_game)) or [these](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/list?label_id=2918).

Let me try to explain what I want.

I want to sort a vector of custom objects. However, it is not enough for me to *only* compare variables of these objects. I need to use the variables of those objects *together* with some outside parameters.

For example I want to sort coordinates by distance to a third, external point. I want to overload **operator&lt;** so as to accept this additional parameter. If I'd have two points,  **A(-3, -4)** and **B(4, 3.6)**, and I want to calculate the distance from my reference point, say, **(0,0)**, then I want A &lt; B to be valid. (As in A's distance to my reference point is smaller than B's distance to my reference point).

Is there any good way of doing this?

Hello everyone, I just got my first job as a c++ dev. I just started training and I need some resources where I can learn the things that would make me an efficient c++ programmer. 

Any links and tutorials are much appreciated
## [8][Using C++20 features to eradicate boiler-plate associated with Result&lt;&gt;-based error-handling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/jczu4u/using_c20_features_to_eradicate_boilerplate/)

Just wanted to share a trick I have recently learnt, maybe it will be useful/interesting for others...

## The problem

I suppose everyone is familiar with the Result/Outcome-based approach to error-handling. If not, the main idea is that functions return `Result&lt;&gt;` (which is a wrapper that contains either error or result of execution).

The main problem with the approach is verbosity:

    /// Contains int on success, or explanation in std::string in case of an error
    TResult&lt;int, std::string&gt; ParseNumber(std::string_view FileName);
    
    // A function that uses ParseNumber():
    TResult&lt;int, std::string&gt; ReadSettings(std::string_view FileName) {
       TResult&lt;int, std::string&gt; IntOrError = ParseNumber(FileName);
       if(IntOrError.IsErr()) // Burdensome, error-prone, what if we forget to check it?
          return "Failed to ReadSettings: " + IntOrError.Err();
       int AdjustedSettings = std::max(1234, IntOrError.Ok());
       return AdjustedSettings;
    }

**This is both: verbose** (you have to constantly write `if()`'s) **and error-prone**, what if you forget to check `Result&lt;&gt;`?

## The solution: Coroutines

The above code will look like:

    TResult&lt;int, std::string&gt; ReadSettings(std::string_view FileName) {
       int Integer = co_await ParseNumber(FileName).OrPrependErrMsgAndReturn();
       co_return std::max(1234, Integer);
    }

(`OrPrependErrMsgAndReturn()` uses `std::source_location`, which gives name of function as well as line number, which are used to create human readable explanation).

In general:

    TOk Ok = co_await ExpressionOfTypeResult&lt;TOk, TErr&gt; . OrPrependErrMsgAndReturn();

will (depending on the contents of the Result expression):

* either extract Ok value from it and assign it to the variable on the left
* or return from the function what is specified as parameter of `OrPrependErrMsgAndReturn()` function.

If you are interested, here is [implementation](https://github.com/DimanNe/result) and [examples](https://github.com/DimanNe/result/blob/master/examples/main.cpp) and shortened version of the implementation in [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/8hxKTW).

PS Of course, it has always been possible to implement such behaviour with macros.

Hi, I just got my first job as c++ developer and am yet to go through training. But I just wanted to hear from the community about what the future is for c++?? While doing my bachelor's. everyone was like c++ was only used for learning the fundamentals and  soon it will cease to exist. I just want to know what all can a cpp developer can do? Are there any opportunity?
