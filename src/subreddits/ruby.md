I have just released a new gem called `capistrano-precompile-chooser`. It is a Capistrano plugin to precompile your Rails assets locally, remotely, or not at all provided with a very convenient default terminal prompt.

Hello,

I recently wrote an article about an blog post (linked in the article) from a programmer who had moved from Ruby to Clojure and then back to Ruby, and why I thought some of the statements he had made about Clojure were wrong.

I posted it to the Clojure community, and they reasonably pointed out that I was unlikely to much valuable insight from preaching to the choir, and suggested I put it in front of some Ruby programmers. 

So here is [simple vs. easy](https://redpenguin101.github.io/posts/2020_08_18_simplevseasy.html). I'd appreciate any feedback you have.
