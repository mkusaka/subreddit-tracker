I'm looking to migrate [my Ruby on Rails app](https://www.mugshotbot.com) from Heroku to Digital Ocean. I don't have any dev-ops experience and am very confused on where to start.

Does anyone have any beginner tutorials or links I could work through?

Hi!

*Short version:* I'm planning on writing an editor with an image uploader. The images have to be uploaded seperately from the rest of the form via AJAX, so that the server can return permanent URLs that can then be used in the editor. How would I go about this? Do I need an extra Image model or can I still attach those images to my original Page/Post/whatever model?

*Long version:*

I want to create an image upload feature for my current project. More specifically, it should accept images via an API. The idea is to have 2 forms on a page:

1. the normal contents form
2. a form for images, submitted via JavaScript

After the images have been submitted via JavaScript, I need permanent URLs to those images being sent back so I can use them in the first form. Ugh, I hope you understand what I mean.

Hi! I hope everyone is fine,  
I have a task in which I have to implement CKEditor in rails, My work is from the backend side so I have to implement this on my API , After searching many tutorials I find each for the monolithic structure but just not for API,    
Maybe it is easy just for API but I don't know how to do it &amp; how it works with API?    
Can anyone please guide me?  or show me the path to implement this?

So, to save time, I purchased a bootstrap theme online for my project. I am having difficulty integrating it . Confused by webpacker /asset pipeline file system. 
Could anyone walk me through the process or point me to a tutorial on how to properly integrate my bootstrap theme into rails 6 ?

tl;dr: lost interest in web dev, learnt Rails, have just completed rewriting my old homepage; thanks to the Rails community for helping me get through this.

---

Hi! Over the past month, I've completely rewritten my homepage from scratch, in Ruby using Rails. This was my very first real Rails project and I'm so proud that I can finally say that it's (nearly) completed.

I come from a background of many languages, but mostly php. Don't get me wrong, php is an awesome language and if you're interested in a typed scripting language with a Java-like OOP system, then php is probably your best bet.

I've been doing web development in my freetime for nearly 4 years now and I really lost interest lately. The only app that I was still maintaining was my homepage. It had a pretty old php code base from when I was a complete newbie to software development.

From side projects which I had long since discontinued, I gained much, much more knowledge in software development and became what I would consider to be quite a good developer. My homepage was my only project left that was not a library or small tool, and considering its age, I thought of rewriting it.

Long story short, I couldn't bring up the motivation. Started it a few times using different frameworks, but always discontinued the project after a few days. I think I just knew my stack too well and got bored of it. In the end, it was just repeating the same tasks I did a thousand times already, once again. I think you could say that I was in some kind of coding depression.

I came to the conclusion that I needed to learn a new framework or maybe even a whole new language. I tried PHP/Slim, PHP/Symfony (granted, that really was not new to me...), Python/Django and even a few more.

After looking for more frameworks to try, I found Rails. I already knew Rails (not really), because I dabbled with it around 2 years ago. Back then, I dropped it because I neither understood Rails nor Ruby. Having heard great things about Ruby and Rails and having seen the Ruby community as really friendly, calm devs whose projects "just work", I really got interested in it again.

I started learning Ruby using [the Programming Ruby book](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) and Rails using several YouTube tutorials and blogs. I felt as if Rails is the right thing for my homepage, so I started working on it (based off of a 45min YouTube video, even though the code base has completely changed since then).

After having understood Rails' basics (where does it get the views/layouts from, how does webpacker work, how do all the helpers work, how do I validate input, how do I query a database, ...), it became pretty easy and I could work on it all by myself, no tutorial needed anymore.

I still ran into quite some problems (looking through my post history, I made 9 posts on here over the past month), which I consulted you guys for. All my questions got answered! And this is just a big thank you to all of you! This community gave me a really warm welcome and I feel right at home here. I joined this sub when I started my Rails journey and in the future I'd like to help others new to Rails too. Rails has an incredibly awesome community.

Also, the people from Stack Overflow, numerous blogs around the web, YouTubers making tutorials and developers writing libraries, deserve all an equally big thank you. To me, it feels like those resources are often not appreciated as much as they should be.

My site is now live and I'm going to Open Source it very soon. I'd love to post a link, but I don't want my Reddit account to be associated with my homepage/IRL personality.

So, again, thank you to all of you! ;)

Hello everyone,

I've got a question. Is it possible to create a ruby on rails csv or xls file uploader which will save it on a database and make the data available in the future? The work flow would be something like uploading the file, treating or cleaning the data internally, and then making it visible as on a table (main) with only info of the user that uploaded the file, the date created at and the name of the file and making this data editable (which would take the user to another table where the data of the csv is visible) or deletable (this would also delete the csv table as well). I'm seeing it as a table within a table but I'm not sure what is the correct route for this implementation.

**What I've been thinking:** So, since the main table (the table that has the user info) would share the user that uploaded the csv with the table of the "CSV" upload, then when the user decides to view the data, it would show the data related to the upload. Know this means that everytime the user uploads the file, it would create a database for this file? is this viable? The csv file would have 200 rows by 15 columns where the rows can vary 10 rows.

Thanks.

I'm trying to fix the page loading performance of my web application. Right now there is no caching. Here is an example feature that I am trying to optimize: 

User clicks a page to see all of the versions of a code build across multiple deployments. The code fires API calls to AWS DynamoDB to check tables for version information and renders the information to the page. 

Problem is that API calls are slow and also cost money. How can I cache the information returned from the database so that when a user loads the page it gets the data from the cache and not fire off API calls?

Hey Rails nerds,

I've been working on my first big rails app for a while. We're just getting around to building out the mobile side and testing it on phones. 

When submitting a form on my iPhone 8, I get this strange message asking me if i want to download createOrderBuy - this, by the way, is the back end target of the form i'm submitting. My form\_with looks like this:

    &lt;%= form_with(url: "/stock/createOrderBuy",remote: true, method: "post", id: "buyForm", html: { class: "needs-validation", novalidate: true }) do %&gt; 

I've included the download prompt I get on mobile. After googling around and trying a few things I haven't had any luck. Any guidance or advice is appreciated. Thank you!

Is there a way to bypass optimistic lock? 

I have added **lock_version** colummn to my model, and there's a few occasion like in a background job  I want the code to be able to ignore the lock_version check and update the model attributes (so no StaleObjectError will be raised), but still undergo some custom validation I defined in model, hence I can't use save(validation: false)

I tried model.reload.update(attribute: value) but sometimes it still throws ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError

Any Ideas? I have googled for 2 hours but no answer for this
