This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

That's it. I have  a lot of free time since i work from home, i did a translation to spanish of a small bot app on the playstore and since i think there are a lot of starting independent developers i'll give them a hand. 

Im doing up to 500-1000 words, not doing ToS or anything like that.  


 Anyone can PM me (:

Just finished a course on material design, and they reviewed how to create animations. My question is, is it common to create your own animations, our do you guys just outsource the functionality to a UI library. This seems very complex. I am a noob so if this seems like a nooby question it is.

Are there any BLE enabled activity trackers out there with a documented protocol? I want to learn more about making android apps that use BLE and thought it would be fun to display stats collected from an activity tracker. I've found articles about mi bands, but it seems Xiaomi/Haumi have been gradually making it harder for others wanting to communicate with the device.

For a university project we need to implement a contact tracking app.


The application requirements cannot be met through the Apple/Google API so we will have to work directly with the BLE.


What limitations would you have if you chose to work directly with BLE?  Is it necessary that the application is always open or something like that?

Good morning!

Over the past few months, I've started developing android apps and it has been a great experience so far. I graduated from school last year, but I had a tough time finding a job so I just decided to focus on improving my skillset as a developer so that I could be ready if an opportunity comes to me. I would love to connect with other like-minds so we can help each other grow in the years to come! If you have some advice or if you just want to reach out, don't hesitate to message me! I look forward to hearing your thoughts! I really appreciate this community here and I hope you all enjoy your day!
