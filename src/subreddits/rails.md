Hello Everyone. I've been surfing through the internet on how to create a web app but so far I haven't gotten enough Information. 
First Question: Can I create a cross platform web app with Ruby on Rails?
2nd: Can I create the app alone with no other team member?
3rd: Will the back end,frontend and database be created on one the same framework?
## [3][dynamically creating ActionCable subscriptions in asset pipeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/gpx1hi/dynamically_creating_actioncable_subscriptions_in/)

In expanding that DHH YouTube tutorial for an ActionCable chatroom, I came across a [more fleshed out example](https://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/rails-5-action-cable-with-multiple-chatroom-subscriptions/) that loops through all existing conversations and creates a subscription for each. This approach "works," but it essentially hardcodes the app's current number of conversations into the asset pipeline, and then leaves it as is until the assets are regenerated. So really, it's not too usable.  

What approaches have you taken to dynamically create ActionCable subscriptions?

**assets/javascripts/channels/messages.coffee**

    &lt;% Conversation.all.each do |conversation| %&gt;
        App['conversation_' + &lt;%= conversation.id %&gt;] = App.cable.subscriptions.create { 
          channel: "MessagesChannel", conversation: &lt;%= conversation.id %&gt; 
        }, 
        {
          connected: -&gt;
            console.log 'Connected'
    
          disconnected: -&gt;
            console.log 'Disconnected'
    
          received: (data) -&gt;
            $("[data-conversation-id='" + data.conversation_id + "']").append(data.message)
            $("#conversation-main").scrollTop($("#conversation-main")[0].scrollHeight);
    
          speak: (body, conversation_id) -&gt;
            @perform 'speak', body: body, conversation_id: conversation_id
    
          set_conversation_id: (conversation_id) -&gt;
            console.log conversation_id
            this.conversation_id = conversation_id
        }
    
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    
      $(document).on 'turbolinks:load', -&gt;
        submit_message()
        scroll_bottom()
    
      submit_message = () -&gt;
        $('#response').on 'keydown', (event) -&gt;
          if event.keyCode is 13
            conversation_id = $("[data-conversation-id]").data("conversation-id")
            # values = $(this).serializeArray()
            App['conversation_' + conversation_id].set_conversation_id(conversation_id)
            App['conversation_' + conversation_id].speak(event.target.value, conversation_id)
            event.target.value = ""
            event.preventDefault()
    
      scroll_bottom = () -&gt;
        if $('#messages').length &gt; 0
          $('#messages').scrollTop($('#messages')[0].scrollHeight)

Hello, been hearing great things about the Bulma css framework and decided to try it out this weekend. Started a new Rails 6 app and run "yarn add bulma", then added this line to the application layout file &lt;%= stylesheet\_pack\_tag 'application' %&gt;, then also added the file "application.scss" to the packs directory with the contents as follows:

    import "~bulma";

...and with that, somehow Bulma's styles are not getting pulled...what could I be doing wrong?

Hoping to add some navbar links that will link to a section of my home page. A little bit of background on this: 

Have welcome#index root path that is to be a portfolio. The portfolio has different sections to it: about, projects, recent articles, contact form, and resume link. I've figured all of it out thus far, but the navbar looks rather empty with just a link to the blog portion (articles/index). So, I'm hoping to add some extra links to the navbar that can auto-scroll to a section of the page. However, I'm at a bit of a loss as to what is best practice for this.

Do I just write up some JS for this and set some section ID's to auto-scroll to? If I am in the blog page and click one of these links, would it still load if I am using some JS for this functionality? Is there a gem that can handle something this simple with little to no marginal cost on performance? What would you do for this?

Hi all,

is there any gem available which is recommendable to create a folder hierarchy by the user for a file storage?

I would like to let users upload their document within a document structure created by themselves.

thanks for your tips.

Let's say I want to show only posts for a particular post creation date, which is received from

URL like this (year/month/day): http://localhost:3000/launches/2020/5/24

How do I go about achieving this? 

PS I'm using Rails 6
