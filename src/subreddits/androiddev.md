This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

**How to download the songs?**

You can download all of them in one RAR &amp; ZIP file by following this [Bandcamp](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/releases) link.

**Is this album updated regularly?**

Yes! Whenever I add a new song or sound effect to the library, I announce it on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onemansymphony). I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDhmSe6HNJgAAfAjNZlrxDg?view_as=subscriber) where I upload the songs to. I would suggest checking the tweets/videos or the album page regularly if you're in need of new music frequently.

**What's the total size of the library and in which format do they come in?**

Total file size varies in format. You can download the songs in MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, ALAC, WAV and AIFF formats.

**How can I support this project?**

I'm planning to expand this library's content as much as possible, and doing so takes a great amount of time, and calls for new virtual instruments and tools to create songs in rich and different sound. My current goal is to keep adding more songs in different genres into this library as well as creating environmental sound effects in high quality.  Also Bandcamp limits the quantity of free downloads so I need to buy more "free download credits" to make the album even more accessible. More information about the subject can be found [​here](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2010/09/09/free-downloads-power-ups/). Due to these reasons, I created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony) page if you'd like to support this project. I'm using the donations I'm getting through Patreon to buy new virtual instruments at the moment. By becoming a Patron, **you'll get access to the loop files, bonus and alternative songs and sound effects** that are not included in the public library hosted on Bandcamp.

**Can I listen to these songs on Spotify?**

Yes! Uploading the songs to Spotify takes longer than uploading them to Bandcamp so not all of the songs are available on Spotify yet, but you can listen to some of them by following this [Spotify link.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2thNcRskFqUVCvEZnjrSGl?si=rP0D7jhjSGu1weaLN1jx5Q)

**What about the license? (CC BY 4.0)**

You can use any song in this library in anyway you want, be it as a sound effect in your game or as a background music in one of your Youtube &amp; Twitch videos, even commercially. If you'd like to find more information about the license, please check this [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) link. Providing an appropriate credit (Either Composed by [onemansymphony.bandcamp.com](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com) or patreon.com/onemansymphony) is required.

**How should I credit you?**

You can provide a link to one of the websites above in your project's description section (Youtube, Vimeo, etc). If you're planning to use them in a movie, you can provide one of the links in the rolling credit section.

**Are these songs loopable?**

Almost every single song in the album (with a few exceptions here and there) is loopable. While producing these songs, I always paid extra attention to make them as loopable as possible since some users would like to break a song into seperate pieces and just want to use that specific section of the song in their projects, and some people might like to extend a specific part of the song for adaptive sound design purposes. I am very well aware of that modern video games call for an application of adaptive sound design. A song which is made of different sections should be easily loopable &amp; cuttable and any section of the song should be easily extandable. And whenever a transition occurs, it should sound as smooth as possible. These were the things that I kept in my mind while composing these pieces. If you'd like to create your own loop files out of these songs, you can use a free software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to do so and refer to its [manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/) to learn more about how looping is done. If you don't want to spend your time with the process of looping, you can subscribe to my $1 tier on Patreon where you can get access to the loop files of the songs in the library.

**Will you make different/alternative versions of the songs?**

I already did this with some songs such as Uncharted Planet and After The Disaster, and I keep planning to do so.  I think it's important to be able to evoke different emotions by using different variations of a main theme. Having and using alternative tracks also help with maintaining the musical integrity of the main medium/emotion.

**What DAW do you use to compose these songs?**

Mostly FL Studio.

**If I suggested a theme, would you compose something that in theme?**

I'm definitely open to new ideas! I can't make any promises on if I will definitely compose something in that theme/mood/genre and how long completing it would take, but please feel free to make suggestions if you think there is a lack of resources in a genre/mood/theme/etc.

**Why do you do this?**

A few years ago I was creating my own scenes in a game engine and Blender 3D. Sometimes, needed some tracks to test the scenes to see how things were getting together. I realized that even though it was relatively easy to find tracks that sound 8-bit, it was pretty difficult to find high quality and various tracks in other genres such as ambient and BGM. So instead of waiting for someone to create such album, I did it myself. (I've been writing music since I was a kid so I thought why not record and share them with people who might be in need of them just like I was.)

**Do you do commissions?**

I do and I offer very reasonable prices. You can contact me on Twitter if you have an idea and would like to discuss it with me.

Feel free to ask if you guys have any questions.

I noticed this with my app recently, the only reason I can think is that I changed the category for my app, could that be it?

Interested to generally hear what the usual reasons are for big sudden drops in installs.

Thanks

I am working on my first cross-platform app with RN and I've been uploading test builds for iOS users in my team for over a week but I'm still stuck trying to get a test build release out for Android users (only one Android user on the team too).

Is there an internal release track that doesn't require an app review by Google?

If the answer to that is 'no', why? Is this a security thing? And how is an internal release a possible threat to Google Play users? (apart from your colleagues whom you obviously despise 😈)

&amp;#x200B;

[After filling out all the forms and uploading the app bundle, the release status became \\"Full roll-out\\" but the testers on the email list didn't get invited and there is no link to share.](https://preview.redd.it/zndx7220z5h51.jpg?width=556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e09a0a8ff9e6a2cd99f02fb039c2c123008b5ba)

I just started my app development journey ! And my question to fellow developers out there is ..

What all should I need to know ? Like programming languages ? (I am learning kotlin by the way) 

Other languages that are essential? Libraries that I need to know ? 

Resources where I can keep updating myself with latest news in the field? 

ANY HELP IS APPRECIATED!
