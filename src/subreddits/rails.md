Hi guys, I recently picked rails for my next side project since it offers everything I need out of the box :)

I need to develop a rest api backend, so I created an app with the "only api" flag. I'm following some tutorials on GoRails but I'm looking for a good open source project to learn from.

Since I'm building an API, I'm looking for a project that includes a API.

Thanks :)

I found a few cool templates, but most of them are made by people for educational purposes. I really suck at frontend design and everything related. I just need to know where's the treasure box!

This is how the message I get for a failure in minitest   


    Expected response to be a &lt;200&gt;, but was &lt;500&gt;.
            Expected: 200
              Actual: 500

How can I get the full backtrace to understand where it gave a 500? 

  
Something like mentioned in this [https://gist.github.com/jeremyvdw/1001999](https://gist.github.com/jeremyvdw/1001999)

Is there an accepted best practice way of doing this, or do I just have to manually copy and paste any changes I make?

I'm working on a rails 6 application ( i generated a controller with his view (index/show/edit) ) 

but on the show page i have to add a show some images so i'm going to use swiperJS  (like this exemple not mine btw) https://codepad.co/snippet/swiper-thumbs-gallery-with-two-way-control

so i need to add the JS and CSS to the show page only 

a did a:

    yarn add swiper 

and to the javascript folder i added a new file called GallerieSwiper.js which contant my JS 

and in my show.html.erb page i added:

    &lt;%= javascript_pack_tag 'GallerieSwiper' %&gt;


the issue is how to add the swiper.min.css to only the show view ? 

i can't added in the top of the page as it is a subview of the application.html.erb that contant the whole website structure

Hi All,

Hope everyone is staying safe.

I'm currently hiring for a Senior Ruby Engineer who has implemented Elasticsearch as an indexing solution. We’re an AI startup with offices in London and Berlin who have grown to 55 people in the last 5 years. We’re working on cutting edge AI technology, supported by a small team of machine learning experts and a collaborative product team that enables our clients to make data driven decisions using 100k+ customer feedback to improve their product.

As a Senior Ruby Engineer at Chattermill, you’ll be working on greenfield products as well as interesting performance optimisation problems. You will be involved in all steps of the project including design, architecture, implementation, automated tests development and monitoring the health of the systems in production. This role can be fully remote (within EU timezone) or be based in our London or Berlin office (when it's safe to open up again).

This opportunity would suit: 

* Someone who values autonomy and would relish working on new challenges
* Has a growth mindset and wants to work with likeminded people
* Wants to work on complex scaling problems
* Wants to work in a high impact role within a startup but at the same time has a good work/ life balance

What we’re after:

* Someone with good knowledge of software design and architecture 
* Proficient with PostgreSQL and has experience with large datasets.
* Experience with Elasticsearch as an indexing solution
* Someone who values working within a close knit team and is willing to help and support others 

You can apply via: [https://grnh.se/a87508f63us](https://grnh.se/a87508f63us) or contact me directly if you have any questions via [jason@chattermill.io](mailto:jason@chattermill.io).

Hi guys, I'm using Active Model Serializer and I'm having trouble updating a user. I'm not sure what to do to solve this problem? 

I get this error message.   

`app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb:19
[active_model_serializers] Rendered ActiveModel::Serializer::Null with Hash (0.09ms)` 

My registrations_controller is:

	`def update
		@user = User.find(params[:id])
		if @user.assign_attributes(registration_params)
			render json: @user
		else
			render json: { status: :bad_request }
		end	
	end`	


Here is my User Serializer:

`
class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer
  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  attributes  :id, :first_name, :last_name, :email, :photo_url, :login_status
  
  attributes :photo_url
  def photo_url
    variant = object.photo.variant(resize: "80x80")
    return rails_representation_url(variant, only_path: true)
  end  

  def login_status
    {
      status: :created,
      logged_in: true
    }
  end   
end`

Hey,

I wrote a gem to manage sitemap, robots.txt, error pages, etc.

Things to optimize SEO, you know \^\^ ...

It uses the "sitemap\_generator" gem. 

I would like to have your opinions, comments and contributions on this. 

The first goal is to easily and efficiently manage SEO on a Rails application. 

You can find the source code here: [https://github.com/RonanLOUARN/seo\_optimizer](https://github.com/RonanLOUARN/seo_optimizer)

Have a great day!

Hey guys, having a really puzzling time with everyones favorite daterangepicker. I had it working completely fine, and then all of a sudden the jquery has gone haywire on me! Im hoping someone ehre has experience with this issue.

Ive started getting the 

    Uncaught TypeError: $(...).daterangepicker is not a function

error in my console, and the page breaks. I havent changed my application.js, gemfile, nor stylesheets since it was working, hoping to get some assistance here. From doing some research it seems that the function is being loaded before jquery is, but I am mystified as to why this is happening.

Here are my files:
