This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

I've seen some apps grow from 10k downloads to 1M+ downloads in just a month. How do they do it?
## [7][I created a Navigation Components tutorial that covers nested NavHostFragments with ViewPager2, BottomNavigationView, Dynamic Feature Modules and more](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i0jdsp/i_created_a_navigation_components_tutorial_that/)

Tutorials for learning Navigation Components starting with simple set up, continues with adding top menus, passing arguments via navigation graphs and combining them with different Material Design widgets such as BottomNavigationView, ViewPager2, TabLayout, FragmentFactory(not working as i expected with ViewPager2), and dynamic feature module navigation as shown in the image. Here is the [link for repo](https://github.com/SmartToolFactory/NavigationComponents-Tutorials) if you wish to look. 

&amp;#x200B;

And there are some issues including how to change BottomNavigationView extension to be usable with DynamicNavHostFragment when it's included with other fragments in BottomNavigation. I used two ViewPager2 for the example shown in the image. since it crashes with

&gt; Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not find Navigator with name "include-dynamic". You must call NavController.addNavigator() for each navigation type.      at androidx.navigation.NavigatorProvider.getNavigator(NavigatorProvider.java:98)      at androidx.navigation.NavInflater.inflate(NavInflater.java:107)      at androidx.navigation.NavInflater.inflate(NavInflater.java:141)      at androidx.navigation.NavInflater.inflate([NavInflater.java:88](https://NavInflater.java:88))

Since NavHostFragment.create returns NavHostFragment instead of type T extends NavHost

Hi so I have a simple one page website of links like [Drudgereport.com](https://Drudgereport.com). I wanted to ask if this [Gonative.io](https://Gonative.io) app service can help us create an android app for our website?

Has anyone used [Gonative.io](https://Gonative.io)? Is it any good? Is there a better service? Some tips would be useful. Thanks!

Hey! 

Im about to start developing an existing app from vb in android studio. The db is already made, i converted it to SQLite db file. 

The question is... Is suitable using Room for this? Or i should make entities that comunicates with the Db simply using SQLite.

I have a laptop with a Ryzen 4000 CPU, Windows 10 and want to use Android Studio (especially Flutter) alongside with Docker to run linux containers with Backend API logic+database.

Which configuration do I need to have the android emulator running with hardware acceleration and also running Docker containers fast? Enable or Disable Hyper-v, install Android Emulator Accelerator for AMD or not, etc.
