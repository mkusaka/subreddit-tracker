Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/frfduy/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hi, Rust noob here.

I've just read chapter 7 of "the book". And I'd like to know when I would want to use a library crate and when I wouldn't. Is a library crate what other languages would just call a 'library/package' and therefore if I want to share my work for others I use [lib.rs](https://lib.rs)? If so how would that look?  Also how do I use my own library, my understanding was that it creates a crate with the same name as my project so using `mod [project name]` should import it?

&amp;#x200B;

Same questions for having multiple binary crates, when would I use multiple crates and how?

Since balance trees frequently re-assign pointers and move ownership, the implementation provides very good understanding of Rust's ownership system. This repository provides an AVL tree implementation that is as concise as possible for Rust learning.

As the Title says i have a few questions about doing things in gstreamer using rust as i am quite confused where to start as a lot of the information Ive found is either unclear, not up to date or not related to what im trying to do

Here are the things im figure out how to do

1. Ingest live video from a client software (e.g OBS) using the SRT Protocol and then output it using either DASH, HLS, WebRTC or some combination of those three
2. Convert Video, Images and audio that i wont know the format of ahead of time to a web compatible format

if someone could help point me the right direction of how to accomplish these things i would really appreciate it
