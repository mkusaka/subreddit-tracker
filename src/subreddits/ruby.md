Hello!

I was using Ruby quite extensively few years ago, I believe I got good grasp of it. I had some break because every company I worked for in the meantime was \*Pythonized\*. I would like to get back to this beautiful technology - and get to know all the good stuff that happened in between. I was thinking of reading a book on Ruby, cover to cover. Which would you recommend to me? I'd like it to cover at least Ruby 2.5. 

Caveat: I'm not interested in RoR at all, I just enjoy using Ruby as a scripting language over Python. I'm a C++ / Rust developer.

In my ruby code I acquire a resource in the constructor. A resource is acquired via FFI:

        class MyFFI
          extend FFI::Library
        
          # [.........]
    
          attach_function :get_external_resource [], :uint32
          attach_function :destroy_external_resource, :uint32, :void
        end
        
        class MyRecource
          def initialize
            @res1 = MyFFI.get_external_resource
          end
    
          def my_destroy
            MyFFI.destroy_external_resource(@res1)
          end
        end

Then somewhere in code:

        rs1 = MyRecource.new

How can I ensure that **rs1.my\_destroy()** will be called automatically whenever an object **rs1** gets destroyed by Garbage collector?

Hey so I just found out that C#9 is in the makings and I saw this snippet

https://preview.redd.it/gb2bcogj1jt51.png?width=381&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83cd5d43ddbb206eb581e9ca784bbdc1c86d221

Is there any chance I'll get to write ruby like that? (Or is there a way to write code like that that I'm not aware of?)
