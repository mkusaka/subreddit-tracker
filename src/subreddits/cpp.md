**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* 🚨 **Updated Remote section.** 🚨 You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [🚨 **Updated!** 🚨 Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft?

[https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template)

This is an update to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gt0pz1/i_made_a_project_template_for_modern_c_projects/), in which I shared with you [my modern C++ template](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template).

Everyone was kind enough to give me a lot of feedback on how, what and where to improve it and I wish to once more share it with you, with hopes that you will all be satisfied with its current state.

Once more I am asking for you opinions and I hope you find it useful!

## Features
  * Modern **CMake** configuration and project, which, to the best of my knowledge, uses the best practices,
  * An example of a **Clang-Format** config, inspired from the base *Google* model, with minor tweaks. This is aimed only as a starting point, as coding style is a subjective matter, everyone is free to either delete it (for the *LLVM* default) or supply their own alternative,
  * **Static analyzers** integration, with *Clang-Tidy* and *Cppcheck*, the former being the default option,
  * **Doxygen** support, through the `ENABLE_DOXYGEN` option, which you can enable if you wish to use it,
  * **Unit testing** support, through *GoogleTest* (with an option to enable *GoogleMock*) or *Catch2*,
  * **Code coverage**, enabled by using the `ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` option, through *Codecov* CI integration,
  * **Package manager support**, with *Conan* and *Vcpkg*, through their respective options
  * **CI workflows for Windows, Linux and MacOS** using *GitHub Actions*, making use of the caching features, to ensure minimum run time,
  * **.md templates** for: *README*, *Code of Conduct*, *Contributing Guideliness*, *Issues* and *Pull Requests*,
  * **Permissive license** to allow you to integrate it as easily as possible. The template is licensed under the [Boost Software License](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt),
  * Options to build as a header-only library or executable, not just a static or shared library.
  * *CCache* integration, for speeding up build times

Thank you to everyone who has supported me and I am very grateful for all the feedback you provided, as well as the opportunity to learn a lot of new things through it! I hope I am not posting too soon since the original, but I wanted to give everyone interested an updated. Hopefully you all find at least one thing that is useful for you, getting something in return for the long read!

Edit: formatting.

Edit 2: Updated with latest features/changes.

I've been using Python in VS Code lately. Since it's an interpreted language, its Debug Console is very powerful. I also use Visual C++ and I think it would be really cool to have the ability to run arbitrary code on a breakpoint (at least in the debug config). I think this would be a quite big productivity boost for many - you can try different things and immediately see if they give you expected results and the debugging speed improves. Immediate Window in VC++ is very limited. There is Cling but I don't think you could integrate it easily with Clang in an IDE.

Any thoughts?  I'm afraid that it would be too much work to make something like this happen. One way could be to have a Cling IDE and the ability to mark certain parts of code for optimized compiling with Clang, as there are usually not many hotspots in code.
## [8][RStein.AsyncCpp (06-03-2020) - Task Parallel Library](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gvpepb/rsteinasynccpp_06032020_task_parallel_library/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gvpepb/rsteinasynccpp_06032020_task_parallel_library/
---
Original announcement:[https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gd5313/task\_parallel\_library\_tpl\_for\_c\_coroutines\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gd5313/task_parallel_library_tpl_for_c_coroutines_in/)

Changes:

\-Added **AsyncMutex** synchronization primitive.

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#AsyncMutex](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#AsyncMutex)

\- **TaskFactory.Run automatically unwraps nested Task** (e.g. scheduled lambda-coroutine returns Task).  Very convenient and prevents some hard-to-debug, but easy to introduce bugs in C++ coroutines.

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#TaskFactory-Unwrap-Nested-Task](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#TaskFactory-Unwrap-Nested-Task)

\- Task has the **Unwrap method** ((Unwrap Task&lt;Task&lt;T&gt; and returns Task&lt;T&gt;) and corresponding **Fjoin** method.

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#Task-Fjoin](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#Task-Fjoin)

\- Added **SynchronizationContext** \- provides a mechanism to queue work to a specialized context. (useful for marshaling calls to UI thread, event loop, etc.)

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#synchronizationcontext](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#synchronizationcontext)

\- Added **SynchronizationContextScope** \- RAII class for SynchronizationContext. An instance of this class captures the current synchronization context in the constructor (now 'old' context), installs new synchronization context provided by the user, and restores 'old' synchronization context in the destructor.)

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#SynchronizationContextScope](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#SynchronizationContextScope)

\- Added **ConfigureAwait** method (for the Task awaiter) - configures if the 'co\_await continuation' is resumed in the specific synchronization context.

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#ConfigureAwait](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#ConfigureAwait)

\- Added **GlobalTaskSettings::UseOnlyConfigureAwaitFalseBehavior** configuration key - set the key to true if you want to enforce the equivalent of the 'co\_await someTask.ConfigureAwait(false)' for all 'co\_await someTask{anything}' expressions in the application - synchronization context is then never used when resuming the 'co\_await continuation'.

[https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#GlobalTaskSettings-UseOnlyConfigureAwaitFalseBehavior](https://github.com/renestein/Rstein.AsyncCpp#GlobalTaskSettings-UseOnlyConfigureAwaitFalseBehavior)

\- **Task.ContinueWith method** has new overloads with CancellationToken argument.

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/guqthy/i_wrote_a_cpuemulator_using_only_the_c_type_system/
---
Due to the Turing completeness of the C++ type system it is possible to implement a complete CPU emulator using only templates. The complete code is executed during compilation, the only run time code is for printing the output and registers.

[https://github.com/aul12/TemplateCpu](https://github.com/aul12/TemplateCpu)

At the moment not many instructions are supported, but new instructions can be added easily. With the current state it is already possible to calculate the n-th fibonacci number, both iterative and recursive.

Use case:

    vector&lt;string&gt; names = {"Not empty"};
    auto const all_empty = all_of(begin(names), end(names), &amp;string::empty);

I looked through a few invoke-related papers (N4169, P0077R2... any others?) to see if relaxing the algorithm requirements was considered or discussed but I couldn't find any mention of the idea. Is it  because it's dumb in some way? If so please clue me in :).
