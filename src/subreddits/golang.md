Why are most of the question posts down voted? I'm new to the community and I notice the trend that any post that asks a question, even legitimate and good, is down voted.

I see a lot of them at 0 votes and a few at - 1 or - 2. Is there a bot that's down voting them? Are there a handful of people who are doing it?

Normally I wouldn't really think anything of it, but it seems like it's every one. Not flaming the community, just asking from the perspective of an outsider if there's some rules or guidelines about how to ask questions or what questions to ask. I'd appreciate anyone who could help me (and probably several others) understand how to be relevant in your reddit community.

If it's a bot, or a handful of people, that's fine. Haters gonna hate. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something.

Is there a reason Go doesn't have a standard implementation for an ordered map (similar to a C++ `map`, which I believe is implemented as a red-black tree)? I would think it's a common enough data structure to warrant this. Or is there something about the Go language or design philosophy that goes against this? I've just started learning Go, so I'm sorry if this is a dumb question.

Created a [client](https://github.com/svetlyi/gdriveapp) for Google Drive and I'd like to hear some advice on how to improve it and especially how to mock API calls like AboutGetCall and cover it with tests. Because things like AboutGetCall use recursive calls and it is [not possible](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/1074) to use interfaces to mock them.

Hello,

I created [this](https://github.com/gohp/) org as a collection of the best high-performance packages. I would like to hear suggestions of packages not present in the org, tags for the repos, etc...

Thanks.

I've been writing reliability layers on top of unreliable network transport protocols like UDP and decided to write tests and open-source a key portion of it into a Go module: sequence buffers.

[https://github.com/lithdew/seq](https://github.com/lithdew/seq)

For a good description of the data structure, check it out here in the context of building a reliable UDP protocol for games: [https://gafferongames.com/post/reliable\_ordered\_messages/](https://gafferongames.com/post/reliable_ordered_messages/)
