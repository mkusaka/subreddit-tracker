Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

CliWidget is a library written in C++ with the idea of help programmers to build "user interfaces" in the terminal, with the use of simple Widgets.

The Github of the project is in this repository: [https://github.com/lazaro92/CliWidget](https://github.com/lazaro92/CliWidget)

This is the second version of the library, the first one was the release under Linux systems and now I have released for Windows systems, using CMake and compiling parts of the source code depending on the OS (using preprocessor directives like [these](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/142508/how-do-i-check-os-with-a-preprocessor-directive)).

What do you think about the library?

I picked C++ as my first language because I want to get into a video game company. It was difficult at first, but it gets easier over time, but still, hard nonetheless.

But then, something happened that force me to stay in my hometown until I die probably.

So, the ways for me to earn money from programming now are: create my own software/app/game, freelancing, or remote job.

Everybody wants to have a successful software that they can sell it for a stockpile of $$, but I'm going to go with the realistic view here and aim for the freelancing and remote job.

My question is, is C++ is a great language for me if I'm going to be a freelance and remote job? Or should I focus on another language? I'm still going to learn C++ though. I fell in love with it. I just going to assign more of my time to the new language and make C++ become my second language.

Now, a little background of me. I'm 20 years old boy from a third world country living in a very very small city that I think about 50% still using a non-smartphone as their phone and there's absolutely no company that engaged in technology. Most people either work as a farmer, livestock breeder, and things like that.

Don't get me wrong, I love my hometown. It is so peaceful here. I always said that my hometown is a perfect city for retirement.

But, that's the thing. I'm not planning for retirement, I'm still trying to get some money.

Also, I will not attend college. Well, "can't" is the more proper word here.

So yeah, any advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much

EDIT: I forgot to tell you that it's been only 2 months since I learn C++. I could make a number guess, tic tac toe, and dungeon crawler with object-oriented programming.

Also, I'm not asking for a way to earn fast money. I don't mind just keep learning for a year, or two, or three, or four. I just need to know is C++ is a good language for me in the long run

[P1293](https://wg21.link/p1293) ostream_joiner paper will not be further pursued.  
https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/64  
  
The paper proposes to add the ostream_joiner.  
Which would make the following possible  
`vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 4, 6};`  
`copy(v.begin(), v.end(), ostream_joiner(cout, ", "));`  
Which prints "1, 4, 6"  
Without trailing comma, as ostream_iterator would do.  
  
I still think this would be a nice addition to the language.  
What do you think? Should it be further pursued?  
  
LEWG had asked to look at how concepts/ranges would impact the design.  
Ideas how concepts/ranges could impact or improve the design?  
  
Or could a format addition be used to achieve a similar result?

What do you think about a Standard proposal for a new literal suffix of a std::integral\_constant instance?

    constexpr auto x=123ic; // same as `constexpr std::integral_constant&lt;int, 123&gt; x`;
    // maybe:
    constexpr auto str="some character literal"ic;
