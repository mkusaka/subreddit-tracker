I am wondering if I can do that and if the Context API and the Reducer Hook are better than Redux.

Hey all ‚Äî I just started learning Amplify and it's been great, however there is a lot of information to digest, tools to review and documentation to go through. So I was looking to reddit for some advice on an application I am trying to build and what tools you think would work best. In addition I'm pretty strictly a frontend dev, but trying to learn more backend stuff.

Requirements for my web app:

1. User login/signup + social auth **(Currently using Amplify Auth to do this)**
2. Add users to a group in which they would share a dashboard ‚Äî potentially different permissions **(Thinking I could store this in Cognito ‚Äî or would I need to store in a DB)**
3. A way for the user who initially created the group to invite others to the group via email
4. User forms and a place to store the data
5. Basic user polls like ([doodle](https://doodle.com/) or [survey monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)) that is only available to the group
6. Fetch data from other sites (like a wish list type of deal), in which I'll gather the images/data to show in a list ‚Äî like [wish list](https://www.wishlist.com/) does.

Currently Using:

1. AWS Amplify with auth and API(which I'm not using yet)
2. React
3. Material UI

My main questions:

1. Should I use a graphql or REST API?
2. Should I use DynamoDB?
3. What does it mean when you add **hosting** to amplify? I don't really understand what that will add.

I originally created a basic version of this app to scratch my own itch and keep track of web dev subreddits at work without the ads and other distractions on Reddit.

The site has recently gone through a big change to help user engagement and use of the site.

When you land on the site you will have the r/all subs in your feed, you can then add and remove subs as you want and this updates the feed.

I have worked on making a very basic version of this and then requesting features, suggestions and things to add to help remove some pain points people may have with the web version of Reddit.

I welcome your feedback and happy to answer any questions.

## [9][Publishing react components: use webpack or Babel or none of it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f0pjly/publishing_react_components_use_webpack_or_babel/)

I want to reuse a react component (with jsx) in another npm package. I'm wondering how this is best done:
1. Don't do any transformations in the source package and reference the jsx directly. Transpile the referenced jsx in the consuming package. (This won't work if the Babel loader excludes everything in node_modules directory.)
2. Transpile and package the jsx files with webpack. One entry per jsx file. Reference the resulting files, which now include all the needed dependencies. The consuming package now only sees es5 code, and can use webpack to bundle everything, including the (now plain vanilla js) react component.
3. Transpile the jsx files with Babel to a separate directory. The consuming package now only sees es5 code but without dependencies, and can use webpack to bundle everything, including the (now plain vanilla js) react component.

I think (2) or (3) is the way to go. I've tried (1), but doesn't seem a good idea to make the consuming package responsible to transpile the react components (it might not even use react itself). (3) seems the cleanest (haven't got it working though), but I've seen most people do (2).

What are the the pros and cons of each option? Are there other alternatives? How do you make this work?

Have you wondered since hooks were introduced, the way we write React changed considerably. Here, give an overview of how React libraries have been switching to React hooks resulting in a cleaner and better code on our applications: [https://www.herodev.io/blog/react-libraries-switching-to-hooks](https://www.herodev.io/blog/react-libraries-switching-to-hooks)

## [12][React Hooks - state variables in DOM elements](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f0obq2/react_hooks_state_variables_in_dom_elements/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f0obq2/react_hooks_state_variables_in_dom_elements/

Hello,

I have started to play with React hooks. I found that when I map over an array of objects and use the count variable it is localized to each individual DOM element. I am curious why this is. I was assuming the variable would be the same across all DOM elements.

&amp;#x200B;

function Dropdown() {  
 const \[count, setCount\] = useState(0);  
 return(  
 &lt;DropdownContainer&gt;

{data.map((item) =&gt; (  
&lt;DropdownItem *onClick*={() =&gt; setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount + 1)}&gt;

{item.text} {count}   
&lt;/DropdownItem&gt;  
))}  
 &lt;/DropdownContainer&gt;  
)  
}
