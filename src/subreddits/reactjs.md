## Want Help with your Code?

1. **Improve your chances** by adding a minimal example with [JSFiddle][jsfiddle], [CodeSandbox][code sandbox], or [Stackblitz][stackblitz].
    - Describe what you want it to do, and things you've tried. Don't just post big blocks of code!
    - **[Formatting Code][wiki formatting code]** wiki shows how to format code in this thread.
1. **Pay it forward!** Answer questions even if there is already an answer. Other perspectives can be helpful to beginners. Also, there's no quicker way to learn than [being wrong on the Internet][being wrong on the internet].

We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I have tried to write down few methods i used to achieve improved performance to my react application.

## [5][Top component API call vs child component API call?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ibate2/top_component_api_call_vs_child_component_api_call/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ibate2/top_component_api_call_vs_child_component_api_call/
---
Hello, I've been wondering for the past days what would be the pros and cons of top vs child component API call.

What I mean by that is, would it be better to have a gigantic call on a page component that gets all the data which will be feed to the child components, or have more fragmented call within the childs that only get the required data for said child?

The first one seems to me more performant as it makes way less call to the API, but if an error occurs it's on the whole page, whereas fragmented API call might be less performant but this make the child more independent and if error occurs it can be on a localized child only and the others would still work.

What are your thoughts on this?

Officially just published my VSCode theme which is strongly inspired by [Dan Abramov's Overreacted blog](https://overreacted.io/) color scheme, itself based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) syntax theme.

It should be completely compatible with React, TypeScript and all Node.js frameworks. I worked pretty hard on it and I'll keep updating it so I would love to have your feedbacks!

You can try it here: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mubartok.minuit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mubartok.minuit)

If you want to show your ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è you can star the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/mubartok/minuit-vscode-theme)

Just curious as to what people's journey was first getting into React, and how you then convinced people to pay you to do it.

FYI not looking for advice (though feel free to share any), I'm fortunate enough to be employed. Just want to hear how other people did it; maybe others can benefit from hearing it!
