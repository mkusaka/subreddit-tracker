We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I just recently started looking into TypeScript out of curiosity. I started a test project, and everything seemed to work the same using Create React App (automatic recompilation, etc.).

Given that I don't have to manually compile anything, is there any disadvantage to using TypeScript with React? Even if I just write straight JavaScript without explicitly declaring types or using other features, it still does type checking on inferred types.

It's just that I haven't seen a lot of people using it, and I was wondering if there's a reason I might not want to. I've only played around with it a little bit. Is there maybe a noticeable increase in compilation time as a project grows or something else I should be aware of that might bite me in the ass later?

When COVID-19 hit, I decided to quit my day job and found a startup. Pretty daunting, but you never know what you can do until you actually start.

[ViTeach](https://www.viteach.de/?ac_src=reddit) is an app that sets out to make math tutoring much more financially accessible to all students (especially students from weaker socio-economic backgrounds) and thus making sure that no student is left behind! The idea is to replace traditional math tutoring with a machine learning-based intelligent virtual tutor (we call her VI). Long way to go, but small steps!

[Student Demo](https://reddit.com/link/izh5t5/video/y8hc1patu9p51/player)

The app was initially built with "create-react-app", but we have since transitioned to "next.js". The app is entirely free at this point and will stay so for the foreseeable future.

**The stack involves:**

\- MongoDb

\- Node.js/Express.js

\- Passport.js (for authentication)

\- Google Pub/Sub

\- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (for realtime chat)

\- **react.js** for the entire frontend

\- Python (leveraging the serverless framework) **auto-response generation**, custom tracking, data collection

More than happy to discuss any of the components and lend a helping hand where I can.

**First successes:**

\- we are already working with a few schools (very happy about that)

\- first online marketing and SEO successes.

\- amazing student feedback

Check it out and let me know what you think!

Cheers

EDIT: Posted on stackoverflow if you want some points there [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64064811/hook-error-in-route-container-component-using-useparams](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64064811/hook-error-in-route-container-component-using-useparams)

I am using a route like this:

`&lt;Route path={"/:userType/banks/:bank"} component={&lt;BankContainer/&gt;}/&gt;`

The Bank component is a redux container component. Inside I have a conditional render based off the user type.

`const BankContainer = (props) =&gt; {`

`const { userType } = useParams();`

`return (`

`userType === "admin" ? &lt;Bank/&gt; : &lt;CustomerBank/&gt;`

`)`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

I get a react warning and then a react error

Warning I got:

`Warning: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by ConnectFunction. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed. For more information, read the Rules of Hooks`

`Previous render Next render`

`in Provider (at src/index.js:68)`

&amp;#x200B;

Error I got:

`Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:`

`1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)`

`2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks`

`3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app`

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

my package.json versions:

`"react-redux": "^7.2.0",`

`"react-router-dom": "5.2.0",`

`"react": "16.13.1",`

`"react-dom": "16.13.1",`

&amp;#x200B;

Thing's I've tried:

1. Checked for react bundler issues
2. Switched to view rather than just a react container
3. Tried other hooks, still same issue
