This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I'm aware that google is promoting the use of Android Studio and Kotlin for android app development. But at the same time they promote Flutter and Dart for app development.

Since apps based on flutter can run both on android and ios, it seems like a better choice. Why is google pushing both?

Sorry I'm a noob.

Android Fragment Lifecycle is complicated, and official documentation is even worse. But don’t panic, there is an easy way to understand and use it correctly. It’ll take you 137 seconds, start your timer.

## [8][Is kotlin treated as pure native language in android or does it get translated or converted to java?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ht0mdy/is_kotlin_treated_as_pure_native_language_in/)

Hi, I am very new in android programming. Seeing some posts in this subs about kotlin intrigue me to try to move away from Android Java to kotlin since android still stuck with the old java 8. 

Like the question in the title, is kotlin treated as native or will it be translated to java during compile or running? Does android has two VMs ( Java and Kotlin)? Will there be performance impact to move to kotlin? Like speed and file size?

I am using features such as webview from javafx that is available only in Java 8 for android. Now java has gone to Java 14, but android atill stuck with java 8. This stresses me out since we also integrate some APIs that uses later version of Java.

Any infos are very appreciated.

Hello everyone, 

I'm trying to get into app development, with a background in python. I know Java is what's primarily used, but there are packages for python (e.g. Kivy), that enable you to design GUIs and various functions. However, I have yet to find something for automated web browsing (like selenium). I know  you can use WebView for this, but that is in Java/Kotlin. I'm looking for something within Python.   


The app would take a user input, and then input that information into an online site (e.g. input logic information in the app, and it opens up a chrome browser, goes to [facebook.com](https://facebook.com), enters the inputs, click login button to log you in. Or input something in the app, chrome opens up and goes to google.com , and searches the entry). I've been able to successfully design a GUI using Kivy, and compile it into apk using buildozer, and I've tested this apk both on my own phone, and the emulator. However, I have yet to find any tools that I can write in python, for automated web browsing. 

Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated!
