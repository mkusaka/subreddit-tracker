Hi redditors and JavaScript lovers!  


We've been developing our Vuestic Admin for 3 years already, it started from a small admin template and now evolving into our own components framework.  


Our 2019 redesign separated Vuestic users. Majority really loved it's fresh look, but for some people it seemed to be too 'acid'. So we decided to craft an alternative and finally launched corporate white theme today.  


Right now we're puzzled: we love the original look but new white color scheme looks somehow calmer and neater. We're thinking of making white color scheme default both for Vuestic Admin and Vuestic UI (our own components framework which is currently under development) but not sure completely.  


Your opinions and feedback would really help us. Here's the link for you to check [https://github.com/epicmaxco/vuestic-admin](https://github.com/epicmaxco/vuestic-admin), thank you!
