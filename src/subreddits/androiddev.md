Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

 [https://github.com/mitchtabian/DaggerMultiFeature](https://github.com/mitchtabian/DaggerMultiFeature) 

I made this sample as a learning tool for understanding how to build a multi-feature project with the topics mentioned in the title. Hopefully it helps some of you if you're trying to do the same.

Each feature has it's own Subcomponent with it's own:

1. Scope
2. ViewModelFactory
3. FragmentFactory
4. NavHostFragment
   1. These are added programmatically in the activity

**Note**: This is plan-old dagger2. No dagger-android.

// TODO

Work on a dynamic multi-feature sample.

Hi! I'm a sleep scientist currently in the stage of developing a working, accurate sleep analysis and cycling app. 
As a consumer, what would you want out of the app?
Already in the works is obviously sleep analysis (the method is still debated) and snoring recording traces.

Thanks!
