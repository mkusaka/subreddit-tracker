**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

TimeTracker: A simple C++ 11 header only library for measuring the execution time of your code block using chrono steady\_clock. 

It will also calculate the minimum, maximum and average execution time in a given period, which is called report interval. Every report interval, TimeTracker can generate formatted strings for later usage, or TimeTrack can print the report to standard output.

[https://github.com/MoserMichael/cppcombinator](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cppcombinator)  

Please  check out my side project, it's a  library for building PEG parsers  (top-down parser) that build an  in-memory parse tree, Each template  instantiation stands for a grammar  rule, and translates directly into a  node in the parse tree. In this  respect this project differs from  PEGTL. The project taught me a lot  about C++ metaprogramming.

BTW:  I am also looking for a job right now.  I do C++, Golang, Python and  Java on Linux. Looking for remote job as  contractor or full time  (on-site in Israel). I have worked with  kubernetes, storage,  networking, security.

## [11][Patch for GCC 10 to implement P0222](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hqbqjd/patch_for_gcc_10_to_implement_p0222/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hqbqjd/patch_for_gcc_10_to_implement_p0222/

P0222: [https://github.com/mwoehlke/cpp-proposals/blob/master/p0222r0-anonymous-struct-return.rst](https://github.com/mwoehlke/cpp-proposals/blob/master/p0222r0-anonymous-struct-return.rst)

GCC: [https://gcc.gnu.org/git.html](https://gcc.gnu.org/git.html)

This patch lifts the restriction described in P0222 + it is possible to define types in function arguments, so it's possible to write code like this:

    struct { int x; }
    g(const struct { int y; } &amp;args) {
    	return { .x = args.y };
    }
    
    int main() {
    	return g({ .y = 11 }).x;
    }

This code generates the following assembly with `-O3`:

    movl    $11, %eax
    ret

Patch:

Patch is trivial and even if it does not apply, it should be possible to replicate it on other versions of GCC.

IMO it is a bit of overkill because it allows to write code like this:

    struct {
    	int x = 0;
    
    	operator int () const {
    		// this executes when struct is converted to int but not before that
    		std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    	struct tors {
    		tors() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "got ctor" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }
    		~tors() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "got dtor?" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }
    	} tors = {};
    }
    f(const struct { int y; } &amp;args) {
    	return { .x = args.y };
    }

This isn't exactly footgun, more like a tactical nuke, looks funny, but probably under export restrictions. But this is very powerful and could be a solid basis for more refined language features i think. However if you think about it, this is nothing that can not be implemented with non anonymous structures. For designated initializers `-std=c++2a` is need to be set of course.

Any ideas?
