Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

We’re on the engineering team for Android Jetpack &amp; Jetpack Compose, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, August 27**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), focusing on a new topic every week. We’re excited to close out our [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid) with a focus on UI, and on Thursday we’ll be hosting an AMA on the Android Jetpack and Jetpack Compose!

[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is our suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We launched several new libraries like Hilt for Dependency Injection, App Startup, and updates to Paging, Navigation, CameraX, and more.  Check out the Jetpack updates we made during #11WeeksOfAndroid [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-jetpack.html).

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI - declarative, composable, and more! We just [launched](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/announcing-jetpack-compose-alpha.html) alpha, together with a bunch of new  training materials! Check out our new videos, or dive into our curated [pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose). We are excited to hear your feedback as you try it!

For this AMA, we want to answer your *technical* questions about Android Jetpack and Compose.  No roadmaps :)

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, August 27 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PDT / 4:20 PM EDT.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

**Here are some topics we’re looking forward to talking about, but feel free to ask anything!**

* Jetpack Compose
* Hilt
* Navigation
* WorkManager
* Paging

It seems Google loves to give us alpha and beta versions of various androidx libraries. At first I figured they were for bleeding edge development and not meant for use in production apps, but I've come to realize that's not the case.

Take ConstraintLayout for example. The newly release stable 2.0.0 include fixes related to RecyclerView and the documentation for 2.0.0 RC01 specially states: "RecyclerView fixes (we recommend to update to recyclerview 1.2.0 alpha 5 or later)". Hence they recommend you use an alpha version of RecyclerView with the latest stable version of ConstraintLayout. 

Maybe I'm just old fashined, but I'm generally hesitant to use an alpha version of anything in a production environment. Yet I'm currently using recyclerview:1.2.0-alpha05 and material:1.3.0-alpha01 in one of my apps on Google Play.

Am I missing something here or is this just how Google wants to play it?
## [9][Naming convention for XML View ID's?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ii563p/naming_convention_for_xml_view_ids/)

This is like a weird question, but I recently started with Kotlin and Android extensions. Before this, all my projects had a naming convention that I used to make findViewById calls easier.

Before, I'd make it like this: If it was Signup MaterialButton in ActivityMain.xml, I'd give it ID as `am_mb_signup` (Initials of ActivityMain\_MaterialButton\_Signup). So it was easier making findViewByID calls for me that way.

Now that I can directly reference ID's without those calls, I wanted to know what naming conventions others use (if any) for ID's?

I'm a React developer diving into Android. It seems to me like Activities are basically React Container components and Fragments are React Presentional components (SmartComponents pattern).

I'm working on an app that has multiple "minigames" we'll call them. There is always a minigame on screen, and the games have many options that exist in a slide up tray. The tray's contents changes depending on the current minigame and also includes the main menu.

What I want here is a single Activity that shows two Fragments - the game, and the content part of the slidey tray, that both contextually change, right?

Each minigame seems like it should logically have it's own Activity though since they're unrelated to each other. Can I make them Activities but dynamically load them without moving to a new screen visually?
## [12][Jetpack Compose Basics - Lesson 2 - Add a picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ii1sc8/jetpack_compose_basics_lesson_2_add_a_picture/)

Trying to follow the original tutorial but I am stuck at [**Lesson 2**](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial) **- add a picture** step.

I pasted the NewsStory composable code to my project, but as soon as I try to apply `preferredHeightIn(maxHeight = 180.dp)`  modifier to the Image the application crashes on startup with the following exception:  
**java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: maxHeight(656) must be &gt;= minHeight(747)**

I do not specify max and min height explicitly (just following the tutorial), and if I increase the value to like 500.dp it works.

Getting the same exception with different calculated pixel values on different device sizes.

Does anyone experience the same issue?
