This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [5][Published App(Google Play) does not appear on Google Play Store for 36+ hours, Please Help](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jntirr/published_appgoogle_play_does_not_appear_on/)

I published an app 2days ago and it will not appear on the Google Play Store.

I'm not talking about search results. The URL Google Play Console officially gives me opens a page that saids "We're sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server". I've published a few apps before, all were up and running after 3\~12 hours and people told me that it would certainly appear after 24 hours. I waited for 36 hours cause these days there's a notice from google that COVID-19 issues are making them spend more time than usual.

More information:  
\- Release State is "Published" in my console- Release Country is all set.  
\- The version I published was tested Internally and Closed Beta.  
\- Same version(and URL) shows up when I'm logged in to my browser  
  (because I am an internal tester)  
\- People told me to check app id/package name matching the [URL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wayway.projectt),  
  checked It and it matches the URL.  
\- I made an [inquiry](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/publishing?extra.IssueType=missing) to Google Dev Services,   
  they are telling me it might take 2 days to get back to me.

Anyone having same issues?

Hi! 
Today I noticed that my gmail account attached with my google play console has tons of mails of users asking for a refund. They say that they accidentally purchased my app and can not get a refund.I noticed that almost all mails are same but from different accounts and almost all users are indian.

Hello guys. I am developing app that loads user profile pictures from Facebook. It’s all working fine, but sometimes images take long to show. A lot of images that are shown are from the same user in different places and every time when it needs to be displayed it must be downloaded again. I was curious if there is a way for this to be faster. Is it possible to cache userId : image pair somewhere? If it’s possible do I break any Facebook rule by saving profile picture ?

I'm an Android developer, but I used to solve coding problems on Leetcode with Java, but recently I have switched to Kotlin. I learned something during this process and decided to share it with you. It might be not about Android, but having those things in mind when writing Android code might be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you practice solving coding problems on Leetcode, Codeforces or maybe you participate in JetBrains' Kotlin Heroes programming contest?
