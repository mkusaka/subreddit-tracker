Hi guys,

Today I'd like to show you [Avo](https://avohq.io), a beautiful next-generation framework that empowers you, the developer, to create fantastic admin panels for your Ruby on Rails apps with the flexibility to fit your needs as you grow.

Out of the box, it has an excellent CRUD interface, ordering, filters, and actions. It even knows how to handle your Active Record model relations. 

It's super easy to configure. There's one configuration file per model and one configuration line of code per field. You can add simple fields like text, textarea, dropdowns, and more complex ones like datetime, badges, loaders, currency, and others. There's even a cool one-liner single or multi-file Active Storage integration ðŸ¤¯. 

**Avo's mission is to make the job of developers easier and help them and companies move faster.**

Try it in your app and let me know what you think.

Thank you,  
Adrian

I guess this exact tutorial topic is already a "mauvais ton", but after reading 10+ guides on "How to install bootstrap on Rails 6" I wrote a quick guide: [https://blog.corsego.com/2020/10/rails-6-with-bootstrap-and-webpacker.html](https://blog.corsego.com/2020/10/rails-6-with-bootstrap-and-webpacker.html)

## [7][How to significantly archive and compress a given tmp Rails directory contents?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jc47cr/how_to_significantly_archive_and_compress_a_given/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jc47cr/how_to_significantly_archive_and_compress_a_given/

My workflow is as follows:

1. User requests to have the system send many PDF files (in the hundreds) to a given email address. I use Sidekiq to handle this job.
2. I generate these pdf documents and save them to a random-named directory in tmp folder (eg. tmp/pdfs/2e3b8f6f-81e6-40b1-9cdc-d1bb0a0ee519/)
3. I use the gem RubyZip and the example given to zip the `tmp/pdfs/2e3b8f6f-81e6-40b1-9cdc-d1bb0a0ee519/` directory into a zip file (eg. [thefiles.zip](https://thefiles.zip))
4. I send [thefiles.zip](https://thefiles.zip) to the user via email.

Problem: RubyZip does not significantly compress this archive. If I request that 24 PDF files equaling 12 MB be archived, the archive is 10MB for eg.

How can I do this?

Hi there, I want to have two different types of users (buyers, sellers) on my application. Should I create two types of users using devise to accomplish this? Or is there a more streamlined approach?

O.k. so I finally got a rails server to load with Rails 5.0.0 and ruby 2.5.8 (I'm upgrading from ruby 2.2.4 and rails 4.2.0).

I don't have any sll issues.

I'm now at the "ActiveRecord::PendingMigrationError" level.

Basically I haven't created the tables in my db (the db is already created in postgres).

When I run the bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development I get the following:

&gt;PG::DatatypeMismatch: ERROR:  column "root_comment" is of type boolean but default expression is of type integer
&gt;HINT:  You will need to rewrite or cast the expression.

I've read a ton, and it seems rails 5 changed both migration scripts and how to define columns in postgres.

Do I need to label my migration script with something like [4.2 or 5.0] or do I actually need to change the type (further screwing up my app)?

Thanks in advance.
## [11][Modal age confirmation? Or just a view for it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jbtypu/modal_age_confirmation_or_just_a_view_for_it/)

Hi folks. I'm making a web app for my web dev portfolio and it has to do with the cannabis industry. So I'd like to add an age confirmation to the landing page. I was thinking it could just be a modal that pops up and just asks if you're 21 or over, or has you enter your DOB, and then lets you continue to the site and browse through it even if you're not logged in. Or should there just be a view dedicated to that? Either way it'll need a controller, right? 

Would this be a practical way in Rails to do this? The landing page will just have the log in or sign up links in the nav, and then there's an "enter" button in the middle of the page that would then prompt that modal. I'm just looking for advice or to be pointed in the right direction as I'm honestly not finding much in my research that would help me with this exact issue. A lot of what's coming up is deletion confirmation modals, or some other things that don't exactly help me. 

I'm still very new to Rails. I only just graduated boot camp a while ago so I'm building little apps for my portfolio and gaining that experience. Any help would be appreciated!

Hi guys, in my website now I have only two roles. User &amp; Staff.

But Staff is not a "real" role. In the DB I can set Staff true/false.

Now I want to improve my website and add 5 kind of rules: User, Verified User, Banned User, Mod and Staff.

Tecnically I can set their "power" in the `app/policies` area (using, for example  `user.try(:mod?)` )

A developer suggested me to use CanCanCan and rolify.

Is it really necessary? Just to add 4 roles? I don't want to add gems just to add one or two features...

p.s. I already use devise
