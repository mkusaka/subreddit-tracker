**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.

* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

## [3][Explicit Parameters: A proposal for extending the meaning of the 'explicit' keyword](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/genb18/explicit_parameters_a_proposal_for_extending_the/)

Hello folks,

One of the things I love about the standardization process in C++ is how inclusive it can be. Many of us don't have influence in the community, but are passionate about C++, and can follow â€“ and even join! â€“ the process and learn a lot with smarter, more experienced people.

So I've been working on a paper and would like your feedback to decide whether it's worth submitting it to the Committee. 

I searched for past proposals on this issue, and couldn't find anything related. Hopefully I'm not just proposing something discarded years ago.

**The Problem:** Implicit Conversions

We know their pitfalls, we know why we have them, and sadly we also know we can't straight-up fix them by making everything explicit by default. Except, maybe, by introducing Epochs, but that might be a more controversial topic.

The language allows us to fix most of implicit conversion problems by using the keyword `explicit` on our constructors and conversion operators:

    struct ExplicitIntWrapper {
        explicit ExplicitIntWrapper(int);
        explicit operator int();
    };

However, one of the issues we still have is implicit conversions between fundamental types.

    int sqr(int x);
    auto x = sqr(3.16); // Desired result only if an overload exists
    auto y = sqr('Y');  // Y?!

**The Proposal**

Allow the `explicit` keyword in function parameters, e.g.:

    int sqr(explicit int x);
    auto x = sqr(3.16); // Error if an overload does not exist
    auto y = sqr('Y');  // Error.

In short, it'd be an idiomatic way to express this constraint, being used everywhere you'd today be required to use SFINAE with `std::enable_if_t&lt;std::is_same_v&lt;T, U&gt;&gt;`, or `std::same_as&lt;T&gt; auto` tomorrow (C++20).

This approach is supposed to have advantages over using templates to constrain the arguments, such as not requiring template instantiations, and allowing library maintainers to make their code safer while keeping ABI stability.

Additionally, I also included the use of `explicit` in NTTPs, to guarantee compatibility with P1045.

**The Paper [(link)](https://gist.github.com/JoelFilho/f86eb49569e0a961c26a5d3b7c5e4f61)**

The current draft for the paper [is on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/JoelFilho/f86eb49569e0a961c26a5d3b7c5e4f61).

Any feedback would be highly welcomed. As I've never participated in the standardization process, some fundamental issues might not be obvious to me.

I've also had some feedback from the Cpplang Slack community, and one concern raised is that, as a language feature, it might be too much work on the standardization process for too little effect on most codebases. I'd also appreciate your opinion on that.

Also, mandatory _English is not my first language_, so if you spot an error, please also let me know. Sometimes grammar errors happen because they make perfect sense in our native language, and we end up not realizing until pointed out.

As a long time open source contributor I've had to deal with a variety of both home grown and cloud based continuous integration platforms. Recently I was, again, debugging why a particular build of [B2](https://boostorg.github.io/build/) on a particular cloud CI service was failing. The particular reason why is not important. But what's important is that it's not always clear where the fault lies. Is it something in your code? Is it something in the compiler? Is it something in the cloud CI service itself? Hence I began a project to isolate the cloud CI setup by itself.. [CI Playground](https://github.com/bfgroup/ci_playground)

It's now become a way to "normalize" simple templates for building C++ on a variety of cloud CI providers, compilers, and operating systems.

Hey there, I'm starting a computer science degree from Athabasca (an online university) and doing a C++ course.  

The text that they use assumes you've done C before, which I haven't, and I'm finding I'm quite lost in the 3rd unit of the course, which is about strings and vectors.   One of the projects is to write a program that counts the occurrence of a specific word in a file which I'm pretty lost at.  

So I've tried to read about C++ on Learn C++, Geeks for Geeks and did all the lessons on W3Schools but it doesn't seems to teach me anything on vectors and the stuff that the text uses.  The text is "Thinking in C++" by Bruce Eckel.  

Anyone have any suggestions for sites which will really make your learn how to program in C++ and get a basic understanding so I an do the course ?  I've thought about Udemy, but I've already paid for the Athabasca course so I don't really want to pay for another one.

I know you. You've been coding C++ for a while now and have your tricks for how to make C++ run faster. I want to know your secrets to speed like tricks like C-style/C++ input reading desynchronization to make reading input faster. That's really the only one I know.

Hi, we are a group of Software Engineering students at ULPGC, and we are doing a small study about possible aspects to improve in C++ IDE's (development environments). We are looking for real C++ programmers to get real opinions and what the developers think. Thank you for your time and sincerity!

## [12][IDE providing autocompletion without a compilation database](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/geeyu8/ide_providing_autocompletion_without_a/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/geeyu8/ide_providing_autocompletion_without_a/
---
I often write code that uses non-standard C++ headers that are on my distro's PATH - implying that if I compiled the code it would execute perfectly. But, none of the editors/IDEs I use (vim, CLion, etc) properly highlight or provide autocompletions for the code provided by those header files - probably because I am not providing a compilation database. 

I do not want to setup a CMake build to generate a compilation database for one-off scripts. 

Are there any IDEs providing linting and autocompletions for header files on the PATH without having to provide a manually built compilation database?
