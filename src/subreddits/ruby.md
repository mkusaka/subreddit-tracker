I was under the impression that switch statements were faster than, or at least as fast as if statements, yet when I did a benchmark the if statement was 15-20% faster. Just trying to learn when it's appropriate to use switch statements, if it has some quirks that slow it down or something.

I've been looking for a new language to use on side-projects, and I recently watched a few conference talks about Ruby, and I'm really impressed with the ergonomics of the language. I was thinking about learning the language, but I was wondering what the community and ecosystem looks like these days. I know that Ruby has fallen away a bit in the "new hotness" sphere, but I'm hoping that this is due to stability and that I'll be able to pick up a language that has staying power.

I come to present a tool that I have developed with 2 others developers [https://github.com/OpenGems/redis\_web\_manager](https://github.com/OpenGems/redis_web_manager)

This  tool allows you to manage Redis, thanks to a web interface you  can  easily manage your Redis instance (see your keys, the memory used,   clients connected, etc â€¦).

Enjoy !

Hi! Learning Ruby since a few months and built this scraper for learning purposes. I want to add it to a rails app and deploy on heroku later. Would that be possible?

See here the github [https://github.com/sljmn/bol\_scraper](https://github.com/sljmn/bol_scraper) and demo in readme. Any feedback on my code?

With this scraper you can find the inventory for a certain product, based on ean.
