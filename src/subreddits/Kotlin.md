We’ll be joined by other developers and team leads from Kotlin, as well as two special guests: Wojtek Kaliciński /u/wkalicinski from Google and Sebastien Deleuze /u/sdeleuze from Spring.

On October 12–15 we hosted the Kotlin 1.4 Online Event, and over the course of those four days we received many interesting questions. Since we did not manage to cover all of them due to time constraints, we will answer them in a specific thread under this post.

Please post your questions as top-level comments to this post.

We look forward to hearing from you!

I've been reading up on Kotlin 1.4, with lots of great stuff (Especially SAM conversions!)

What I can't get my head around though is `PropertyDelegateProvider`. I can't quite work out how it's meant to be used, and I can't find *any* examples of it actually being used in a way that make sense to me.

Can anyone explain? Or, better yet, provide a simple example of it working? Is it simply just how the delegating to other properties works behind the scenes? Or does it, as I think, allow you to delegate a property to a lambda without needing to create a whole new class to support that?

Cheers

## [9][What do you think of this little extension function?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jjmgb0/what_do_you_think_of_this_little_extension/)

If you are a fan of chained calls, for example for string manipulation, you are probably sometimes as frustrated as I am because you have to "break the flow". I hit such a case again, but this time I decided to write an extension function so I can comfortably continue the chained call.

I actually don't know if it already exists in some form, but I haven't found it on the first look and it was so little code that it actually doesn't matter. If you actually know that this exists already, let me know.

So, for example let's say you have a filename (taken out of a list, for example) and you want to strip certain file endings (let's just say `.txt`, `.exe` and `.pdf`). But that's not the only thing you want to do. In fact, you already have a chained call with different string manipulations, and as the next step you want to strip the extension if it is one of the mentioned ones. Now the `removeSuffix()` method comes in handy, but the problem is that you don't have a _single_ suffix, but a _collection_ of suffixes. And _for each_ of these suffixes `x`, you need to call `removeSuffix(x)`. Normally this would mean that you have to break your chained call flow from

    string.callA()
        .callB()
        .callC()
        .callD()

To

    var res = string.callA()
        .callB()
        .callC()
        .callD()
    
    extensions.forEach {
        res = res.removeSuffix(it)
    }

Ugly, right? That's why I just patched together the extension function `forEachOf()`. Basically it is called with an arbitrary object as the receiver, but operates a lambda over every element of a given `Iterable`:

    inline fun &lt;T, U&gt; T.forEachOf(other: Iterable&lt;U&gt;, block: T.(U) -&gt; T): T {
        var result = this
        other.forEach {
            result = result.block(it)
        }
        return result
    }

Now I can perform the desired action without breaking the chained call, I can even continue it afterwards:

    string.callA()
        .callB()
        .callC()
        .callD()
        .forEachOf(extensions) { removeSuffix(it) }
        .callE()

Neat, right? Note that the lambda and the `forEachOf()` function (have to) return `T` to 1. be able to continue the chain and 2. deal with immutable classes like `String`.

What do you think? Is it useful? Would you use it? Can you imagine more practical use cases? Or would you improve the extension in some way?

For me it just shows the beauty of the expressiveness and extensibility of Kotlin. A similar problem in Java would be impossible to solve, but with Kotlin you have multiple ways of doing it!
## [10][Using withContext: is it possible to resume execution on the same thread in the same dispatcher?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jjnuji/using_withcontext_is_it_possible_to_resume/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jjnuji/using_withcontext_is_it_possible_to_resume/
---
Imagine a suspend function running on `Dispatchers.Default` similar to this one:

    suspend fun doSomething() {
        pre()
        withContext(myContext) {
            // do some heavy stuff here
            work()
        }
        post()
    }

According to the docs `withContext` will switch to a new thread if a new dispatcher is provided (which is the case here) and resume using the original dispatcher, `Dispatchers.Default`. However, I observe that sometimes it resumes and executes `post()` on a different thread than the one used to execute `pre()`.

This poses a challenge in a problem I need to solve, so I'm wondering whether it is possible to enforce the execution of `post()` and `pre()` on the same thread.

Hey there :) I am kinda new to Kotlin, but not so new to the programing.

I would like to ask for a help. But please... please... only if you  have time and could give me something like a final working code. Those  descriptive answers like: go there and do that.. kinda dont work for me.  Thats the reason why I created this profile... because i am totally  stuck...

So... I would like to have a very very simple (working) example of this: I have a widget. On that widget i have a button with id "buttonASD" and i have textview with id "textviewASD"

I click that button on widget... then widget sends some kind of command to the MainActivity.kt

inside MainActivity.kt lets say that i have some string: stringASD = "blablabla"

so I would like now this stringASD to be shown on the textviewASD which is located on my widget

For me, at this point, it doesnt matter if MainActivity.kt will set  text on viewtextASD or it will send that stringASD to the widget, and  then the widget itself will change the text :)

And very important is that I would like this to happen without my main app appearing on screen. Is that possible??
