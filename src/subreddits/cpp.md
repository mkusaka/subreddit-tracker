Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

## [2][Concurrency vs parallelism in C++](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ewia2e/concurrency_vs_parallelism_in_c/)

In C++, does concurrency require multiple threads? 

If yes, then is it not true that if every C++ concurrent program is run on a multi core system then it is also parallel?  Hence the following statement would be true:
Concurrency=parallelism, in C++ on multi core machines.

If no, then can you give me a simple single threaded C++ program which you can call concurrent?
