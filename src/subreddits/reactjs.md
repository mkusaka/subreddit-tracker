I recently redid my portfolio -  [http://www.jaykch.com/](http://www.jaykch.com/) 

Please let me know what you guys think, I will really appreciate it.

I also have following questions - 

* Based on my new portfolio should I apply for junior react.js positions or mid-level positions?
* Any other projects or type of projects I should have before applying for new jobs?
* I got offered a backend node.js positions, I don't want to have a career as a backend developer but I am open to being a full-stack developer, basically I love react so I don't want to get a career as a backend dev, but I am thinking of accepting because I am a student and leaving when I have graduated. Should I accept?

Hope you all are having a nice day!
## [6][Is it possible to create a non-Redux middleware?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eyq20x/is_it_possible_to_create_a_nonredux_middleware/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eyq20x/is_it_possible_to_create_a_nonredux_middleware/
---
It seems most middlewares in React applications are Redux middlewares. I am wondering why it's the case and if there's any reason and any way to create a non-Redux middleware. I personally haven't seen a non-Redux middleware before in a React application, so I am curious to know if there's anything like that.

I just launched [https://talksub.com](https://talksub.com/)

Stack: TypeScript, Apollo GraphQL, NextJS, ReactJS Hooks 

Supports: Server Side Rendering (SSR), Progressive Web App (Standalone app mode on mobile devices)

I completely migrated a few hundreds React components to hooks, and I love it.

I mobile optimized really hard for the past 2 months so check it out on your mobile as well and let me know if you find any issues.

I am using Styled Components for CSS, but not 100% satisfied with it. I want to migrate to PostCSS modules built-in supported by NextJS. However, there is SSR problem with it, so waiting for them to fix it.

Ask me any questions!

## [9][Redux thunk PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILURE pattern for CRUD and boilerplate](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eyhadh/redux_thunk_pending_success_failure_pattern_for/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eyhadh/redux_thunk_pending_success_failure_pattern_for/
---
I just started using Thunk, and it's great, but I don't know how to cut down on boilerplate. For example, the tutorials I have followed all suggest a similar pattern of a Thunk action that is async and dispatches three other actions (pending, success, failure). That is a total of four functions for one operation. Let's say that this is used to get a list of items for the database, this could be four functions to achieve this. Also, four more for updating an item in the database, and the same for the rest of the CRUD operations. How could you implement this to not end up with 20 functions for CRUD operations on one entity? (four functions for each CRUD operation: get all, get one, post, put / patch, delete)

Thanks!

Hi there!

Probably some of you know about [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). It is the website built for competitive programmers to let them practice their problem-solving skills.

I have built an app [Laddy](https://laddy.app) that shows problems for your Codeforces rating so you can solve them and improve throughout the time. This app is inspired by [A2OJ](https://www.a2oj.com/) which is retired by now.

Even though if you are not into competitive programming, you will be probably interested in the source code of Laddy which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/ironsoul0/laddy). It uses some cool technologies under the hood like TypeGraphQL, TypeORM, React + Typescript, Lerna for managing the monorepo, etc.

Any suggestions for code improvement are more than welcome!

If you want to register but do not have a Codeforces handle, just copy-paste mine - **ironsoul** (just for testing). 
## [12][Display Error at the Top of the Form using Formik and yup](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/eymdps/display_error_at_the_top_of_the_form_using_formik/)

Hi, I am using Formik and yup for forms in react. I am dealing with the use case where I need to display the required field errors on top of the form instead of displaying an error for each field. I am trying to loop through the errors object thrown by Formik, but ending up with an infinite loop.
