I have an Ajax response, within the object I have

`success: false and success: "" (true)`

How do I separate or call only json with a success: false ? or success: true ?

&amp;#x200B;

[screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/m1ypra9phhg41.png?width=897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb233863341e59f37436b8e92f33620d6f05b)

screenshot

So when I get my result like I can filter by success: true or success:false

`//Return all success: true`

`var result_true = json.data.map(function(d) {`  
`return {`  
   `name:` [`d.request.name`](https://d.request.name)`,`  
`success: d.success, //currently returning blank`  
   `column: d.column,`  
   `message: d.message`  
`}})`

\-------------------------------------------------------------

`//Return all success: false`

`var result_false = json.data.map(function(d) {`  
`return {`  
`name:` [`d.request.name`](https://d.request.name)`,`  
`success: d.success, //currently returning blank`  
`column: d.column,`  
`message: d.message`  
`}})`
