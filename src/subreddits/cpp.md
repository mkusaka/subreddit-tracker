**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

There has been a lot of talk about ABI breaks lately, criticism that the committeeâ€™s unwillingness to break the ABI is holding back improvements to the language, or that the ABI means unique_ptr has more overhead than a raw pointer. I'm pretty ignorant on these things, so maybe someone smarter than me can explain how this is a really dumb idea?

Where there is an ABI break (say with unique_ptr) why can't the compiler produce multiple versions of the symbol, one that is compatible with the old ABI, and one that has the breaking ABI change, differentiate them by name mangling differently. Then work out at link time what ABI the objects being linked were built with, and link to the appropriate version.

The duplicate definitions would only need to stay around for a few years, after which point it'd be safe to assume that everybody has had more than enough time to build against the new ABI. It'd provide a nice migration path between ABI's, that doesn't exist at the moment. Sure size would be ever so slightly larger for libraries, but I don't think this would be that significant?

Please somebody smarter than me explain why this wouldn't actually work. Because if we have a migration path between ABI's, what's all the hoohaa about breaking them?

The goal of this library is to provide a minimal interface for building a computational graph where each node can be executed asynchronously. I am looking for feedback in terms of code quality, potential features, uses cases, etc. Cheers!

Hey everyone

Im looking for new challenges to prepare me to work as a C++ programmer in the future. So far I have completed Udemy's course in advanced C++ programming and worked up my skill set on sites like hackerrank. Now I need to get to the next level while I have time during the quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

Id be open to online jobs, further course work, project suggestions or other things that I have no idea about. Im also considering paying for the 4 month Udacity course  


Any thoughts?  


Many thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

## [12][Starting C++ today with a strong Java background, and solid experience in Languages like Scala and Haskell. What habits should I break from the offset, because I'm currently going in using the language as if it were Java with different syntax.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gkizd4/starting_c_today_with_a_strong_java_background/)

I should probably be a bit clearer about what I mean. I'm currently learning the syntax for C++, and plan to write a compiler that I've already written in Java, in order to gain competence with the language. However I'm hesitant to go straight in, and effectively copy the whole class structure and logic across, because I reckon C++ probably has some very nice features that give it an advantage over Java, and I want to make sure I'm utilizing the language effectively
