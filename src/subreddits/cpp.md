Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

## [2][C++ London joins with Rust London to deliver cross-over content](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iq0y0m/c_london_joins_with_rust_london_to_deliver/)

Hi all,

This month the C++ London meetup are joining up with the Rust London meet-up and we have some talks lined on introducing Rust to C++ developers, include some comparing and contrasting. Rust has become a particular interest of many C++ developers (and many Rust developers are curious about C++ too). We aim to do a few of these - and while we're meeting online, this is, of course, open to everyone!

For more details, and to register, here's the meet-up link:

[https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/273113055/](https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/273113055/)

Note we'll be using Remo to host the meet-ups - the same platform that hosted C++ on Sea, and will host CppCon next week (and a few other upcoming conferences).

If you have any proposals for future events in this series, we'd be very interested to hear from you, too.

Good idea or bad idea? Here is one implementation: [https://github.com/ryanhaining/cppitertools](https://github.com/ryanhaining/cppitertools). I'd personally like to see this.

Hi, I am a newby in this and just having a lot of problems with VS code have been trying to install C++ in VS code and have followed the instruction, and still has not been able to run my code. I just want to try to use the same IDE for all my clases in VS code since started studying CS please if there is someone that would like to mentor a newby in the correct way please feel free to contact me.

thank you,

## [10][consteval question](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ipp9il/consteval_question/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ipp9il/consteval_question/
---
Hello,

I'm an embedded C programmer.  The consteval feature in c++ has caught my attention as something that would be useful in the embedded world.  I was wonder if something like the following was possible:

&amp;#x200B;

`const uint32_t register_val = calculate_register(500,2,6);`

`....`

`consteval uint32_t calculate_register(int val1, int val2, int val3)`

`{`

`// Do stuff to calculate what final register value should be`

`fprintf(//save register value to file at compile time`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

Important:  The code should not try to link to the fprintf symbol.  Pulling in libc is a big no.

&amp;#x200B;

## [11][Why are there no genuine type-lists (aka packs)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ip6nyj/why_are_there_no_genuine_typelists_aka_packs/)

Template parameter packs are such a powerful thing, but IMHO a very basic/fundamental thing is missing.

To get to the point, consider the ubiquitous pattern:

    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    struct MyThing
    {
        using Type = T;     // saves extra matching along the road
    };

Now, the question simply is: Why is there no built-in way to have

    template &lt;typename... Ts&gt;
    struct MyThing
    {
        using Types = Ts;
    };

On two quite different occasions the existence of such a 'type list' would have simplified my code a lot. It's hard to see how a compiler that can handle all the intricacies of packs, fold expressions, etc. could not handle a simple list like that.

Note: Please don't mention tuple before thinking about it.
