We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

hello everyone,

I finished a side project Ive been working on for a while, which is a Gatsby starter that has its own accompanying server, making it a sort of "Fullstack starter".

I noticed most starters are front end only which is a bummer, since Gatsby really shines with an API server.

The server part is a simple Node API server with CRUD operations that talks to a Postgres DB, and I also included instructions to deploy the server to heroku for free.

The front end Gatsby app is also very comprehensive and has everything you would want for a new project. The authentication especially was a little tricky to get right with a decoupled API server.

check it out, let me know what you guys think.

I'm happy to announce that my German book ["React lernen und verstehen"](https://buch.react-js.dev/) was translated into English and is finally available for sale worldwide! It's available as ebook and paperback. A hardcover version will available soon (only in the EU due to organizational reasons). 

You can find all the information on [https://book.react-js.dev/](https://book.react-js.dev/)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, I will gladly answer your questions! :)
## [11][How to deal with separation of components and request logic](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hykiqn/how_to_deal_with_separation_of_components_and/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hykiqn/how_to_deal_with_separation_of_components_and/
---
I have thought that for maintainability, I should implement all request logic separately from my UI components, given that a lot of code handling my async observable functionality clutters my component code. What are your thoughts on this? Just implementing request logic in another js module, and importing for use by the component to fetch data. 

For you folks that have production ready experience with React, what is the most common way you’ve seen this abstracted? I hate to ask “best practice” as it’s highly subjective... just looking for get professional opinion here. Thanks ahead of time.

I built a dating site aimed at helping you find people to go on game dates or have anime watch dates with. I learned a lot while building this site and there is still more I want to add/improve. I'm excited to hear what all your thoughts are on anything you would like to see, or any issues you run into!
