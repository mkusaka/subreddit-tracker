Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

## [3][What's the reliable and FOSS way to compile C++ code for Windows (on Linux)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fhnlwh/whats_the_reliable_and_foss_way_to_compile_c_code/)

I primarily develop my C++ applications (and everything else) on Linux, where there are two extremely good, FOSS, and maintained C++ compilers (GCC and clang).

Unfortunately, enough people use Windows that it's desirable to be able to produce Windows binaries. On windows, Microsoft's MSVC seems to have a similar level of support as GCC and Clang on Linux, but it has other issues. It's not FOSS. It doesn't work on Linux (forcing me to maintain 2 OS's for any sort of automated building). Besides not being FOSS, it has an unfavorable license that forces me to keep track of revenue, and eventually pay them. Perhaps these trade-offs are worth it, but that depends on what alternatives exist.

Clang, being extremely well supported, seems to be working on a Windows mode, but, unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be ready yet and still relies on MSVC's toolchain in key places, creating licensing issues. There may be some way to make it work, but I tried and failed to find it.

Mingw-w64 exists, works great, and has a good license, but, unfortunately, it seems to be not nearly as professionally run as Linux GCC (which has the Free Software Foundation, a serious and respected organization, behind it, and countless multi-billion dollar companies rely on it â€” it's not going anywhere). As evidence, consider that the Arch Linux packages (in AUR) are a full GCC version behind the native GCC packages, and that [their website](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) (for at least a week or so now) has had an expired TLS certificate (despite the fact that this fix can be automated quite easily). It looks like no one is actually putting the time in to maintain it, which makes me very cautious before relying on it in any way, and may make it worth it to pay Microsoft and deal with separate build infrastructure, although, there are even more flaws with that approach (then, anyone else who wants to work with my code needs to do the same, since I need ABI compatibility with 3rd party code in most of my projects).

One glimmer of hope is that the Arch Linux packages (in AUR)'s build scripts seem to pull their code from the main GCC repository. Is the necessary C++ code to build a working MinGW toolchain maintained with the GCC code in its main repository, in such a way that I can presumably learn how to build it whenever I want a maintained MinGw version?

So, how do you all address these concerns in your projects where you need to distribute Windows binaries? Is there a solution that addresses all concerns well?

I'm working on transpiler that make C++ looks modern but not modify to much. Here's my initial thought please suggest or add your ideas.

Sur: Syntactic Sugar for C++

- No more separating headers and sources (Will be generated automatically)
- Move `c` libraries to a folder and a namespace
- `enum` always behave like `enum class`
- Swap `::` with `:`
- Auto insert `std` when namespace is not given
- Introduce `newl` as `\n` sugar
- `'` as equivalent of `"`
- `\`` as char delimiter
- ( still bothering my mind ) remove semicolon

```
include 'iostream';
include 'string';
include 'c/stdio';

int main() {
  :cout &lt;&lt; glm:sin(10f) &lt;&lt; :newl;

  c:printf('%d', 10);

  :string str = 'my string';

  for (auto ch :: str) {
    :cout &lt;&lt; ch;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
## [9][Question: Websocket in STL](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fh1vfb/question_websocket_in_stl/)

I've found a number of libraries that do websockets in C++

* [https://docs.websocketpp.org/index.html](https://docs.websocketpp.org/index.html)
* [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1\_72\_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html)
* [https://libwebsockets.org](https://libwebsockets.org)

I was wondering what people used for this/is there an STL way of doing WebSockets easily?

The library needs to be permissive (Apache, MIT, BSD) because it's for an open source project.

Edit: I'm consuming a WebSocket API, not creating one.
## [10][Why there is no wchar_t variant of to_chars and from_chars?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fh5h8q/why_there_is_no_wchar_t_variant_of_to_chars_and/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fh5h8q/why_there_is_no_wchar_t_variant_of_to_chars_and/

It is especially painful on Windows where most text is `wchar_t`. `to_chars` and `from_chars` operate on `char*` buffers. But what is `char` anyway? It could be binary blob or it could be text. If it is text, what encoding is it in? It could be ASCII, UTF-8, ANSI (Windows codepage such as cp1250 or Shift-JIS), EBCDIC or something completely different. On some platforms, `char` is 16bits wide. This is bad for inter-compatibility. We already have `char` / `wchar_t` / `char8_t` / `char16_t` / `char32_t` types in Standard and also `std::string` is using them. Is there a reason why `to_chars` and `from_chars` didn't receive a bit of Unicode love? Is there a paper where I can read the rationale why this feature was not included?

Linked above is the benchmark source code, I set int max = 512 because it only allows 10 seconds of running time.

My main question for those interested at looking at the source code, is this a fair c++ benchmark or do any of the specific implementations have an unfair advantage? Also, any idea why quadsort is significantly faster on small arrays?

Output with max set to 1000000 and compiled with g++ -O3 -fpermissive source.cpp. Each result is the best run out of 100.

Summary:

quadsort wins 2 out of 7, timsort wins 4 out of 7, pdqsort wins 1 out of 7

quadsort is good at semi-ordered data and small arrays.

timsort is good at ordered / reverse ordered data.

pdqsort is good at random data and large arrays. (not a stable sort)

std::sort beats timsort and quadsort at random data. (not a stable sort)

The final test measures the average performance on 1000 arrays ranging from size 1 to 999 filled with random data.
