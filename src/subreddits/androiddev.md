* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Imagine that you have to update some third party libraries in your project. How will you check that nothing has been broken? Manual testing? Automated UI-tests? Maybe some other approach (like isolated tests for a certain library)?

## [5][For people using Appodeal, what does your "prominent disclosure" look like?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f390m3/for_people_using_appodeal_what_does_your/)

My app was removed with this as the reason:

&gt;Your app is using the Appodeal SDK, which is uploading userâ€™s phone number, social accounts and installed packages information without a prominent disclosure. Prior to the collection and transmission, it must prominently highlight how the user data will be used, describe the type of data being collected and have the user provide affirmative consent for such use.

I handwrote a crappy privacy policy that def deserved to get taken down, so I'm curious what a good Appodeal disclosure looks like before trying to make a new one and potentially getting another strike. I understand there are generators out there but it would be great to see what one looks like that is actually in a live app that's acceptable by Google.

Edit: also just read Appodeal recommends linking [their privacy policy](https://www.appodeal.com/home/privacy-policy/) in yours, so that must be a part of it.

Is it allowed to use Admob's interstitial ads when Back Button is pressed on a specific activity? Can't find a recent legit answer.

Getting old got a little bit of the shakes and when I try to do a long press sometimes I hold it to the icon but it interprets it as a short press or a click.

  


Is there anything out there that will help me?

## [9][How to test Android Intent's Bundle using Mockk?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f3967y/how_to_test_android_intents_bundle_using_mockk/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f3967y/how_to_test_android_intents_bundle_using_mockk/

I would like to test a custom handler class which is starting a new Activity. I would like to test the Intent's Bundle if contains the pre defined parameters.

**The test class**:

    @MockK
    lateinit var activity: ActivityCalendar
    
    @Before
    fun setUp() {
        MockKAnnotations.init(this)
    }
    
    @Test
    fun testActivityBundles() {
        val book = mockk&lt;Book&gt;()
    
        every { book.releaseDate } returns GregorianCalendar().apply { this.timeInMillis = 1423825586000 }
        every { activity.startActivity(any()) } just Runs
    
        val handler = ActivityHandler(activity)
        handler.startRequiredActivity(book)
    
        verify { activity.startActivity(
                withArg { intent -&gt;
                    val bundle = intent.extras!!
                    val releaseDateTimeMillis = bundle.getLong("release_date", 0L)
    
                    Assert.assertEquals(1423825586000, releaseDateTimeMillis)
                }
        ) }
    }

The code above is crashing at line: **val bundle = intent.extras!!** but it shouldn't.

**The class that I want to test**:

    class ActivityHandler(val activity: Activity) {
        fun startRequiredActivity(book: Book) {
            val intent = buildIntent(book)
    
            activity.startActivity(intent)
        }
    
        private fun buildIntent(book: Book): Intent {
            val extras = Bundle().apply {
                this.putLong("release_Date", book.releaseDate.timeInMillis)
            }
    
            return Intent(activity, ActivityBookDetails::class.java).apply {
                putExtras(extras)
            }
        }
    }
    
    data class Book(
            val releaseDate: GregorianCalendar
    )

I debugged the code and I found out that function **private fun buildIntent(book: Book): Intent** is returning an "null" object (string "null" and not Java NULL).
## [10][Integrating PayPal with NativeScript (Android only)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/f39250/integrating_paypal_with_nativescript_android_only/)

I'm just trying to get PayPal to work on Android right now. Many of the solutions online recommend using the PayPal sdk in the Gradle compile, but as far as I know the sdk has moved from the native to a CDN. Therefore, I'm stuck in a standoff.

1. Implement PayPal with WebView and just had a bridge.
2. Implement PayPal on the serverside since nodejs seems to have more support.
3. Implement PayPal on Android, which is the most confusing at this point.

Any help with this would be awesome and so would any resources to help me out.
