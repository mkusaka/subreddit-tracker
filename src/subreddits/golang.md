I'm kinda new to Go. i;ve worked w Python/Java/Node web frameworks and with them ive been using the standard MVC structure to build RESTful services and I've been thinking of building a Go RESTful api. Ive got a few questions.

1. What file structure would you recommend for a project that i would like to be maintainable/easy to add new features?
2.  should I use an ORM (eg GORM)? Ill be needing to make both easy SQL queries and some semi cmplex squeries involving a few joins. 
3. Should I just write all my queries raw like and just use go-migrate for db migration? 
4. What other Go packages should I look into to build the standard Go/Gin web server (ie gin-jwt, CORS, etc)

Thanks!

Hi everyone,  


I'm currently trying to have a go app without garbage collecting, i have two questions about it  
Is the GC only collecting in the heap? meaning every variable in the stack not being concerned by GC?  
Is it possible to do a 100% app with variables on the stack?  


Thanks for your help, I am a bit lost on it and can't find the ultimate resource.
