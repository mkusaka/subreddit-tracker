**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely (permanently, or for the duration of the pandemic)? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

Are Microsoft developers presented with a single GIT repository with the entire Windows code? Or the operating system is broken down into projects/subsystems to which a given developer is granted access?

If its the wrong sub just point me to the place where i might find the answers.  
Im coming from a world of web dev and right now im working on a pretty big project with complex dragndrop ui and my question to all of the desktop developers of big and complex things like photoshop is - how do you keep your sanity? How do you manage tech debt? What abstractions do you use for building your UI?. Im asking because the web way of doing thing like google maps/ spreadsheets is unmanageable madness(How many times was facebook rewritten? 3?)

It’s quite simple and not many features are here yet. I’m also quite inexperienced with C++ so any criticism is appreciated.

Hi All,

I have compiled a collection and article on how to correctly follow C++ class member initializations, constructors, and member functions.

After reading C++ guidelines, and a few other references I have put together this article.

This article covers the following -

1. Use member initializers in the same order as their declaration
2. Prefer in-class member initializer over constant initializations OR over default constructor.
3. Don’t cast away const, ever!
4. Use delegating constructors to represent common actions for all constructors of a class.

:) Please help me in improving anything which is incorrect or missing in this.
## [12][Blogging platform that supports C/C++](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/hnem1b/blogging_platform_that_supports_cc/)

DISCLAIMER: This might be understood as self promotion and in a way it is, since I did create this project. I posted this same project on [haskell subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/hljinx/blogging_platform_that_supports_haskell/) and they liked it. If you think this is some kind of self promotion, check it out and tell me in the comments and I will remove it. Or the moderators can remove it. But I hope you're going to like it. 

I created a blogging platform that  supports creating blogs that can executing code. There is also an integrated code editor with which you can create complete projects and import them into your blog. After that, the readers of your blog can execute/edit your code without having to setup environments locally, or cloning github repos and all other pain that goes with "just trying things out". There is much improvement to be done but its slowly going there. 

Yesterday,  I integrated support for C/C++ so you can create blog posts and coders/beginners can edit/run your code. As I said in Haskell group, I hope this will help beginners in C/C++ a little bit. You can learn more in a [help blog post](https://therebelsource.com/blog/help-blog/8mYgnax8Nj) and on the [about page](https://therebelsource.com/about). Unfortunately, for C/C++ and Haskell, it is not yet possible to create code projects. Compiling those languages is not so straightforwared like in Go, for example where I can just do `go run /my/dir` and it just works. But support for them is coming. 

Thank you for your time and I hope you like it.
