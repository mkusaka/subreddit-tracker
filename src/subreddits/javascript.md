Post a link to a GitHub repo that you would like to have reviewed, and brace yourself for the comments!
Whether you're a junior wanting your code sharpened or a senior interested in giving some feedback and have some time to spare, 
this is the place.

I have looked online, and the only sites which come uo are google's. I havent found them helpful. So I am looking for other sources.

It would be really helpful if someone can guide me through this. You should know that I am from India, so there is a separate 'Google pay for India' section I am concerned with.

Thank you

Need code to redirect [domain.com/page](https://domain.com/page) based on OS

Made a new index.html and pasted it on /page folder with following conents:`&lt;html&gt;`

`&lt;head&gt;`

`&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;`

`&lt;!--`

`var OSName="Unknown OS";`

`if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Win")!=-1) OSName="Windows";`

`if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Mac")!=-1) OSName="MacOS";`

`if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("X11")!=-1) OSName="UNIX";`

`if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Linux")!=-1) OSName="Linux";`

&amp;#x200B;

`if( OSName == "Windows" )`

`{`

`window.location="`[`https://www.windows.com`](https://www.windows.com)`";`

`}`

`else if ( OSName == "MacOS" )`

`{`

`window.location="`[`https://www.macos.com`](https://www.macos.com)`";`

`}`

`else if ( OSName == "UNIX" )`

`{`

`window.location="`[`https://www.unix.com`](https://www.unix.com)`";`

`}`

`else if ( OSName == "Linux )`

`{`

`window.location="`[`https://www.linux.com`](https://www.linux.com)`";`

`}`

`else`

`{`

`window.location="`[`vwww.other.com`](https://vwww.other.com)`";`

`}`

`//--&gt;`

`&lt;/script&gt;`

`&lt;/head&gt;`

`&lt;/html&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

What is the reason that it won't work? It just gives me blank page when I visit domain.com/page
