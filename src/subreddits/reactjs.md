We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

The React component tree doesn't seem to make any logical sense.

I can't figure out which of the above I'm supposed to be using when trying to work with React.memo, context, etc.

Maybe it's just me but is there a cheatsheet or something anywhere?
## [6][React app doesn't compile when run in a docker container](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ias2k5/react_app_doesnt_compile_when_run_in_a_docker/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ias2k5/react_app_doesnt_compile_when_run_in_a_docker/
---
Hi all,

I'm currently trying to run my react app in a docker container but for some reason it can't resolve the dependencies when I run it.

To create the docker container I have this Dockerfile:

`FROM node:alpine`  
`WORKDIR /app`  
`COPY package*.json ./`  
`RUN npm install`  
`COPY . .`  
`CMD ["npm", "start"]`

and I ignore node\_modules in my .dockerignore

I then run it using this docker-compose.yml:

`version: '3.8'`

`services:`        

`react-app:`

`image: react-app:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

`stdin_open: true`

`volumes:`

`- /app/node_modules`

`ports:`

`- "3000:3000/tcp"`

These are the docker logs which show the compile error:

`webpack output is served from`

`Content not from webpack is served from /app/public`

`404s will fallback to /`

`Starting the development server...`

&amp;#x200B;

`Failed to compile.`

&amp;#x200B;

`./src/App.tsx`

`Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-router-dom' in '/app/src'`

`Compiling...`

`Failed to compile.`

&amp;#x200B;

`./src/App.tsx`

&amp;#x200B;

I have this dependency in the "dependencies" section of my package.json:

`"@types/react-router-dom": "^5.1.5"`

and the app compiles when I run it outside of the docker container.

If I exec into the docker container I can see that /app/node\_modules/@types/react-router-dom does exist so it looks like npm install isn't the issue. Am I missing something in my compose file? Or am I importing it incorrectly in the code? My import statement is:

`import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'`

Thanks for any help.

I have to fetch 30,000 users from an api and display them in some format.  

What is the best and most performant approach to manage pagination in this scenario.  Have to handle on the frontend side only.

I recently saw in some source a developer doing this:

`import React, { Component } from 'react';`. 

I am new to React, from a reading point of view I personally like it. However is this good practice and are there any draw backs?
## [10][Update doesn't work](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iarjsb/update_doesnt_work/)

Hello,

I use "http method put" but it's doesn't work, I can't update my article.

I get my articles and I create "input type=text" , "textarea" and "put button" under my article for receive and update.

Normally, when I change the words and click in put button, my article must update.

    state={		
    		titleArticle: "",
    		contentArticle: "",
    		articles: []
    	}
    
    componentDidMount(){
    		this.articleGet()
    	}
    
    
    handleClickPut = e =&gt;  {
    		
    		const {titleArticle, contentArticle, categorie} = this.state;
    		this.articlePut(titleArticle, contentArticle, categorie);
    		
    	}
    
    handleChange(e) {
    		e.preventDefault();
    		this.setState({ [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
    
    	}
    
    
    articlePut(id, titleArticle, contentArticle, categorie) {
    		
    
    		fetch("http://localhost:3200/api/society/school-systeme/" + id, {
    
    			method: "PUT",			
    			
    			body: JSON.stringify({
    				
    				
    				titleArticle,
    				contenuArticle,
    				categorie
    			}),  
    
    			headers: {
    				"Content-Type": "application/json",
    				"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    			}
    
    		
    		})
    
    
    		.then(res =&gt; {
    			if (res.status === 200) {
    				res.json().then(res =&gt; {					
    					
    				})			
    			
    
    			}
    
    			else {
    
    				console.log("Update doesn't work")
    			
    			}
    		})
    
    		.catch(errors =&gt;{
    			console.log(errors);
    		}) 
    
    			
    
    				
    	} 
    
            const map = article.map((article) =&gt; (
    
    	&lt;div className="contentSchoolSysteme" key={article._id}&gt;
    			&lt;h1&gt;{article.titleArticle}&lt;/h1&gt;
    
    			&lt;p&gt;{article.contentArticle}&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;form className="PutForm" onSubmit = {this.handleClickPut}&gt;	 
    	&lt;input type="text" name="titleArticle" defaultValue={article.titleArticle}
    	 onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)} /&gt;
    
    
    	 &lt;textarea rows="30" name="contentArticle" defaultValue=article.contentArticle} onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)} /&gt;
    
    	 &lt;input type="text" name="categorie" placeholder="categorie"
    	 onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)} className="categorie"/&gt;
    
    	 &lt;button  onClick={this.articlePut.bind(this, article._id)} &gt;PUT&lt;/button&gt;
    
    
    &lt;/form&gt;		 

For exemple, when I try to change my title article in "Fun lesson", I receive :

CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "Fun lesson" at path "\_id" for model "Article"

reason: Error: Argument passed in must be a single String of 12 bytes or a string of 24 hex characters
## [11][In useState setter function, when to pass a function vs a value?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/iarjb5/in_usestate_setter_function_when_to_pass_a/)

Let say I have this state:  
  
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);  
  
Now, when to use this:  
  
    setCounter(prevCounter =&gt; prevCounter + 1);  
  
vs  
  
    setCounter(counter + 1);  
  
I couldn't find any proper explanation of when to use one over another. Is there a situation in which one would give different output than the other?
