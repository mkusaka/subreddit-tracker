"net-sftp" last official release was in 2013. The current maintainer (Miklós Fazekas) has issued a release candidate today.

I believe it is important for a language like Ruby to have a well maintained library for this protocol (which is widely used in mid/large companies for low-tech data exchange).

If you have some use of it, please go test it and provide feedback!

Have a safe day.

Hello all,

I've been learning the basics for ruby and gosu for the past few weeks and I'd like to try and create some form of application that can be used. Does anyone have suggestions for apps that can be made for beginners?

Are there comprehensive guides to using Ruby in "raw" form? I may just be missing something very obvious, especially since this is just a hobby for me. Everything I seem to find is full of sugar, and I admittedly dislike using it. I tend to enjoy languages such as Ada, that don't use much of that sort of thing. I enjoy writing Ruby, I just also like my code to be written in "longhand" form so I fully understand what is going on.

What are the best online resources or books to learn Ruby and Rails?

Do you have any useful plugins or suggestions on how to do it? Ideally I would probably want to auto-format whole file, but the tools to do so are not quire there yet. At the moment pasting some nested structures from console to test files is quite a pain.
