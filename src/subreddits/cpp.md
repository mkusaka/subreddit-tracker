Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

[eCAL](https://github.com/continental/ecal) is a  modern C++ interprocess communication framework designed for low latency and massive data throughput. It was developed by a Continental R&amp;D team to manage distributed high performance computing for autonomous driving prototyping cars.

The API design is inspired by [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) but it has built in shared memory transport from the start and supports modern message protocols like [Google Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) or [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) (infinitely fast ;-)).

Finally there are some powerful applications for monitoring, recording and replaying the whole interprocess communication in a distributed manner.
