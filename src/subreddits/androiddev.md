This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

## [4][Is Sceneform dead?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/glduwe/is_sceneform_dead/)

Shortly after publishing the sources on March 20 the [Sceneform GitHub repository](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk) has been archived and the documentation states it will no longer be published but one has to copy the sources to the own project. That's an... interesting step. Also Sceneform no longer uses `SFA` and `SFB` files which is also an interesting decision to change that in a minor release (1.15 -&gt; 1.16).

Has anybody insights on that? Does this mean the project is dead? 

Since I do not use ARCore, but only the `SceneView` should I transition to [Filament](https://github.com/google/filament) (which seems to be developed more actively anyway) directly?

I've got an internship, which will start in two months for native android development. But the last time I've written an android app is already nearly a year ago. During the last year, I've worked only with flutter. I now want to make two to three small apps during this time, to get to know android development better than I ever have, but I don't really know which resources/tutorials would be the best to learn.

What do you recommend?

I've just received this email. Someone wants to make a serious business out of selling fake review.   
Can we do something about it?

## [7][What is your preferred implementation of MVI design pattern ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gldp2m/what_is_your_preferred_implementation_of_mvi/)

As we all know, design patterns existed for solving common software problem and we adapt the pattern to fit more with our projects and the way we work like changing the layers, creating some helper base classes, extension functions, your best way of implementing the machine state, frameworks that help you, snippets and so on.  
It would be great to share your implementations or reference article.
## [8][What is your opinion on using data binding?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gld5du/what_is_your_opinion_on_using_data_binding/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gld5du/what_is_your_opinion_on_using_data_binding/
---
I haven't used data binding before but from what I have read I think using data binding in projects is overkill.

With view binding and code in activity classes populating views, I think it is more understandable and much easier to get someone new involved in a project.

Are there any benifits to it I am missing? Can you share why you prefer using it?

I've created a project for automatic bridging from C++ to Java (among other languages). Please take a look: [Scapix](https://github.com/scapix-com/scapix). If you try the project, I would love to hear your opinions and suggestions. Thanks!
