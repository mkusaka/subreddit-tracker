**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

Pearson [lists](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/PGM2060260.html) the second edition of Koenig and Moo classic.

The "buy" link leads to a [product page](https://www.informit.com/store/accelerated-c-plus-plus-practical-programming-by-example-9780135166789) that says:

- Published May 2, 2020 by Addison-Wesley Professional
- This product currently is not for sale

There is the ISBN, but no cover image or table of contents or anything more specific. There is no other information anywhere. 

Can we hope that this will eventually materialize?
## [5][Which subsumes which? Movable subsumes swappable, or vice versa?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ggvpj5/which_subsumes_which_movable_subsumes_swappable/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ggvpj5/which_subsumes_which_movable_subsumes_swappable/
---
I always have an impression that swapping is defined in terms of moving (or copying). A typical unspecialized swap function would looks like:

	template &lt;class T&gt;
	constexpr void swap(T&amp; lhs, T&amp; rhs) noexcept( /* some type traits */ )
	{
		T tmp(std::move(lhs));
		lhs = std::move(rhs);
		rhs = std::move(tmp);
	}

The swappable requirement of the standard requires either specialized ADL-`swap` or unspecialized `std::swap` ( [eel.is](http://eel.is/c++draft/swappable.requirements) ). And the general version of `std::swap` requires `std::is_move_constructible_v&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp; std::is_move_assignable_v&lt;T&gt;` ( [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/swap) ). This makes me further believe swapping is in terms of moving.

But then, I find the definition of C++20 `std::movable` concept. ( [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts/movable) )

	template &lt; class T &gt;
	concept movable =
		std::is_object_v&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp;
		std::move_constructible&lt;T&gt; &amp;&amp;
		std::assignable_from&lt;T&amp;, T&gt; &amp;&amp;
		std::swappable&lt;T&gt;;

What have I missed?

1. Why is `movable` defined in terms of `swappable`? Why does `movable` subsumes `swappable`? 
2. Would the other way round work? Can we define `swappable` in terms of `movable`?
3. I have the intuition that "A is defined in terms of B" implies "A subsumes B". Have I been wrong all along?

# What's EnTT

[`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) is a header-only library written in **modern C++**.

It's mainly known for its [entity-component-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) model. However, it offers also [many other things](https://github.com/skypjack/entt#introduction) useful during development, from flexible tools for managing signals to an integrated reflection system and so on.

`EnTT` is also a production-ready, fully documented and battle-tested library with a 100% coverage. [Among others](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/EnTT-in-Action), It's currently used in **Minecraft** by Mojang and the **ArcGIS Runtime SDK** by Esri.

# Why it's important for you

I think it can matter because the **best feedback** I've ever received is perhaps when someone told me that this library was a great source for studying modern C++. Maybe he was right, maybe not. It's not for me to say, but it may still interest you.

In any case, I hope I've given other material to those interested in it in this sense and I'm open to any feedback, because ours is a language in which you never stop learning. So, go for it!

# What else

In my free time I'm running the [ECS back and forth](https://skypjack.github.io/tags/#ecs) series (along with [other posts](https://skypjack.github.io/)).  
I also started working on a project based on `EnTT` and a series of accompanying articles to be released on GH, as anticipated with the last post. However, the lockdown is slowing everything down in my life and made things much more complicated. I hope to be able to resume soon also on this project.

If you are using `EnTT` and want to tell me *hello* or which of your products relies on it, do not hesitate to [contact me](https://github.com/skypjack)! For everyone else interested in the library, the [wiki](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki) contains more than what I've said here and the [gitter](https://gitter.im/skypjack/entt) channel is a great place to come and ask your first question!  
Oh, right, we have also a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5BjPWBd) now! Hurry up!

I'm looking forward to hearing from you. :)

I am one of those programmers that care a lot abut performance. So I was wondering whether static methods are faster. As I always do in such a case, I create a simple test setup. The results can be find in my bog posts linked below.

## [11][[Tooling] Memcheck-cover: A valgrind's memcheck tool wrapper and HTML report generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gfzk60/tooling_memcheckcover_a_valgrinds_memcheck_tool/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gfzk60/tooling_memcheckcover_a_valgrinds_memcheck_tool/
---
Hello,

I initially added a valgrind memcheck build, a few years ago, on my professional project.As the years passed, I started to create an HTML report so the developers could analyze valgrind's memcheck tool report with more ease. I added colored highlights for that.

A few month ago I thought "Hey that might interest other people !". So I started the memcheck-cover project.My goal was to start from scratch and improve the ideas I put on my professional build.

I decided to create two scripts.The first one would be a helper to make it easy to run a binary under Vilgrind's memcheck tool and get the report.The second one would be the more complicated one: the HTML report generator.

I went trough Valgrind 3.15.0 sources to find as much information as I can and started to build the scripts.

I'm proud (if I may) to present you the 1st release of my project.Here is the link : [https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/releases/tag/release-1.0](https://github.com/Farigh/memcheck-cover/releases/tag/release-1.0)

Here is a demo : [https://david-garcin.github.io/demos/memcheck-cover/index.html](https://david-garcin.github.io/demos/memcheck-cover/index.html)

Don't hesitate to try it, share it, suggest improvements to it and open issues :)

Thanks,
