Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

I finish a course of C++, I know about the rules of the language (data types, control flows, pointers, object oriented,  standard library, etc). Now I want to start with the next step, of the rules of the software development like the tools (compilers, debugger, test, etc) and also the management of the headers files. Any course do you suggest? Or should I learns in the hard way? (I would like to program in a professional way on Unix systems)

I have been playing around with [repl.it](https://repl.it) and integrating CMake into it for interviews. I basically wanted to see what the tool was actually capable of. Some requirements that I was looking for:

1. CMake (or some Build System) Integration
2. IDE to reflect the project
3. code completion, auto-completion, and tooling support (asan, tsan, etc)

Anyhow, anyone who wants to play around with a cool tool for code collaboration I recommend it! I have a repository [https://github.com/JeremyBorys/repl-cpp11](https://github.com/JeremyBorys/repl-cpp11) which have the changes I made to integrate with CMake. My guess is that the same changes would also be done for meson or some other build system generator as well.

This does require creating a free repl account.

I inherited a large code base that uses `using namespace std` in a header file included everywhere. I would like to get rid of that but in order to be able to remove it I need to add `std::` everywhere. Is there a tool that can do this for me?

TypeScript to C++  transpiler

[https://github.com/ASDAlexander77/TypeScript2Cxx](https://github.com/ASDAlexander77/TypeScript2Cxx)

I have written the app to transpile TypeScript into C++.  I did it as I like C++ but I don't like its syntax, so I deceived why not to use TS syntax to generate C++ code.
