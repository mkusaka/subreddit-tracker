## [2][How to type return type of a function based on given argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fo2rsk/how_to_type_return_type_of_a_function_based_on/)

Probably the title is wrong, i couldn't figure out how to explain it. Here is a simplified version of the problem.


```
type Foo&lt;T&gt; = {
    getValue: () =&gt; T;
};

function createFoo&lt;T&gt;(value: T): Foo&lt;T&gt; {
    return {
        getValue: () =&gt; value
    };
}

let items = {
    apple: createFoo(1),
    orange: createFoo('hello'),
};

function combine(items) {
    //
}

let combined = combine({
    apple,
    orange
});


/*
combined's type should be

{
    apple: number,
    orange: string
}
*/
```

Thank you :)

For practice I'm working on an algorithm that assigns values as (object) key names. The keys are paired to an array.

This is in raw  JS. In TS I don't know how to handle objects with dynamic key names:

    { joe : [{...}, {...}, {...}], sally : [{...}, {...}]  } 

(key names will vary)

Anyone know how to properly type these?

Trying to grok `typedi` and came up with this. Is following right?

1. `@Inject()` injects `Container` into decorated class properties,  
*Hint: **InjectContainer**IntoProp*
2. `@Service()` injects `Container` into decorated classes via constructor params,  
*Hint: **InjectContainer**IntoClassViaConstructorParams*
3. `@Service{'&lt;name&gt;')` injects `Container` into decorated classes and provides that classes via `&lt;name&gt;` via `Container.get('&lt;name&gt;')`,  
*Hint: **InjectContainer**IntoClassViaConstructorParamsAnd**ProvideClass**ViaAlias*

1 is mandatory for classes without a constructor. 2 is mandatory if a constructor with params injects the dependency. 3 is the one which actually act as a *service*.

A more intuitive naming scheme would have been:  
1: `@InjectToProp()`   
2: `@InjectViaConstructor()`  
3: `@ProvideAs('&lt;name&gt;')`

Hello all,

I am learning Typescript and I was naming my interfaces happily until I arrived to Mongodb/Mongoose.  


For example, I had before an interface called User. However, when I create my model schema, in mongo without Typescript I would have called this User as well. Therefore, that would create a conflict.  


Is there a common convention about this?  


I see this guy in the link down below uses IUser but I have read also that Typescript community does not like using Iwhatever... and personally I do not like that either.

Therefore, do you know what is the most common way to naming mongo stuff and interfaces?  


Thank you in advance.
## [6][Need help with spread operator and Date in typescript](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fnhe74/need_help_with_spread_operator_and_date_in/)

Consider the below code:
```
export function(date :string) : Date{  
 const dateNumbers : number[] = date.split(/,|-| |:/).map(numText =&gt; Number(numText))  
 console.log(...dateNumbers);  
 return new Date(...dateNumbers)  
}
```
I cannot use spread operator for the new Date in typescript, but I actually can use it in javascript, the error is Expected 0-7 arguments, but got 0 or more.ts(2556)

Please help me with that, I could not figure it out.
## [7][Can't seem to augment typed NPM module?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fnn5tf/cant_seem_to_augment_typed_npm_module/)

I'm trying to augment a certain [typed npm module called iam-policies](https://github.com/Rogger794/iam-policies). The types I'm trying to augment are declared [here](https://github.com/Rogger794/iam-policies/blob/master/src/types.ts). So far, here's what I've come up with (in a file called `iam-policies.d.ts`):
```ts
import { EEntityPolicyEnumPrincipal } from './types/principal.enum';
import { EClient }                    from './types/client.enum';
import { conditionResolvers }         from './iam/conditions';
import { Patterns, ConditionMap, ConditionKey, ActionBlock, ResourceBlock, NotResourceBlock } from 'iam-policies/dist/src/types';

declare module 'iam-policies' {

    type PrincipalMap = {
        [key in EEntityPolicyEnumPrincipal]?: EClient | EClient[]
    }

    type AugmentedConditionBlock = {
        [key in keyof typeof conditionResolvers]?: ConditionMap
    }

    interface ConditionBlock extends AugmentedConditionBlock {}

    // The above code works for some reason...

    type AugmentedConditionKey = Date | Date[];

    type AugmentedResolver = (data: AugmentedConditionKey, expected: AugmentedConditionKey) =&gt; boolean
    
    type AugmentedConditionResolver = {
        [key in keyof typeof conditionResolvers]?: AugmentedResolver
    }

    type AugmentedContext = {
    [key: string]: ConditionKey | Context | string[] | number[] | boolean[];
}

    export interface Context extends AugmentedContext {}

    interface ConditionResolver extends AugmentedConditionResolver {}
}
```

`conditionResolvers` is an object of string properties with functions for values:

```ts
const conditionResolvers = {
    prop1: (data, expected) =&gt; logic...,
    prop2: (data, expected) =&gt; logic...,
...
}
```

Among the many errors I've received throughout my many attempts are the following (sorry I didn't write them down as I was trying to debug and try my next attempt):
- Duplicate identifier.
- Incorrect index signature.
- Type x does not extend type y correctly.

My `tsconfig` is basically the [Typescript starter NestJS has](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter).

I've already augmented Express's typings like so (in a file called `express.d.ts`):
```ts
import { CookieOptions } from 'express';
import { IJwtPayload }   from './types/interfaces/payload.jwt.interface';
import { IEntityUser }   from './user/user.entity';

declare module 'express-serve-static-core' {
    interface Request {
        user?: IJwtPayload | Partial&lt;IEntityUser&gt;;
    }
}
declare module 'express' {
    interface CookieSettings {
        name    : string;
        value?  : string;
        options?: CookieOptions;
    }
}

```

I'd appreciate any help I can get. I already posted on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/q/60797716/1934402) without any responses. You're welcome to answer to get the correct answer.

 Good Morning I'm beginning to learn nestJS for a backend and so far liking it... 

I'm trying to wire up a front end React as i go along. this code snippet has no back end, it's just an example.

i'm puzzled by this typeScript issue.

The front end makes a request to the backend and what comes back is unknown, i know that it's a TaskI, because that's what the backend is responding with, but i wanted to emulate the case where the front end typescript can't know that and has to "prove" it out. so i set the data to type unknown... 

I was expecting a TS complaint, but here it allows me to push an any into my TaskI array, do you know why this is?

I shouldn't be able to push an any into a typed array.

More generally, not having worked with type unknown before, this is the concept of using type unknown, to prove to the compiler that a type is indeed a type?

Thanks for your time and consideration.

## [11][Confused by generic related compilation error.](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fmgw5y/confused_by_generic_related_compilation_error/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fmgw5y/confused_by_generic_related_compilation_error/

Basically the code that I have that is leading to the compilation error is similar to this:

```
class Box&lt;T&gt; {

}

class Gen&lt;T extends Box&lt;number&gt;&gt; {
    private action(array: Array&lt;T&gt;): Array&lt;T&gt; {
        return new Array()
    }

    private useAction() {
        let x:Box&lt;number&gt;[] = new Array&lt;Box&lt;number&gt;&gt;();
        // This leads to the compilation error
        this.action(x)
    } 
}
```

I would expect this to work.

I defined `action` to take an array of any type, hence the `array:Array&lt;T&gt;`

In `useAction` I am calling the `action` method.

I am calling it with an array of `Box&lt;number&gt;`

Since I defined it to take any type, I expected passing a variable of type `Box&lt;number&gt;` to `action` should then work. 

But it fails with a compilation error:

&gt; Argument of type 'Box&lt;number&gt;[]' is not assignable to parameter of
&gt; type 'T[]'.   Type 'Box&lt;number&gt;' is not assignable to type 'T'.
&gt;     'Box&lt;number&gt;' is assignable to the constraint of type 'T', but 'T' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint
&gt; 'Box&lt;number&gt;'.

I can't decipher the error message. Why is it failing and how do I fix it?

I asked the question on StackOverflow, if you know how to crack this riddle, please feel free to answer the question over there
