Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fmosnb/how_can_anyone_use_stdchronosteady_clock_portably/

I'm writing a cross-platform real-time audio/video processing library and I need a clock with some guarantees:

  1. monotonic
  2. with at least 1 microsecond resolution (how frequently the value changes)
  3. always increasing even if the thread sleeps

Looking over at cppreference.com I see that [`std::chrono::steady_clock`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/steady_clock) provides the guarantee #1.

However, `std::chrono::steady_clock` mentions no minimal guaranteed resolution. [There are horror stories on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29551126) saying that their `std::chrono::steady_clock` has only 10ms resolution. Something like:

       static_assert(std::chrono::duration_cast&lt;std::chrono::milliseconds&gt;(typename std::chrono::steady_clock::duration(1)).count() &lt;= 1, "Your C++ compiler doesn't provide a precise enough steady_clock.");

might do the trick, as long as the C++ compiler is actually aware of its clock resolution. It won't work if it reports 1ns resolution at compile time but is actually 10ms at run time. So #2 falls short as the clock resolution is actually not defined - neither the minimal resolution is mandated by the spec, nor you can reliably check it at compile time.

Reading [this stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38252022) it appears like the C++ specification doesn't prohibit `std::chrono::steady_clock` to be stopped when the thread sleeps, similar to how `clock()` behaves. While it appears that no common C++ compiler implementation does this, it's also not prohibited, so relying on this sounds like undefined behavior.

So `std::chrono::steady_clock` falls short in #2 and #3. Isn't this really bad? With so much being left up to the compiler implementations, how can anyone use `std::chrono::steady_clock` portably at all? It's pretty much broken for a lot of use cases. Sure, you could probably run some tests at your program startup, to check if clock lies about the precision and if it ticks during thread sleeps, but such startup diagnostics have no place in a mere library. I now have to implement my own cross-platform OS clock abstraction since system APIs provide stricter clock guarantees than `std::chrono` does.

I heard many times that one shouldn’t start any new project in C++ these days. Comments like “I’m writing in C++ for 20+ years and I hate that language” seem to be pretty common here in reddit. While you may be capped in C++ because of existing code base at work / current project and it may be too late to switch to another language, would you still choose C++ for your project in 2020? Considering that C++ is widely used in your type of projects, e.g if you’d be like to write your own 2D game library to use it for your 2D game of your dream.

I have an idea for 2D game since 2017 and writing 2D framework from scratch is the best option (2D multiplayer Rimworld-alike, could send .docx description in Russian if interesting). Soon I will have time for making it, but I don’t want to regret with language choice in future. Want to hear your opinions, thanks!
