I don’t mind starting from the basics as long as I reach JavaScript. If the other programming languages help me build my way up to JS, then I don’t mind taking my time to learn those.

Some of my classmates hopped right into JS, but I rather take my time to learn the basics and work my way into JS and eventually learn Python...

Any advice or feedback of what I should do/ start with would be greatly appreciated. 

Btw, I’m learning this programming languages through CodeAcademy since it’s free!
