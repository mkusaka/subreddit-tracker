I thought it would be good if I share some of my CLI based utility for tracing **NSQ** messages built with Golang here. In case someone needs it.

Am doing integration with a third party and the communication is being done over TCP sockets. They have this requirement(**Message variable length indicator**) where am supposed to represent the XML message length as a 2 binary byte message length.

For example, my message is 1024 in length. How do I represent 1024 as binary two-bytes?

Helps k8s-less provisioning and updating to the newer version of a stateless container without pains of recalling the command-line options used to start the container.

Hello everyone, I'm new to golang. The question is in the title. Right now I settled on the Iris framework [https://www.iris-go.com/](https://www.iris-go.com/) because it is the newest and seems to be powerful. What do you use in commercial projects and what do you like the most?

I'm toying with the idea of writing a GUI for a terminal application I've created in the past year - what are the best current options for creating a GUI with Go today?

Hi folks,

I would like to present my project that I was working on for the last couple of months. Luks.go - a pure-Golang library to manage partitions encrypted with LUKS [https://github.com/anatol/luks.go](https://github.com/anatol/luks.go)

If you need to deal with LUKS partition in your golang application then luks.go is your friend. Luks.go allows you to unlock a LUKS partition without using system dynamic libraries or standalone tools like cryptsetup. Pulling such system dependencies is a PITA especially if your tool needs to work across different OS versions.

Currently luks.go supports unlocking only. In the future it might contain operations that modify luks metadata (e.g. adding/removing keyslots). Though this functionality is more dangerous and requires more time for development and testing.

This work has been sponsored by my employer - Twitter. The project has been started as a part of Twitter hackathon week. I want to say thanks to my company and my manager for supporting me in my open-source work.

This is a golang project I've been working on off-and-on for a while.  Originally, it was to help suite my needs to analyze massive amounts of log files (gigabytes+) and get incremental output, rather than waiting for something like \`zcat | uniq\` to run.  I still use it from time to time, but wanted to share with you all

Here's an example of analyzing nginx log files for statuses:

    ./rare histo -m '" (\d{3})' -e "{bucket {1} 100}" -xz testdata/*
    400                 5,807,761  [69.4%] ||||||||||||||||||||||||||
    200                 2,565,032  [30.6%] |||||||||||
    300                 535        [ 0.0%] 
    
    
    Matched: 8,373,328 / 8,383,717 (Groups: 3)

It supports a range of features similar to other programs you're already used to: gunzipping, regex search, simple handlebars-like expressions, ignore patterns, etc.

Hope you like my project.  Always happy to take feedback!  I went through great pains to optimize this, and learned a lot about go in the process.
