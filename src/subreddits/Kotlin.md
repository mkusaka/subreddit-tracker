Hi everyone, I am Rohit. I wanted to get some feedback from the community.

&amp;#x200B;

We've recently launched a product - SDK X. Its an Admob Automation Tool to help you improve revenues. It automates a lot of experiments that you would have to manually perform in firebase or write and maintain custom code. Some examples -  A/B testing for the right refresh rates for each banner unit, custom code to enable refresh for native advanced, improve CPM through cross format mediation for banners. All these and more are completely automated!

&amp;#x200B;

Our goal is to give our product to potential users and receive their honest feedback as well as help us prove some of the newer concepts we plan to build in our product. So we are looking for a group of people from this community who will be eager to work with us and share their feedback. Ideally, if you are looking to improve your revenue by working on core revenue KPIs - Match rate, Impression RPM and CTR.

&amp;#x200B;

We really appreciate your time and are offering upto a $100 Amazon Gift Voucher + Lifetime FREE access to SDK X for your contribution.

I want to make a Kotlin GUI application packed into a standalone JAR (or with a tiny EXE that runs the JAR) that runs on Java 8 (the most installed Java version) in order to make using it as easy as possible.

I heard that there are problems with JavaFX in the modern day that requires users to install JavaFX alongside JRE, and I don't want my users to be bothered with this.

So, which GUI technology should I use in this case?

I can't figure out how to get the default Intellij JVM build tool to work, not much documentation on it. Have used Maven for Java - should I switch to Gradle?

I am having an issue with unreachable statement after my return statement. I am using firebase createUserWithEmailAndPassword method but it is unreachable because the code before returns true or false. They are two boolean methods which check if email and password are correct input and then return true or false.

I'm new to Kotlin and was wondering what people preferred to use. Especially interested in anything that supports fat jar for easy deployment.
