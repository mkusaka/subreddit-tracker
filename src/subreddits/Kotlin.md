Hi! I've started to learn the Kotlin language two weeks ago because I want to develop my first app. At first, I jumped right into coding a login start screen and include Firebase, but I don't understand some things and it became frustrating. After that, I've considered that it's best to start with the basics and try to structure the info in lessons. Usually, the best learning method for me is to take a quiz/test after finishing a "lesson". Can you recomend websites or apps where I can do this?

I want to be an android developer and  I'm interested in the language of Kotlin. Do I need to specialize in java before kotlin to make my career easier in 2020 and future? And what are the features an android developer should have in our time? What are the factors that make it easier to find a job?

I set up a simple Kotlin/Gradle project in IntelliJ, and when I select java8-openjdk oder java11-openjdk as the project SDK, then everything compiles and works fine. However, if I select Kotlin SDK (1.3.61), it fails with the following output: 

`22:09:22: Executing tasks ':classes :testClasses'...`

`22:09:22: Tasks execution finished ':classes :testClasses'.`

Why is this or should this even work? How can I fix this? Thanks!

Hi dudes
