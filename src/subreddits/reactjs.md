We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

How you deploy your project? Do you make separate project for front end and backend? Or make a same project for both?

GraphQL clients were discussed few times with the general notion that Apollo Client 2.x is inferior. Is this still the case with the 3.0 version? Did anyone already test thoroughly the 3.0 version?

Or is there anything better than urql and Apollo Client 3.0 to handle GQL on the client side?

In [notion.so](http://notion.so/) app you can create any element by hitting / and it will pop up a window with all types of options like heading box or image box or table box ..etc. How can I create something like that with ReactJs?
## [10][Help with authenticating a SAML 2.0 OpenAM token](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hfl67x/help_with_authenticating_a_saml_20_openam_token/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hfl67x/help_with_authenticating_a_saml_20_openam_token/
---
Hey guys, I know this probably isn't the best place to ask this but the nodejs sub is dead.

Essentially, my react app needs to consume a SAML 2.0 token coming from a client's IDP. I have an express server to do this. I am using passport-saml, but I'm not quite sure if this is even the right thing to use. I've never heard of SAML before this week. 

Can anyone please just let me know if I'm on the right track? As far as I can tell, the redirect is happening after the user authenticates, but when it comes back to my app it redirects back to sign in, so I assume I'm not properly authenticating the token.

Here is the snippet that I think is relevant, ANY help at all with this would be greatly appreciated, as I'm totally lost.

A  while back I saw a really neat project someone posted on Reddit where  they set up their UI to be interactive and for changes to the UI to  modify code. Unfortunately, I lost the link and tried to find it but  can't because I don't know what the title was or even what subreddit. I  was wondering if y'all could help me find it?
