I usually implement splash screen using theme with `android:windowBackground` set to the app icon. I was wondering if it is possible to use **AnimatedVectorDrawable** as the window background and make it's animation start automatically. I can use the **AnimatedVectorDrawable** as the background but it's animation won't start automatically.

## [6][Dependency management for locally built .aar](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iufrj2/dependency_management_for_locally_built_aar/)

Hello,  


if I build a local .aar file which has some dependencies and distribute it to people, they will have to add the same dependencies in their build.gradle file so the library doesn't crash upon usage.   
Is there any way to ship a list of my dependencies as a .pom file within my custom library alongside with the .aar file, so gradle knows which dependencies the project is using?  
Or is there any other way to solve this nicely, without having people changing their projects to match the dependencies within my library?  


I need this specifically for local usage of the library, not through maven publish plugin

## [8][Correct way to use dynamic feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/iui02g/correct_way_to_use_dynamic_feature/)

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

i am confused about usage of dynamic feature. I have been working on developing a new application. So I want to separate all of my feature to modules. I can do that with regular modules but as i read document of dynamic feature, it has lot of benefits. it provides these;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Faster build time

\-Enhancing refactoring

\-Improving process of development

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the most important one is faster build time for me. Therefore, i want to make all of my feature module to dynamic.

I have checked plaid example which is used dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

I am confused about Is it right approach to making all of your modules to dynamic also all of them will be install-time.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the disadvantages?

I can write one of disadvantages:

\-If you want to implement Dependency Injection such as Dagger. It would be hard and complex Or you can use Koin which is much more easy and understandable.

\- UI testing is hard to write; if your app has only dynamic feature, your instrumentation test must be isolated with which activity you test.

\- It is not enough to getting unit test coverage of application / or i couldn't find a way for that.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up, What do you think?

I completed the head first android book and also completed free basic course of udacity and google on android development but now I wanna go from intermediate to advance. So is there any book for that?

Hi everyone, i'm been coding in Java for a long time (around 8 years) and i think the change to Kotlin for Android Development is inevitable. 
My biggest problem is how to start the change, theres a lot of courses and YouTube videos but Is a little overwhelming.
Any tip for the most experienced in this?
