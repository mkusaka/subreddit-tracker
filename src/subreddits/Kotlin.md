I have quite an idea of what I want to do, but I don't have any experience with plotting libraries in any language. So I don't really know what I'm talking about.

I'd like to have some kind of tool (library or framework, most likely) that allows me to plot functions in a mathematical sense in Kotlin. I'd be interested in both 2d and 3d visualizations. A function in the mathematical sense would be anything that takes in a fixed amount of number-type arguments and puts out a fixed amount of number-type returns, for every set of arguments that you put in. And such a function should be plottable to a 2d or 3d graph with the traditional x, y (and z) axis.

I've found lets-plot for Kotlin, which seems to be more suitable for plotting certain visualizations based on a bunch of data, and not for plotting functions. But maybe I haven't looked into it deeply enough or I just don't understand what I am talking about (most likely).

Therefore any kind of help would be highly appreciated. What tool should I use and how would I plot a mathematical function with this tool?

Pretty much says it all in the title. Prior to 1.3 there was still a big effort to add more language features to kotlin. Now all I hear about is multi platform, and to be honest I couldn't care less about it. There's still some basic stuff (like multi-catch blocks) that we don't have in the language. I love kotlin but seriously come on now.

Hi all, this is my first post on this. I've been writing a book about Physics Algorithms (still fairly early)- how to do simulations. I'm aiming it at undergraduate physics students (who aren't necessarily good at programming), and computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and people with coding experience already.

I chose Kotlin for most of the algorithms in the book, and source code is presented too --- I did this because Kotlin is an amazing language for doing physics simulations in: it's fast, concise and easy to work with --- I would say that C and Python, although popular for this, are inadequate for teaching physics algorithms because C is too difficult to manage for largish projects, and python is too slow. I'm not expecting much disagreement on that here.

Anyway, so I'm looking for feedback or even just interest. Part of my reason to post this is to get the motivation to finish the book.

So if you're interested, the link is here:

[http://www.articlesbyaphysicist.com/book\_physics\_algorithm.html](http://www.articlesbyaphysicist.com/book_physics_algorithm.html)

And please do just leave a message here saying whether the idea is interesting, or whether you have definite feedback.

Bear in mind that it's early days, and I'll be adding a lot to this in all chapters.

Hi! I'm new to programming in Kotlin and I want know how you could clear the terminal. (I'm not using Android Studio)

code:

    fun clear() {
        // code to clear screen
    }
    
    fun main() {
        print("enter text: ")
        e = readLine()
        if (e == "clear") {
            clear()
        }
    }

Any help appreciated!

I would prefer it would direct me somehow toward mobile application development for Android.
