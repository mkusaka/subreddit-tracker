This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hi guys, I am creating an android launcher and I wonder, how is it possible to change the Overview screen?

I know the home button can be bound to an app and that creates the launcher, is it possible to bind the overview button too?

&amp;#x200B;

I started to learn Recyclerview in Kotlin and I see there are so many things to take care about, I'm new programming so I'm trying to figure out concepts like inflate, adapters, inheritance, etc.

Can you suggest an order of things to understand and use Recyclerviews?

Hi everyone, 

I have a question. I'm an editor of a newsletter that is dedicated to the last developments in machine learning. A lot of our subscribers are data scientists but I also noticed that a lot of software engineers and developers started to sign up recently. Would you be so kind to check it and give me your feedback about how such newsletter might be useful for you? 

Here is a link to the weekly free newsletter:

And here is a link to deeper, more educational content that helps to really build and reinforce knowledge about machine learning:

I am going to take [this](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native) course, but I feel kinda hesitant since it says Mobile App Development not Android.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I know python, you could say I'm an intermediate, and a little bit of C.

Thanks in advance
