I want to achieve SEO visibility for my React application. It consists of a few HTML pages which content doesn't change and is not dynamic. I can use [server side rendering (SSR), pre-rendering and static site generators (SSG)](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-universal-rendering).

In this case, SSR would be an overkill and I can choose between pre-rendering or SSG. Which one should I choose?

When is it better to use [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) instead of [react-static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static) or [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)?

As a total beginner I want to use React to build a data visualization interface, which I can share directly with my clients. Any feedback is appreciated!

1) What's the best way to learn React? Textbooks, Youtube, other sources? 

2) How long does it take to become proficient in React assuming prior intermediate level coding knowledge? 

3) Can I accomplish my goal without learning React? I came across Plotly Dash but it's not free for commercial use. How is your experience with plotly Dash? Are there any other similar products out there?

Hi,

I am just curious why hooks can not be called conditionally. I have started using hooks in my components and have not had issues following the rules. I would like to understand better why the rules are the way they are. Thanks.

## [12][Electron (builded) app failing to initiate on "/" route](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g1548k/electron_builded_app_failing_to_initiate_on_route/)

---
When on development server, or when using the builded version through the browser, my electron app works properly, but when launching the app  through the .exe it always starts in the 404 route (actually in no route at all). Do I have to set up some kind of initial route parameter or something like that? I'm using react-router-dom v5.
