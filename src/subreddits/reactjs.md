We alternate between **Who's Hiring** (on the 1st of the month, [most recent one here][hiring:most recent]) and **Who's Available** (on the 15th, [most recent one here][available:most recent])

Welcome to **the biggest React job board in the world!** This is like Hacker News' **Who's Hiring** but just for React. Top Level comments must be **Job Opportunities.**

‚ö†Ô∏è NEW: WE ARE REQUESTING EVERYBODY FOLLOW [THE HN Who's Hiring FORMAT][format:hiring:hn]

**Company inc. | Job Title | City/State Location | Full-time/Part-Time | On-site/Remote | (Optional) Salary range | Website jobs page, other hard requirements etc.**

examples:

- **Thorn | San Francisco or Remote (US based) | Full-time Contract | $100k - $150k | Software Engineer | https://www.wearethorn.org/**
- **PolicyStat | Full-Stack Python+Django Software Engineer | Indianapolis, Vancouver, or REMOTE | Full Time | +\$80k**

Please include as much information as possible. **If you are remote-friendly, or open to sponsoring work visas to your country, say so! These are the top 2 questions!**

If you are looking for jobs, send a PM to the poster or post in our [Who's Available thread!][available:most recent]  
(I am sorry folks. I didn't post 'Who's Available' for October...)

Hi!  
I've recently made an Udemy course about state machines with XState and React :)  
If you are new to finite state machines' concepts or if you have ever heard about state machines, but you have no clue what is that about, then go and check this tutorial.

## [7][Hey guys! I created a complete MERN stack boilerplate repo, which can be cloned and used to quickly bootstrap projects.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jnji8q/hey_guys_i_created_a_complete_mern_stack/)

I  put this repo together as a helper for me to quickly bootstrap projects  instead of writing out the same code over and over, and figured it  might be useful to some of you here to either use in your own projects,  or to study and see how this is built. If you have any questions, feel  free to comment or PM me.

Built with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

Additional contributors/suggestions very welcome!
