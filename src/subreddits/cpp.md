Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely (permanently, or for the duration of the pandemic)? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

This is my first public cpp library, it is \~300 line of code (i think it is easy to read).

I would like to have your feedback on it ðŸ˜‹.

Why? So it can minimize fragmentation + os already is sttoring some meta data about the page might as well store a flag + a pointer to indicate that current page is a part of something  
But i dont know if it can so im asking it here

SwedenCpp used the meetup free corona time to improve the website

* What upcoming C++ meetups are scheduled around the world?  
visit [https://www.swedencpp.se/worldwide](https://www.swedencpp.se/worldwide)
* What new C++ blogs are available?  
visit [https://www.swedencpp.se/blogs](https://www.swedencpp.se/blogs)
* What new C++ videos have been uploaded?  
visit [https://www.swedencpp.se/videos](https://www.swedencpp.se/videos)
* What new C++ user group talks have been made public?  
visit [https://www.swedencpp.se/ugvideos](https://www.swedencpp.se/ugvideos)

Originally, only meetups for the Swedish meetup groups have been shown, but during the last weeks, several content collections have been added, and I think this can be a nice overview for a lot of people.

Please note that only info is shown that can be collected automated.  Therefore it shows less, but always up to date and nearly in real time (just some minutes delay), content to what is already available on the isocpp website or the meetingcpp website, or here on reddit.

If you think anything is missing, please inform the maintainer.

In search for lazy evaluation I found [this project on codeproject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/682455/Generic-Lazy-Evaluation-in-Cplusplus), which missed thread safety, though.  
I replaced the `std::function` member with a `std::shared_future` and use `std::async` with `std::launch::deferred` to get a lazy evaluated threadsafe class:

Is c++ the best language to program my first game ? How long will that take ? Any learning sources ? Should I count more on books or online videos ? Any recommendations? 
Thank you ( ;
