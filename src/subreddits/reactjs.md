I just did that and it seems to be very similar to webpack 4.  Bundle size decreased by 0.5%, build time remains similar.  Besides module federation which I don't use, and opt-in persistent caching that seem to bebetter left off, what's the biggest feature I can tell my boss/coworker? I went through the changelog and couldn't fully appreciate the technical changes that are being made.

If you are planning to migrate, be prepared to deal with a bunch of config migrations, adding node polyfills, getting a lot more webpack api warnings and dealing with some incompatible webpack plugins :)

Hi,

I have a form in ReactJS, after submit, form data is posted to django backend.

My requirement is, I¬†need to run data analysis and visualization on submitted form data with data already exists from¬† previous submitted data.

can I build data visualization in Django Rest Framework?. or can I do data analysis and visualization in Pandas library?. But not sure how to build an API so that I can show up these data visualization to ReactJS ui after form submit.

Please let me know , if any sample or reference to github project, will be helpful.

Thanks,

Hi I'm a month in learning react and this is my first attempt at a fully working component

&amp;#x200B;

It's an input element that lets you select time slots along the week days
