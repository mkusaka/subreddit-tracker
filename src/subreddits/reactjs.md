I'm creating a website with a static page and a dashboard for a relative's work, using NextJs. For the dashboard I obviously need authentication but I'm having a small problem.

How do I create a default user, I can manually create the user on the database but I do need to encrypt the password. I could just run a script once to add it but I did some search and I saw someone saving default users on a JSON file and then use that to populate the database. The part I don't understand is where to run that file, in an express app I could just require the file in this case I don't know. I'm thinking maybe I could find a way to do a postbuild hook or something (using Vercel for deployment).

What do you guys think it's the best way to handle this ?
