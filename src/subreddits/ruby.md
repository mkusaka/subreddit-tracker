Hi!

I posted some gameplay videos of my [open source platformer game](https://victords.itch.io/super-bombinhas) on YouTube, please check it out: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDF29vao7Xur\_mTS4NFRviA/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDF29vao7Xur_mTS4NFRviA/videos)

The videos started with "NEW" are from the current version of the project. There's also a video from a past version from many years ago.

Thanks!

I'm trying to create a pomodoro timer in order to help myself learn and to create something useful for myself. I was wondering what the best gem(s) for creating a graphical interface would be (Gtk vs Qt, for example) and I also want to be able to have an event triggered when the timer is up, but while the application is still running and you can interact with other timers for example. 

How should I go about this? Any resources or help are appreciated.
