## [2][Multi-tenant Serverless Web App: How to deal with AWS credentials?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/i73klb/multitenant_serverless_web_app_how_to_deal_with/)

I'm building a multi-tenant serverless web app, fully on top of AWS services. I'm also adopting a "pooled" architecture.

This architecture means:

1. Services will run on **Lambdas**, which will have execution roles scoped to the service.
2. Users will federate using **Cognito**, and within the service Lambdas they will retrieve **temporary AWS security credentials** using [AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html) (by STS), sending a [session policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/create-fine-grained-session-permissions-using-iam-managed-policies/) as parameter to scope permissions down to tenant access.

The second item above means that federated users will assume a role (pre-built on IAM), and on top of that, a dynamically created “session policy” will be added, scoping the resulting AWS credential's access down to tenant level resource minutia (like DynamoDB tenant rows and S3 tenant tags).

With that in mind, I have two questions

1. **Will the temporary security credentials generated by STS substitute the Lambda's execution role (thus invalidating it), or will the Lambda's execution role still apply?**
2. **Once I retrieve the temporary security credentials (access keys + security token) from STS, how should I store them for subsequent requests made by that Lambda for that user?**  
(I don't want to have to generate new credentials on every single request, I want to use them until they expire, which is 1h by default)

Getting a persistant address to a ECS Fargate Container should be easy, right? Well, it’s not. [This article](https://medium.com/@niclasgustafsson/getting-a-persistant-address-to-a-ecs-fargate-container-3df5689f6e56?source=friends_link&amp;sk=e7ac1a36513129ee4da52cf24db8293f) explains how to do it.

I saw some of the web sockets examples uses DynamoDB, but is it possible to use RDS Database(postgresql) instead of it?

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to have history of my data, and I am confused with the Write request units and Read request units of the dynamodb so I can't fully used the dynamodb to its full potential.

Hi, guys!

As a way to learn python and interact with AWS, I created this project to bring some reports of services that I usually use, such as security groups, iam, s3, etc. The project aims to bring resources that are not being used, or that may have been configured in the wrong way. I would like feedback as to the code and whether the tool would have any real use. Greetings!

Is there something like FaunaDb on AWS, basically a Serverless JSON Database strap-on some magic GraphQL API endpoint.

Writing my own Lambda Functions (in REST) with Serverless RDS seems like a step backwards.

Love AWS

What do you guys recommend for a S3 desktop browser that is multithreaded and fast? I've been using cloudberry explorer but this $40/PC fee is getting old.
