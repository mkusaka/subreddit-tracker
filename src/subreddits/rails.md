What would you recommend for a good, Rails-tailored hosting plan (like Heroku) for around $7-8 per month? That is what my client told me she would like to pay. Heroku Hobby is $7, but is that good enough for a production e-commerce site?

If not, what else would you recommend? I'd like something like Heroku that is specifically tailored to Rails where you can push your code from GitHub and it works. I tried and failed to deploy my app to Digital Ocean's Rails droplet (and I'm far from being a noob when it comes to the Linux CLI).

Howdy.

Is there a way of preserving focus state? My use case is that I want the "new" form to autosave with a debounce, and once it saves it should become the "edit" form of the saved entry. I can manually replace the history state but I think that it would be cool to get it for free from Turbolinks, almost like Inertia.

I'm building a Rails app that consumes an API that accepts this header.

&gt; "The server then determines based on these headers if the client's cached copy is the most recent version of this file. If so, the server returns an HTTP status 304 code, letting the client know it can reuse its cached copy."

But I don't know if I understand the idea, does this mean I have to always save the result of each API request to a file or database? and if the request's result has an HTTP status 304 should I rescue it from the database? What if I don't have the result in the database? Do I send you a request without that header to get the result again?

I really love vs code and use it even though it takes a lot of memory. I recently started getting my feet wet with vim and have learned some movements in it. So I use the vscode vim plugin to move within the file using vim motions. Honestly, it's a good intro to vim motions even though sometimes the extension crashes.

I huge drawback is finding where the method being used is defined, and to fo to the definition and find all references to a method. I use ruby and solargraph extensions but it doesn't work most of the time in non-framework code and take a huge amount of time even if it does so. Anybody has any suggestions to work within vs-code.   


Other than that I use go-to-spec which easily gets you to the spec file and vice versa. 

and end-wise which adds end to your method but doesn't work that well. 

Any other extension which you believe is of great use?

Also is it possible to key the rails application running and infer the method definition and other information since most of the things are runtime?

Hey everyone!

I have recently finished my tutorial on building a ruby on rails based tracker. My videos assume no knowledge of the rails framework and teach how to get started whilst building a simple projects.

If you are interested starting out with ruby on rails with a cool project this is the place for you!

Hi everyone

I have a task that I run via Sidekiq + ActiveJob + Redis. The task is a collection of ActiveRecord instances with a one to many relation to another model which performs updates on the "to many" table for each "belongs\_to". Is it considered best practice to have a single task for it in a loop or should I break it down to multiple smaller tasks to be put on queue?

Thanks
