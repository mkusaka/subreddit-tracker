Hey,

I am pretty new to Rails, so don't judge me ;) Basically I want to select the article's category using collection\_select. As I understand collection\_select gives me string and I need it to be an object of category Model how do I go about doing it? Does collection\_select have some feature for it or do I need to create my own methods to get the category object by id?

So... on the premise of keeping things as clean and consistent as possible, is there any value to adding font awesome into your application via gem or w/e other options are available as opposed to the link in application.html.erb? I feel kind of guilty just pasting a 3rd party link there and using it app-wide.

I have a def in `user.rb` to check if the user (logged) is online.

I use it in views just checking `&lt;% if u/user.online? %&gt;`

I can also check which is the last movie-page watched by the user, because in `user.rb` I have also this

    has_many :visited_movies, -&gt; { distinct }, through: :visits, source: :movie

Now I want to create a new feature on my website.

In the Movie Pages **I want to show how many logged users are watching now that page**.

I should use the previous datas, right?

How to do? I don't know how to start
## [7][Best way to update two records based on each others values.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/gkto3w/best_way_to_update_two_records_based_on_each/)

Hi, I have two 'Creature' records and I would like to perform a calculation based on both records' stats, and then update both records.

This is my current Creatures controller:

    def hunt
        predator = Creature.find(params[:id])
        prey = Creature.find(predator.prey)
        @predator = predator.hunt_predator
        @prey = prey.hunt_prey
    end

And here is a snippet from my Creature model:

    def hunt_prey
        prey = self.clone
        prey.population = prey.population*0.8
        prey.save!
    end

My challenge is that the model changes the records irrespective of the other creatures stats. Is there a way of calling the `predator.hunt_predator` model that takes the other record as input so I can modify both?

Alternatively, am I approaching this in a non-Rails way, and is there a much better practice way of doing this?

Looking online I found a lot of suggestions to use `Creature.update_all`, but couldn't find anything for running the calculations using both records as input. I've considered running the calculations in the controller and then using `Creature.update_all` but I know having a bloated controller is bad practice.

Thanks so much for the help, I'm very new to Rails and been stumped on this for weeks.

Hey guys, I wanna deploy my first rails app into production this week or next week in GCP, before going do this I wanna know the common issues when you deploy to production and how to fix that?


In my Rails app, I am using Active Storage with GCP bucket, Whenever Cron for run rake task, Rbenv, Delayed Job, PostgreSql, I saw some articles how to deploy to Ubuntu server , and there are some ways to deploy 
From using Mina, Passenger , Unicorn, and Capistrano. Which you use for this ? And if we use this gem to help us to deploy , would it make issue on the things I use in my Rails app like active job , active storage , or else ? And will make some more configuration for it ??
Thank you for attention
