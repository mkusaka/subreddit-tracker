Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I just want my c++ code to compile, i do not understand what to do. Can someone give me a link or template. I am very frustrated as i can't find a single resource online to help me.

I just saw someone do `for(n : v) {...}` where `v` is an initialized `std::vector`. I've been doing the full `for (int i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); i++) {...}` thing since I started programming years ago. I feel like I should get reading :)

Back in July of 2017 I started posting a series of videos under the premise that "teaching is the best way to learn."  The premise what that I would read through the book "Game Programming In C++ Start To Finish" written by Erik Yuzwa and then adapt the information from said book into a video format. I now know that this was a terrible, terrible idea.

The code in the book was practically unusable., the software was out of date, and the version of OpenGL that it was using was already depreciated by the time I started my videos. I knew this going in. I further knew that attempting to get into game development via learning to program a game engine is the dumbest and hardest possible way to do so.

But I thought then, and I still think now, that my game ideas don't properly fit in any framework provided by current engines. I now know that I could have simply make a scaled down version of my ideas, refined them, learned how to code, and THEN learned how to make an engine that fit their needs, but at this point I'm 10 years in and I'm not backing down now. 

So here's what I'm here to ask. If you have some spare time, could you give some or all the my tutorial series a watch, and tell me just how badly I messed everything up?

I'm looking for critiques like "this part was to fast" "this part was to slow" "To little information given here" "Should have mentioned where you got this or that resource" "Should have sited your sources for this" etc.

All the criticisms will be cataloged along with my own criticisms of myself into a postmortem video. Then. Well. Then I'm going to try again. With a new book this time. One that I think will actually help me this time: Game Engine Architecture 2nd Edition by Jason Gregory. Also, if you have other books that you know to be excellent resources for building a good cross-platform game engine in C++, let me know so I can take a look at them. Also if there are any other series that cover the same topics, let me know about that too. I'll also be looking at the lists of books and series that already exist on this subreddit and others. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!

I am learning C++. In C, I can type `man function_name` and get a concise but helpful reference of a function.

I tried `stdman` which is a man page version of cppreference website. It is nowhere near C man pages which neatly give function signature, arguments and return value. (maybe partly because C functions are simple and no templating). Compared to them, stdman or whatever C++ reference is horrible. Moreover, it is hard to get complete information about a function like std::string::copy() (Maybe I am missing something here though).

similarly, in python also, documentation was one help() away in interpreter. Is there an analogue for C++? I don't need to see all possibilities with the function or heck, not even complete type signature. For some example:

    std::find(iterator m, iterator n, value) - find given element in given collection

I will not be learning function from scratch every time, I just need it to remind me.

if you know something like that, please comment.
## [10][Refactoring generates so many new source files](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/et0t56/refactoring_generates_so_many_new_source_files/)

I'm adding unit tests to a couple of codebases which haven't had them before.  To break dependencies I'm factoring out interfaces (base classes with only pure virtual functions) for each class's collaborators.

**This generates so. many. new. files.**

C++ already averages 2x as many files as classes because of the .h/.cpp split.  Now I have 4x as many files as (concrete) classes.  I'm not even counting test mocks, I'm talking just in the core project.

I don't really want to put the interfaces in the same .h file as the concrete classes, because declaring the interface in its own file allows me to strip out #include's if they were only necessary to the concrete implementation but not needed by the interface class.

I could eliminate the .cpp file for the interface, but I'm using those to define the pure virtual destructors.  Also to follow John Lakos's advice that every class / header should be included in a corresponding .cpp file even if the .cpp file otherwise has nothing to do.  (It provides assurances the header is correct and self-sufficient.)

One of my projects is a legacy MFC app.  In order to disentangle the business logic from the presentation logic from the Lovecraftian horror of Windows programming I'm splitting every dialog class into a view, presenter, and model.  But that's 3x the files.  Most need interfaces, so 2x3.  Count .h/.cpp and you have 2x2x3 = 12 files per dialog.

Twelve.

Times 50 dialogs.

**How am I supposed to keep this shit organized?**

I mean, it is what it is.  I'm just looking for assurances before I go on a tear doing a refactoring that turns 100 code files into 600 code files that I'm not missing something here.
