I've never done any deployment of ML models online? So what would you say is the main reason people use Sagemaker? Is the processing capacity or the ability to serve to algorithm to other users?

Iâ€™m just playing around with AWS... Is it possible to use a cloud server as a domain controller? Iâ€™ve spun up the server and configured AD but donâ€™t know where to go from here. I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s possible. Help?

I would like to register a second U2F key as a backup for my root user account.  I don't see a way to do this without removing my existing key through the "Manage" option.  Backup keys are recommended in case the primary U2F key fails.  Is there a way to do this?

So i was setting up the django project on aws ec2 instance with the apache2 server everything was working until I tried to upload something to the static folder I checked the aws logs and it says permission denied /static I searched thoroughly on the stackoverflow forum and nothing was able to resolve the issue then I read somewhere that in django if we keep debug true the static folder is handled by the django itself I tried turning it off and now there is no permission denied error in apache error logs but the website is giving a server error and there is nothing uploaded in the static folder too. It is working perfectly in the local development or when I run it locally on a port in aws but when I use apache it is showing this error . I am not able to pinpoint the error or how to proceed from here if someone can get me to the right direction it will be very helpful

Hello everyone, I am currently researching whether I can create an AWS Lex chat Bot and deploy it on Zoom? Wondering if anyone has been able to do this or if itâ€™s possible at all? I did read their developer guide and it shows the only deployment options as mobile using their aws sdk, Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Twilio. 

Thanks in advance, happy to have joined the community ðŸ˜Š
## [9][Python Lambda Deployment Package](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hxpc6t/python_lambda_deployment_package/)

I was looking to get some information about deployment packages and AWS Lambda. I'm looking at the following Github Repo:   


[https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-python-audio-player/tree/master/SingleStream](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-python-audio-player/tree/master/SingleStream?fbclid=IwAR3Q9HAeV4UpsSd5CxNOC-8P1l4wCICGUd14gusOIY9ZNKptQTMeUW7BZM0)  


The instructions are clear, you need to modify certain parameters and eventually you need to create a deployment package for Lambda. I'm wondering which files need to be contained within the deployment package out of the repo? Clearly you need to put in the lambda function and the site packages, but what about the other files within the repo?
## [10][lambda@edge function invocation location ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hxszs7/lambdaedge_function_invocation_location/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hxszs7/lambdaedge_function_invocation_location/

According to [cloudfront documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/), lambda@edge is triggered near the user but doesn't mention if it is invocated at an edge location or a regional edge cache location. This information is a prerequisite for the design of my solution. Can anybody help me out ?
