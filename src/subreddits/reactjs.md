## [8][Use TailwindCSS base styles in your emotion CSS-in-JS project](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fsx4g5/use_tailwindcss_base_styles_in_your_emotion/)

Hi everybody,

As my first post in this community I'd like to introduce you into a small library I've published recently.

You might know the issues with having some default CSS base styles in every browser:

* They are inconsistent over different browsers
* They probably do not align with your design system
* They just look a little oldschool

There are various base style reset libraries out there. Personally, I like the opinionated base styles used by TailwindCSS the most. That's why I have created a small library to easily incorporate the TailwindCSS base styles into Emotion CSS-in-JS projects!

Check it out (and leave a star if you like it üôÇ):

This is going to be an unusual amount of code because I am trying to share everything that is going on here. What I am trying to do is in a list, mark services as complete. When it's complete, it changes the colour of the service and then hides that service. Also, there's a button to show the hidden services.

I manage to hide each individual service OK. But cannot work with the button that hides/shows ALL of the completed services.

I have a context provider:

`const ContextProviderBooking = ({ children }) =&gt; {`

`const [isHidden, setIsHidden] = useState(false); //sharing among both components to hide/show list`

`return &lt;ContextBooking.Provider value={{ isHidden, setIsHidden }}&gt;`

`{children}`

`&lt;/ContextBooking.Provider&gt;`

`}`

`export { ContextBooking, ContextProviderBooking }`

Each 'Booking' component has a button that marks the service as complete. This happen by conditionally changing the class of each component. This works fine

`const Booking = (props) =&gt; {`

  `const [isHidden, setIsHidden] = useState(props.isHidden)`

  `console.log(props.isHidden) // will output true or false 16 times(there are 16 component in total)`

  `const [isCompleted, setIsCompleted] = useState(props.completed);`

  `return (`

  `&lt;li`

`className={`

`isCompleted &amp;&amp; isHidden ? 'booking-complete hide' //class names are not changing individually`

`: isCompleted ? 'booking-complete' //if button is pressed on one of them,`

`: 'booking' //it may affect the other`

`}`

`key={`[`props.id`](https://props.id)`}`

`id={`[`props.id`](https://props.id)`}&gt;`

`&lt;h3&gt;{`[`props.date`](https://props.date)`}&lt;/h3&gt;`

`&lt;h4&gt;{props.time}&lt;/h4&gt;`

`&lt;h5&gt;{`[`props.name`](https://props.name)`}&lt;/h5&gt;`

`&lt;button`

`onClick={() =&gt; { //shouldn't this button work of each li and not sometimes all of them?` 

`if (!isCompleted &amp;&amp; !isHidden) {`

`setIsCompleted(!isCompleted); //this changes color of the service as className changes`

`setTimeout(() =&gt; setIsHidden(!isHidden), 200) //after a short time it is hidden`

`}`

`else if (isCompleted &amp;&amp; !isHidden) {`

`setIsCompleted(!isCompleted);`

`}`

`else {`

`setIsCompleted(!isCompleted);`

`setIsHidden(!isHidden);`

`}`

`}}&gt;`

`{!isCompleted ? \`Completed\` : \`Not complete\`}\`

`&lt;/button&gt;`

`&lt;/li&gt;`

`)`

`}`

Then I am rendering each of the services in a larger component called 'Bookings'

`const Bookings = () =&gt; {`

`const { isHidden, setIsHidden } = useContext(ContextBooking)`

`const display = day =&gt; //function that displays each service according to the day it was booked for`

`allBookings.map( //allBookings is a json file`

   `item =&gt;`

  [`item.day`](https://item.day) `=== day &amp;&amp; (`

`&lt;Booking`

`isHidden={isHidden}`

`completed={item.completed} //comes from json file, all default to false`

`key={`[`item.id`](https://item.id)`}`

`id={`[`item.id`](https://item.id)`}`

`time={item.time}`

`name={`[`item.name`](https://item.name)`}`

`date={`[`item.date`](https://item.date)`}`

`/&gt;`

`)`

`)`

`return (`

`&lt;div className="bookings"&gt;`

`&lt;h2 className="ib"&gt;Next bookings&lt;/h2&gt;`

`&lt;button`

`onClick={() =&gt;{ //This won't work.`

`setIsHidden(!isHidden);}`

`}&gt;`

`Show hidden`

`&lt;/button&gt;`

`&lt;h2&gt;Today&lt;/h2&gt;`

`&lt;ul&gt; {display('today')} &lt;/ul&gt;`

`&lt;h2&gt; Tomorrow &lt;/h2&gt;`

`&lt;ul&gt; {display('tomorrow')} &lt;/ul&gt;`

`&lt;h2&gt; General &lt;/h2&gt;`

`&lt;ul&gt; {display('other')} &lt;/ul&gt;`

`&lt;/div&gt;`

`)`

`}`

## [12][Firebase cloud functions CORS policy error](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fsw405/firebase_cloud_functions_cors_policy_error/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fsw405/firebase_cloud_functions_cors_policy_error/

Hey there, I'm nearly pulling my hair out on this one.

I am working off a create-react-app project and am needing to call firebase cloud function but am getting this error:

`Access to fetch at '`[`https://us-central1-careerhub-a50a2.cloudfunctions.net/createUser`](https://us-central1-careerhub-a50a2.cloudfunctions.net/createUser)`' from origin '`[`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)`' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.`

Server-side code looks like this:

`const functions = require('firebase-functions');`  
`const admin = require('firebase-admin');`  
`admin.initializeApp();`  


`exports.createUser = functions.https.onCall((data, context) =&gt; {`  
 `const email = data.email`  
 `const password = data.password`  
 `return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {`  
 `admin.auth().createUser({`  
 `email: email,`  
 `emailVerified: false,`  
 `password: password`  
`}).then(resolve).catch((err) =&gt; {`  
 `console.error(err.code)`  
 `reject(new functions.https.HttpsError(err.code, err.message))`  
`})`  
`})`  
`})`

&amp;#x200B;

Client-side:

`const handleAddUser = () =&gt; {`  
 `let pswd = passwordGen(7)`  
 `firebase.functions().httpsCallable('createUser')({email: email, password: pswd}).then((response) =&gt; {`  
 `console.log(response)`  
`}).catch((error) =&gt; {`  
 `console.log(error)`  
`})`  
   `}`  


This is probably a silly mistake on my end...but I'd be eternally grateful if you could put me out of my misery. :)
