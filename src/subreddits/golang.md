[Go Playground App](https://reddit.com/link/fb0j6d/video/we1nmf77zpj41/player)

I made an [app](https://github.com/spencerchurchill/GoPlayground) which wraps play.golang.org in a Flutter app.

It is currently on the Google Play Store and, if well received, will be on Apple's as well.

I was hoping to hear some opinions about this app and promote its existence.

Thank you all in advance! :)
## [10][How do you protect your Go cloud functions from cyber attacks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/fbacy8/how_do_you_protect_your_go_cloud_functions_from/)

When you deploy Go cloud functions, what security measures do you take to prevent cyber attacks? My knowledge of cyber security is very limited, so I'm just thinking about using middleware functions to counter dos, ddos, and man-in-the-middle attacks? Not really sure what else there is to think about other than encryption (I am using go-alone instead of JWT). Any guidance is appreciated.
