We’ll be joined by other developers and team leads from Kotlin, as well as two special guests: Wojtek Kaliciński /u/wkalicinski from Google and Sebastien Deleuze /u/sdeleuze from Spring.

On October 12–15 we hosted the [Kotlin 1.4 Online Event](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/event-14/), and over the course of those four days we received many interesting questions. Since we did not manage to cover all of them due to time constraints, we will answer them in a specific thread under this post.

Please post your questions as top-level comments to this post.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Hi guys,

I will be joining a new company where we will build a project depends on Microservices Architecture with Kafka server  (we will use Spring Boot as a framework)

I am looking for a good resource, since I have been searching for a while, but not able to find something that attracts my intention.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help ?
## [5][Trying to get property reference from a type given by function receiver](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jhr1au/trying_to_get_property_reference_from_a_type/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jhr1au/trying_to_get_property_reference_from_a_type/

I'm making a builder for any class. It's based on KProperty reflections and it works well for now, but I want to improve an interface of it. Here is an example of current usage:

    data class Data(
        val nonDef: String,
        val defValue: String = "DEF_VALUE",
        val copyValue: String = nonDef,
        val nonDef2: String,
        val aMap: Map&lt;String, String&gt; = emptyMap(),
    ) 
    
    val builtData = Builder&lt;Data&gt;() 
        .assign(Data::aMap, mapOf("key" to "value")) 
        .assign(Data::nonDef2, "10") 
        .assign(Data::nonDef, "10") 
        .build()
    

I don't like, that I have to specify Data:: receiver for every property reference in assign method. Data class is already given as generic for Builder, so I can pass only reference with receiving Data class.

So, I want to make new function prettyAssign() with callable argument, where class reference receiver  is passed as function receiver for callable, so I could address ::aMap, ::nonDef and ::nonDef2 to implicit 'this'. Here how it would look like:

    class Builder&lt;T : Any&gt;(val kClass: KClass&lt;T&gt;) {
        fun &lt;K&gt; assign(prop: KProperty1&lt;T, K&gt;, value: K)
            : Builder&lt;T&gt; = TODO("doing all reflection magic here")
            
        fun &lt;K&gt; prettyAssign(call: KClass&lt;T&gt;.() -&gt; Pair&lt;KProperty1&lt;T, K&gt;, K&gt;) {
            val (prop, value) = call(kClass)
            return assign(prop, value)
        }
    }
    
    val builtData = DataBuilder&lt;Data&gt;()
        .prettyAssign { ::aMap to mapOf("key" to "value") }
        .prettyAssign { ::nonDef2 to "10" }
        .prettyAssign { ::nonDef to "10" }
        .build()
    

In that approach it doesn't work, because KClass&lt;T&gt; doesn't have references to T properties.

So, I don't understand, is there a way to make prettyAssign() working

## [8][How to create a fat jar for Kotlin Multiplatform project without main class?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jhh0hc/how_to_create_a_fat_jar_for_kotlin_multiplatform/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jhh0hc/how_to_create_a_fat_jar_for_kotlin_multiplatform/

 Hello! 

I'm trying to create fat jar for my kotlin multiplatform project which will then be used as a dependency on another project. When I'm trying to use the class defined in the multiplatform project on the other project, it's not able to find/import it. However, when I opened the created jar, I can see it's there (along with all the dependencies).

There is a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62770101) that I found on how to build a fat jar for multiplatform project and I pretty much just followed that. Correct me if I'm wrong, since my multiplatform project doesn't have a main class, I do not need to include the part where it adds the main class to the attributes.

I have been having hard time to get this to work. Most of the examples online are for multiplatform projects with main class. Is there any tutorial on how to build a fat jar for a multiplatform project that doesn't have main class? Any help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
