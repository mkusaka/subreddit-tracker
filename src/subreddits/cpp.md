Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

## [2][Why is an r/cpp mod collecting feedback about r/cpp off twitter rather than asking for that feedback r/cpp](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j7wigk/why_is_an_rcpp_mod_collecting_feedback_about_rcpp/)

In the last few days we have been plunged into a controversy that has nothing to do with what this sub used to be about. First a mod posted a video and locked the thread using a very condescending sentence to make it sound like somehow we are all needing some lecturing, while deleting any other threads about it. Thankfully the decision was reverted, and once the cat was out of the bag, a new thread was allowed to be created where people would be allowed to discuss the matter.

It seems clear to me, *that most users of this sub are sympathetic to case of inclusion*, but it doesn't mean we are keen in seeing this sort of content being pushed through the sub, considering how heated it can become, while others made clear they at least disagree with the methods proposed to address this issue (myself included).

Now, **the same mod has asked his social circle in twitter to send feedback to the moderation channel about how they feel about r/cpp this precisely after locking the thread posted in this sub**. I think this is very unethical, as an attempt to certainly prejudice the feedback to be according to the sort of opinions he has surrounded himself with in twitter, while excluding all the other users of this sub who happened to participate on the thread but are not on his circle of friends.

I have said this before in reply to the mod in question: his behaviour is not transparent and frankly quite an insult to many of the users in this sub.

I'm gonna tag u/cleroth here to review this, but I think all the mods in this sub ought to question this sort of behaviour.

edit: To the claim this is about feedback from those who've left this sub, if you look on the tweet made, you're gonna see the request being made to active users who are his friends to send negative feedback about the sub. Coincidently, these users happened to be on the minority of a discussion had on the last few days in this sub. I think I've my point clear.

edit 2: There's evidence already presented in the comments, that accords with what I've heard from others, that this mod is working alongside specific communities to prejudice the collection of feedback by work alongside a specific political group. I rest my case.

So this is what this is all about:

Hello guys, normally I would join some conference in real. In my workplace I have a dedicated budget for training/self-development.  Nowadays I have no clue how to utilize it.  Can you recommend any good trainings, conferences in 2020 in Europe?

Once again there is a question "Does anyone know what is the status of XXX proposal?" posted on this subreddit. Myself, I had such a question about different proposals many times, and always found it hard to answer. The information seems to be all over the place - reddit posts, meeting reports, mailing lists... I think there is a dire need for system, where one can find all ongoing / closed proposals with their statuses, current revisions, and links to all the previous revisions. One could argue, that papers on http://www.open-std.org/ have all the information, but it is impossible to:
- find the newest revision of given paper,
- search for any particular paper, without knowing the year it was published,
- filter papers by subgroups / topics,
- there is no easy to find information, that the paper got rejected, abandoned etc. there only is an information, if the paper got adopted.

I think there is a need for website (maybe community-driven/created?) with all that information. Maybe also as a forum for discussion on certain proposals, rather than obscure mailing lists. Is it only me, or do anyone else thinks the same?
