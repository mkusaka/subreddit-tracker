Just want to ask a question about flexbox and grid layout.

I see some articles says combine flexbox and grid is correct the best solution of CSS layout  
.

But from what I can see, grid can do everything that flexbox can do, may I ask whether there is any case flexbox is better than grid?

## [8][Shouldn't I create Row, Col components for the grid?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hl1jtx/shouldnt_i_create_row_col_components_for_the_grid/)

I went to an interview and did a code test, the reviewer said the only part he does like my code is I had a Grid.tsx file includes Row, Col components. 

In my code, in src/components/Grid.txs file, I have two components Row and Col like

```
export const Row: React.FC&lt;IRowProps&gt; = (props) =&gt; {
   // ...
}
```
and
```
export const Col: React.FC&lt;IColProps&gt; = (props) =&gt; {
   // ...
}
```

And in my other components, I can layout elements by
```
&lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Col unit={1}&gt;
    &lt;Col unit={2}&gt;
&lt;/Row&gt;
```

He said it's over-structured, I should just use flexbox to do that instead of having a separate component, may I ask whether I did it wrong, or it's just his personal preference?

Thanks for any opinion. I just want to learn what's the correct way and improve. I am really confused now.

## [12][Meet Astrale, the open source astrology app I've made with React Native and Expo (Python + Mongo)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/hl0bjb/meet_astrale_the_open_source_astrology_app_ive/)

Good morning!

These last months I have been developing an application with React Native + Expo. It's not that I like astrology, it was just an excuse to play with Python (For scraping) and NoSQL with Mongo. And also to learn more React and more Native!

Here you have the repo:

[https://github.com/jvidalv/astrale](https://github.com/jvidalv/astrale)

You can run it on your device with Expo on this link:

[https://expo.io/@vidalv/astrale](https://expo.io/@vidalv/astrale)

Apple is not accepting  more astrology "apps" in iOs (Nice monopoly you are creating there Apple), so its only for download in Android PlayStore.

I hope you like it!
