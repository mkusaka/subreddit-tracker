## [2][[Survey] Influence of technology trends and hypes on software development and hiring practices (~5 mins)](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/glw8so/survey_influence_of_technology_trends_and_hypes/)

Hi /r/javascript!

We are 3 researchers from the [Institute of Software Technology](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/se) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and currently conduct a  survey  to analyze the influence of technology trends and hypes on  software  development practices and the hiring process. Our target group  are  software and IT professionals both in technical as well as in  hiring roles. We think a lot of you will have an opinion on this topic, having undoubtedly tried to make sense of the JS framework jungle out there. The survey should not take more than 5 minutes.

Your participation would be a great help! Feel free to distribute to your colleagues as well.

[https://www03.surveygrid.com/public/online/index?AZ4A%2F11111](https://www03.surveygrid.com/public/online/index?AZ4A%2F11111)

If you have any questions, we'll also happily answer them here.

Thank you and stay healthy!
