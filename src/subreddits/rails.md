Peter talked so fast. I can't keep up, let alone digest the ideas presented.

Does anyone have the slides and notes to [https://push.cx/2015/railsconf](https://push.cx/2015/railsconf) that they can share?

Thanks.

Tools and services that help to automatize development flow. Easy to install with increasing team effectiveness.

This is a general programming question and may not be specific to Rails. However, it's an issue I've run into building an app with a Rails backend.

Say I make an app and store user information in the Rails server-- such as a login and pw-- and push it all to github... if somebody clones that repo, runs it and tries to login with a login/pw that I saved will they be able to do it?

[The same thing that happened to this guy is happening to me](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52200128/rails-dynamic-add-nested-form-error-not-show-in-parameters), in my case I have two inputs `&lt;%= number_field_tag 'conciliacion_diferencias[]', nil, class: 'form-control', placeholder: 'ID de la venta' %&gt;` and I added a third one with Javascript, but only the first two are being sent to the controller...

This is the HTML I see when I use inspect in the parent `div` of the 3 inputs... I don't see any difference...

```
&lt;div id="difs-inputs" class="col-sm-6"&gt;
&lt;input type="number" name="conciliacion_diferencias[]" id="conciliacion_diferencias_" class="form-control" placeholder="ID de la venta"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type="number" name="conciliacion_diferencias[]" id="conciliacion_diferencias_" class="form-control" placeholder="ID de la venta"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input id="conciliacion_diferencias_" type="number" name="conciliacion_diferencias[]" placeholder="ID de la venta" class="form-control"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

I added the third input with the following JS function... 

```
                function addFields() {
                    var dif_container = document.getElementById("difs-inputs");
                    var tx_container = document.getElementById("txs-inputs");

                    var dif_br = document.createElement("br");
                    var tx_br = document.createElement("br");

                        var dif_input = document.createElement("input");
                        dif_input.id = "conciliacion_diferencias_";
                        dif_input.type = "number";

                        dif_input.name = "conciliacion_diferencias[]";
                        dif_input.placeholder = "ID de la venta"
                        dif_input.className = "form-control"
                        dif_container.appendChild(dif_br);
                        dif_container.appendChild(dif_input);
                }
```

But when I put "1", "2" and "3" in each one of the 3 inputs (if it helps you to understand, [I made a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/D28KDZO.jpg)) and submit I only see the first two values/parameters sent, in other words I see this in the params...

```
... "conciliacion_diferencias"=&gt;["1", "2"], ...
```

I don't get what's happening... Why are the dynamically created inputs not shown/sent in the parameters...

Want to a project where I build a website like thumbtack. If anyone doesnâ€™t know what thumbtack is its basically a website that matches customers with local professionals for a wide range of services that someone may need; an example could be locksmith. How hard would it be to create something like this ? Also how would I go about getting the information from all local businesses near someoneâ€™s location for their particular task ? Would I use an api and then store that Information in a database ? If so what api could I use ? Any advise for this project would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time and help  !

The business that Iâ€™m designing for has a lot of stubborn, crotchety customers, and in this new infrastructure, Iâ€™m trying to save the employees as much time as possible by empowering customers (who donâ€™t know how to search their email, or google a tracking number, or make it two clicks past a login page).

Whatâ€™s the best way for including params in a link that then update the value of an input?

I feel like I could just sit down and build a param trigger to render JS and put logic in a js.erb file, but something in my gut is saying that tailoring to unique params situations is usually a job for a pack full of jquery

I'd like to make the. id of each user created match the user\_id in my invoices table. They are associated by the same customer\_name, which the :customer\_name is in both tables. Currently, when I create and invoice, user\_id: nil. I'm not sure if I have to make an action in my controller, write an association in my routes, or define a method in my invoice model. Any help or things I can try is greatly appreciated.
