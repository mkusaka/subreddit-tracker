Sometimes I was considering the way to passed data to the previous fragment simplest? Didn't using EventBus, RxBus, or interface callback.  This is my article wrote about the simplest way to passed data to the previous fragment:

I'm looking into buying the newly released Huawei Nova 6. I just have a few concerns that I'd like to know the answers to.

&amp;#x200B;

1: Will the Chinese version pass Safetynet if the trade war stops?

2: If the phone will never pass Safetynet, what apps will I be unable to use?

3: Is there a way to make the phone think it passes Safetynet? I'm not sure what Magisk or rooting is, but I think it has something to do with it.

4: If there's a global release of the phone, will the global version pass Safetynet?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone else has any additional comments to make regarding new Huawei devices, I'd love to hear them. I'm not concerned as far as regular Google Play services go, I'm sure I will be able to get that installed. It's just stuff like Google Pay, banking apps etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

Google is asking about their clever changes to Storage:

- [Google survey about Scoped Storage for Android 11](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9HOzzyeCIEw0ij3?Source=scoped-storage)

If you feel your time will be wasted replying to them, you can just copy and paste as you please from the list in the second section below.

&amp;nbsp;


**Preamble**

Android is such a dominant mobile ecosystem, with such strategic value to it, that it needs to be run as an independent body, that is responsive to user and developer needs.

As it is, Android is hostage to the whims of an ad/search company, that doesn't still care about audio (low latency for music performance - as iOS quite easily does).  While Google polices the Google services assets, it has cared little for standardizing audio by the manufacturers (no standard setting exists for audio source where mobmno/stereo audio will work across devices).

As long as Google the ad/search behemoth runs this thing, things won't change - they just-don't-care.

If Android was an independent mobile ecosystem (not obliged to Google the ad/search behemoth), then Android would have made internet arun-time permission as well - if they cared about user security, as they claim.  Internet would not be left open as an **implicitly granted permission by all apps!** - Google has Bern intent on shutting down everthing else - call recording, SMS backup, location, all because it cannot bring itself to plug the foundational leak that internet brings to a system.

Google does not care about standard programming practices - they seek to break the ones that are strategically a threat, breaking their compact with developers - biggest one: that old apps will continue to run on new Android versions (much ballyhooed by Google in it's docs for years - no more).

The disruption of storage APIs has a long history with Google - cheap ext SD cards were a well discussed threat to cloud storage growth (which hindered Google's ability to grow cloud usage) - enter disruption of ext SD card access which went from seamless to non existent with KitKat - all for no great advantage to the ecosystem.  Ostensible reason was to reduce "clutter" on ext SD card - **no one believed that at the time**.  Devs complained,  no one listened, and users found out a year later as faut accompli.

All the alternate APIs introduced only serve to provide deniability for Google - "we provided an alternative" - an alternative but not an improvement - SAF was not a solution (not a complete API).

Meanwhile internal storage was increasing on phones - what was not seamlessly accessible on ext SD card thanks to KitKat, now became viable with plenty of internal storage - 128GB internal storage became common.

Now Google went after internal storage - constraining the APIs for internal storage access, while providing "alternatives" which broke seamless access and never quite made up in features - a way to fragment and break seamless availability of that feature, while providing deniability. 

We pointed out a year or two ago how constraining APIs will not provide security as the recommended way ie SAF is logically equivalent to the same thing (users routinely provide top level access).. Yet lots of pro-Google folks argued this SAF was so much better.

Now with Android 10 and 11 we find Google has "discovered" that flaw in SAF - their solution: SAF is no longer usable by just anyone.  Now you will require Permissions Declaration Form to use it (horrors of Call/SMS fiasco come to mind - just replace Call/SMS handler with file manager).

They provide some half baked MediaStore stuff as alternative, which fails basic file operation capabilities.

Right now the same people who argued for SAF are arguing in favor of abandoning POSIX open standards for File access - with praises for how streaming services are the thing.  That could only come from the minds of **people brainwashed into wanting to engineer local file access to be on par with cloud storage**.  Somewhere there is a compulsion to make cloud storage "as easy" as local storage - how to do that? - **make local storage as brain dead as cloud storage**, AND converge local storage APIs to the cloud APIs.

Google has a habit of making security the justification for these changes (since no one questions "security").  When we demonstrated SAF was AS insecure as anything else, they didn't believe that, but are taking that tack a few YEARS later.

So you tell me, **are these the behaviors of a company which thinks before it makes new APIs** - could it be that incompetent?  Or did it know exactly what it was doing - disrupting storage APIs?    Is really the whole exercise one of stonewalling - **building up brick walls to impede or curtail local storage until it is AS kludgy to work with as cloud storage?**

If Android was an ecosystem devoted to users and developers, Google would be taking pains to **make things easy for storage, and not steadily harder every year.**

&amp;nbsp;


**Here are the things we want**

- **File** access has to stay in both Java and NDK (C code)
 
- standard POSIX file access cannot be killed at Google's whim, just to **engineer parity with screwy cloud storage paradigms** (kill standard storage to make cloud storage look good)

- **Android management has to behave responsibly as custodians of the dominant phone ecosystem**.  Don't mess it up.  Unfortunately this cannot happen as long as Android is **handmaiden to the interests of an ad/search company which want to reverse history and regain control over cloud storage** revenues - just like Apple did.  Except Android grew BECAUSE it was seen by Android fans as having open storage model NOT beholden to cloud lockdown, like iOS.  Google is hoping it can renege on that without bring notice - censoring posts about Storage on r/android is not going to achieve this goal.  Google is remiss in not warning users about the **reduction in features in Androud 10 and 11 regarding storage**.

- there is no excuse for killing high performance file io and file/folder creation (MediaStore and even SAF are notoriously bad performing)

- do not kill high performance **random file access** - we need random file access in our apps - you are killing our apps' ability to perform as before.  We should not be forced to work for free to cover the gaps you are creating at your whim - just so users don't feel the impact of your actions.  **Devs are not your slaves to be covering glaring omissions you are deliberately creating** in the foundations of Android, just to fit some strategic cloud storage goal.

- do not kill fast **renaming of files**.  We use this for our file operations.  Having to copy a "streaming-conformant" file to another file before we can do file operations are unacceptable.. Our files are not on the cloud.  **Do not dumb down local storage just to make cloud storage look on-par** - that is just deceitful and malicious.

- do not restrict our abilities to **organize files into folders**.  We were doing so before, and we want to continue that in the future.  Providing flat file areas using MediaStore is not a replacement. 

- do not restrict **fopen() in C code in native NDK**.  You are violating POSIX file support if you do so.  As long as the Java side of code has gotten the appropriate permissions from the user, that file path should be workable from C code.  We don't need Google to neuter standard file behavior for our C code and libraries.

- do not curtail our ability to show file structure for our files to the user.  We allow a file manager like interface to our users.  Do not force us to rewrite or throw away capabilities we have provided for years.  Do not force us to prove we are a file manager app (via a new Permissions Declaration Form) just to show our files which are stored in a persistent place on internal storage.  We do not have time to change all our file manager code - and that too for free.  What is the appeal of these changes for devs?

- if you were **remiss to hook users to cloud storage in your infancy** (when you were touting the openness of Android and ridiculing the closed storage on iOS), **do not do it after-the-fact** as you are trying to do it now.  Android is a dominant mobile ecosystem now, and of strategic value to the world.  You cannot **unilaterally sneak in such breakages into this ecosystem**.  The only way you have successfully done this before is by hiding the changes that are upcoming, and then having users find out a year later as a fait accompli.  However these storage changes are so big they have **potential to break or disrupt Android**.

- do not act like all these file changes are "minor", or edge cases, or "only a small number of apps will be affected".  **You are breaking POSIX file support, no two ways about it**.  No amount of YouTuber praise for Android 10 and 11 will cover for this.


**Feel free to copy paste any of the above in your reply to Google survey**.
