Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Hi there, I have an android game with 100k downloads but only  13 people play my game daily. How do you retain more people?

I want to spoof my phone's sensor data. However while doing that I want to learn how it actually works instead of just writing some code which spoof's the data. When I google, I only get stuff related to getting sensor data from SensorManager (and 2 posts from 8 years ago which idk if they are relevant anymore). Any helpful information is welcome. Thanks in advanced :)
## [9][Where is the R.java file in AS 4.0.1 when you create a blank activity?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i98pry/where_is_the_rjava_file_in_as_401_when_you_create/)

Where is the R.java file located in the project structure? If R.jar and R.txt has replaced it how do you modify R.id by hand in the file?

I created a blank activity project and can't find it. Shouldn't R.java be included in the built project. I was able to run the blank activity just fine but can't find the R.java file.

Hi. I´m currently trying to set up universal linking to only work with some paths. Works very well for iOS since I can just write "NOT /something" but I havent found a way to do so on Android. Does anyone know? These are the paths I´ve written for iOS. How would I write this in Android?  
“NOT /tag/\*",

“NOT /\*.se\*",

“NOT /\*.fi\*",

“/\*/\*”

Where \* is anything but I think it´s the same in android right?
