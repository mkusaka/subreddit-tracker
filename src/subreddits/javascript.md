Recently created my own eslint config and stumbled across [https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn) which has a few reasonable rules in there that have the potential to massively contribute to code quality, e.g. prefer-array-find, prefer-modern-dom-apis.

I was also unaware of [https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library) as well as the included eslint-plugin-jest which... should definitely have your attention attention if you use testing-library and/or jest.

[https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) also has import/order which may alphabetically group your imports, improving readability.

Anything else I've been missing out on?
