Hi everyone, I'm searching a GUI editor for complex javascript objects.
I tried dat.GUI but it's not working well with arrays and optional (undefined) properties.
Anyone can suggest me an alternative or at least knows a package like this?
I'm starting to create one on my own but it's a lot of work and I have other priorities.
If you want to see what I need to edit checkout this: https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles/wiki/tsParticles-Options
