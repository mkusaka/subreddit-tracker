**TLDR**

I'm making an multiStep form for my project that is inspired from [Brad Traversy's Tutorial of making Multi-Step form in React](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_step_form). So as per the basic structure of this form

&amp;#x200B;

[structure of multi step form](https://reddit.com/link/ghlaym/video/6lh6fui784y41/player)

I made a main Parent component called `Multistep` as below

    import React, { Component } from 'react'
    import StepOne from './StepOne'
    export class Multiform extends Component {
        state={
            step:1,
            input:'',
            select:''
        }
         // Proceed to next step
      nextStep = () =&gt; {
        const { step } = this.state;
        this.setState({
          step: step + 1
        });
      };
    
      // Go back to prev step
      prevStep = () =&gt; {
        const { step } = this.state;
        this.setState({
          step: step - 1
        });
      };
    
      // Handle fields change
      handleChange = input =&gt; e =&gt; {
        this.setState({ [input]: e.target.value });
      };
        render() {
            const { step } = this.state;
            const {  input, countryFlag, select } = this.state;
            const values = { input, countryFlag, select };
            switch(step){
              case 1:
                return(
                  &lt;StepOne
                  nextStep={this.nextStep}
                  handleChange={this.handleChange}
                  values={values}
                    /&gt;
                )
        }
    }
    
    export default Multiform

and a child component `StepOne` as below

    import React, { Component } from 'react'
        export class StepOne extends Component {
            continue = (e) =&gt; {
                e.preventDefault();
                this.props.nextStep();
            };
    
            back = (e) =&gt; {
                e.preventDefault();
                this.props.prevStep();
            };
            state = {
                countryFlag: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeRahulAhire/country-calling-code-html/master/phone_icon.png',
            };
            render() {
                const selectCountryChange = () =&gt; {
                    const img = document.querySelector('#img');
                    const select = document.querySelector('#country');
                    img.src = `https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/h80/${select.selectedOptions[0].dataset.countrycode.toLowerCase()}.webp`;
    
                    this.setState({
                        countryFlag: `https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/h80/${select.selectedOptions[0].dataset.countrycode.toLowerCase()}.webp`
                    });
                };
                const { values, handleChange, } = this.props;
                return (
                    &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={this.back} className="col-form-prev"&gt;
                    &lt;input
                        type="email"
                        placeholder="your-email@example.com"
                        onChange={handleChange('input')}
                        defaultValue={values.input}
                    /&gt;
                    &lt;div class="image" onChange={selectCountryChange}&gt;  
                        &lt;img src={this.state.countryFlag} id="img"/&gt;  
                     &lt;/div&gt;
                     &lt;select id="country" onChange={handleChange('select')} defaultValue={values.select}&gt;  
                        &lt;option data-countryCode="IN" value="91"&gt;India&lt;/option&gt;  
                        &lt;option data-countryCode="US" value="1"&gt;US&lt;/option&gt;  
                        &lt;option data-countryCode="GB" value="44"&gt;UK&lt;/option&gt;  
                     &lt;/select&gt;  
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                )
            }
        }
    
        export default StepOne

according to that tutorial, everything for text input field the state management was working absolutely fine. Even when i tried to go next step and come back, the data was still accessible and persisted in that `&lt;input/&gt;` and `&lt;select/&gt;` field.

I also tried to store the image source in Multiform state but with an another `onChange` handler but i wasnt able to figure out exactly how to do that.

The `img.src` is manipulated by the `selectCountryChange` in `stepOne` as below

    state = {
            countryFlag: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeRahulAhire/country-calling-code-html/master/phone_icon.png',
        };
    
    const selectCountryChange = () =&gt; {
                const img = document.querySelector('#img');
                const select = document.querySelector('#country');
                img.src = `https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/h80/${select.selectedOptions[0].dataset.countrycode.toLowerCase()}.webp`;
    
                this.setState({
                    countryFlag: `https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/h80/${select.selectedOptions[0].dataset.countrycode.toLowerCase()}.webp`
                })
    
    &lt;div class="image" onChange={selectCountryChange}&gt;  
                    &lt;img src={this.state.countryFlag} id="img"/&gt;
    
                 &lt;/div&gt;

Can anyone please guide me on how to add the img.src to the state of Multiform and make it persistent even when i go back and forth of the form just the `&lt;input/&gt;` and `&lt;select/&gt;`.

Hi,

I've read the doc about React.Suspense, it seems great, but how can I use it while performing an api call, with axios for example?

To be more specific, why this code doesn't work? 

    export default Foo(){
    const [state, setState] = useState()
    
    useEffect(()=&gt; {
        axios.get("url")
        .then(res=&gt; setState(res.data))
        .catch(_=&gt; setState(null)
    }, [])
    
    return (
        &lt;Suspense fallback="loading data"&gt;
           &lt;div&gt;hello {state.name}&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/Suspense&gt;
    )
    }

Thanks!

Hey, 

I've recently enrolled in Stephen Grinder's React-Redux course and I can say I'm quite pleased with it. After that I was hoping to get Node.js, Express and MongoDB course of his. I've also enrolled in it but seems like methods he uses in this one are deprecated and I'm not sure if I should continue getting the course. 

What do you think about this course? Should I complete it or just find a new one?

And which one I should be enrolling?

Here is the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/).
