We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I've been learning React whilst holed up for the quarantine and made the cellular automata browser toy I've always wanted but never had. It's my first React app, and second non-trivial javascript app. Built with Chakra UI, Redux, and HTML Canvas.

https://lifelike.psychedelicio.us/

You can change the rules and other settings while the app is running, draw on the grid, save the grid as an image or record it running as video, save the current state as a "bookmark" in localstorage, plus a range of other interesting features.

It is also mobile-friendly! Well, it's as friendly as I could make it, given the nature of the app.

It's taken me about around month to build as I worked through Stephen Grider's and Tyler McGinnis's React courses. 

A brief write-up is on github, as well as a guide to using the thing: https://github.com/psychedelicious/lifelike

I greatly appreciate any critical feedback on the design or code. I know I have huge room for improvement in both areas. Suggestions and feedback for the app itself are also appreciated, of course! 

Thank you for taking the time to use and/or review the app!

Hi there guys!  
First of all I'm relatively new to reactjs channel and reddit in general, so just wanted to say hello!

Recently I've had some time ("thanks" to coronavirus) to work on React/Redux project. Truth be told quite simple one - basic CRUD. Had some issues, learnt a lot. There's still quite a lot of things to add in a meantime.  


I would more than appreciate if you had a time to check and play with it.   
Any opinions and tips more than welcome!

Stay safe y'all!

Where is the best place to learn Reactjs for beginners?
YouTube videos are old and things have changed.  Some of the websites are all over the place.  So where is a good place to start and build some knowledge.

Thanks in advance for your input.
## [11][Best approach to increment number each X milliseconds [React Native]](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gc3cne/best_approach_to_increment_number_each_x/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gc3cne/best_approach_to_increment_number_each_x/
---
Good morning,

Im trying to create an incremental number ( 0% to 100%) that moves forward every X ms, but with the current approach I think its too heavy on performance,  it slows down my Android emulator too much.

I've tried with the classic setInterval inside useEffect, and now with some promises and custom awaits, but it is still making my android emulator lag.

Is there something that im missing, if it was React web i'll modify directly the dom instead of updating the state for each increment, but I can't do that with React Native (Or I don't know how).

Help will be much apreciated.
