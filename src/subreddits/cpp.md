**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft?

## [4][C++ London goes online](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ga8yhs/c_london_goes_online/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ga8yhs/c_london_goes_online/

Like many meet-ups, C++ London is responding to the lockdown and social distancing measures by moving online. In fact it's a little late to the party as, early on, I felt that an online meet-up would miss too much of what makes an in person meet-up so valuable. After all, you can watch many of the same talks on YouTube anyway.

In-person meet-ups are all about getting people together in one place, giving them something to talk about - then giving space for that to happen. It's also about interaction with speakers - whether in the talk itself, or afterwards.

I wanted to try and recapture as much of that as possible. It's never going to be the same, but I think we can still make it worthwhile.

So, for the [next C++ London (tonight - 19:00 BST)](https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/270022408/) we have three components:

1. A live YouTube stream of the presentations.
2. A [sli.do](https://sli.do) site for asking (and voting on) questions, as well as polls.
3. A set of video conferencing rooms (on [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/)) for the audience (and later the speaker(s)) to hang out, network, start discussions, etc. Drinks are optional.

The last part is the biggest part of the experiment. video conferenced social discussions don't tend to scale very well with large numbers of people (even in a business environment they need to be strictly hosted). Technologically, the free Jitsi instance doesn't cope well with lots of people in a room either. I've found that 8-10 is about the max. That's why I'm providing multiple parallel rooms. If one is too crowded, or you don't think the discussion of interesting, hop to another. Will that work? I don't know. Let's try it!

I've tried to make this all as easy as possible[. I've created a single page](https://live.cpplondon.org) that aggregates all these services together (just using iframes). So you go to one place and can follow the whole thing there. To jump between Jitsi rooms you just press a room number!

If you do want to follow one of the services on the first party site, I've made that easy too, with an "open externally" button on each section.

For best results put your browser full screen, then zoom out (or in) until you get the bottom two frames side-by-side (or, if you have multiple monitors, use the external sites feature for a more custom arrangement).

As I say, this is a big experiment, so I'm keen to hear what you think. [Do join us if you can](https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/270022408/). I'm happy to share any of what I'm doing behind the scenes with any other group organisers who want to try something similar.

Is there any way to visualize a c++ project as call graph and class graph ?! 

That helps to undertand what is going on.
## [9][I re-implemented the paper "Sorting nine inputs requires twenty-five comparisons" in c++, what do you guys think?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/g9630p/i_reimplemented_the_paper_sorting_nine_inputs/)

https://github.com/andersfylling/sorting-nine-inputs-requires-twenty-five-comparisons

For my master thesis, I'm working on the problem of finding a sorting network of the smallest size that can sort a sequence of N elements. One of the tasks were to re-implement the original code in c++, to make it a more viable reference point for my upcoming findings/improvements.

Since I only did a tiny amount of poor c++ a few years ago, I kinda started out as a beginner. There are some obvious improvements to be made like the loops, pre-conditions for subsumption, IO dead time, clustering, etc. Which I have implemented in my main project I'll be release in a month or so along with my paper - this is just a baseline reference.

Edit: note that this isn't another sorting algorithm. The paper regards proving the minimum size of a sorting networks for sequences of N elements. So essentially you can state you want to find the answer for a sequence of 9 elements and will output the answer =)

Hey, I have been learning C++ for a few months now and I am comfortable with the language, although I have lots more to learn. Is it unrealistic to aim to become a C++ dev by the end of the year?

When building a path with `std::filesystem` I was wondering what is considered good practice in the community. Let's say I have an absolute path `root` and I want to use it to access a file in a subfolder.

 `using fs = std::filesystem;`

`const auto root = fs::path{"/root/user"};`

`const auto path1 = root / "folder0/folder1/file.ext";`

`const auto path2 = root / "folder0" / "folder1" / "file.ext";`
