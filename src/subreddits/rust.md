Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hurj77/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hello everyone,
I am completely new to this sub and I recently got interested in Rust. I am curious if there are resources for web scraping with Rust . I write in python with bs4, requests and selenium . Is it viable to transition to Rust ? Do you have any recommendation I can check out ?

Are there any languages/projects out there which compile a language to Rust? I as thinking of experimenting with writing a compiled programming language,  and want  to output Rust code. My very rough idea is to create a Rust like language, and produce code which has Gc proc maco attributes on all structs which contain references.

Hello rustaceans!  
I'm in charge of organise the **2020 RustLab**  edition and I know how much important is the community contribution for  events (i've been into the python community since 2012 orgasining the  PyConIT event), that's why I am posting here. RustLab is a young Rust event at its second year (last  year we gathered \~170 people from all the world) that will take place  between **october 12th and 18th**. This year, due to ovbious safety issues, we chose to run a **full remote online event**.

 [https://www.rustlab.it/](https://www.rustlab.it/)  


Our **CFP is open** and we are always looking for talented speakers to build our quality schedule: [https://www.rustlab.it/page/1495142/call-for-proposal](https://www.rustlab.it/page/1495142/call-for-proposal)  


We are open to partnership proposals and to give space to **openprojects** with sessions and workshops. Obviously we follow the Rust Code of Conduct and strongly believe in **inclusion** and in the richness of **diversity**  (e.g.: this year we are trying to give a better web accessibility for  disabled people). If you want to contact us please feel free to write at   info@rustlab.it

I really hope that this could be of interest for the Rust community :)

bye!
