Hello all!

I have spent some time tutoring people recently, and it got me thinking about setting up a guided project program. My current thought is to create a project outline for students follow; a task list in a sense. Each week, students will have a list of tasks to attempt to get through (if they can't that's fine, I know life happens) and at the end of the week I would review their code and provide feedback to help them improve. I'd also be available to answer questions on slack throughout the week. The goal is to have the students do all of the actual programming, so the end result is something that they created entirely, I would only be acting as a guide. I'd hope for the project to last about 8-10 weeks.

I know how challenging it can be to find programming help, especially for those who are learning on their own. If this sounds interesting to you, or if you have any recommendations / concerns please let me know! I'm hoping to be able to give back to the community where possible :)

SimpleTable works with local or remote data (with automated pagination) and have two built-in themes: material and flat.

The library try to be simple enough to be used in cases where does not needed more complex features and the productivity is necessary. Simple CRUD's or website details list is common examples.

**Rockpack** is a simple solution for creating React Application with Server Side Rendering, bundling, linting, testing, logging, localizing.

[https://github.com/AlexSergey/rockpack](https://github.com/AlexSergey/rockpack)

There are several cases where **Rockpack** is useful:

**Beginners** \- With the help of Rockpack, any newbie to React [can deploy a project of any complexity in a few minutes](https://www.rockpack.io/fast-setup). Applications can be either regular single page or with a project structure, [server-side rendering](https://www.rockpack.io/ssr-1-creating-simple-ssr-application/), etc.

**Large projects from scratch** \- Rockpack supports most of the webpack best practices and scales to big projects.

**Startup** \- If you need to quickly check an idea without wasting time on unfolding and setting up the project.

**Library or React component** \- If you want to write a UMD library or React component, there's support for the ESM/CommonJS builds as well as the minifying.

**Legacy projects or modular use**. - You can for example [migrate a legacy application to SSR using Rockpack](https://www.rockpack.io/ssr-2-migration-legacy-app-to-ssr/).

I have made a course about creating state machines with XState and using it inside React apps.  
State machines with XState is a fresh topic for Frontend development, which allows us to better manage applications state.

Check it out: [https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-state-machines-with-xstate-and-react](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-state-machines-with-xstate-and-react/?referralCode=145403C5EBEB0D9633EC&amp;fbclid=IwAR1HTYFvf8KBw03FyomPmqAMTbuQ8r_XgjhrdFVhMYfoWfLwemrh3_jFnBE)
