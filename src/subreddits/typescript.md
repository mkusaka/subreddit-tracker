So I come from the Java world and I'm having some difficulty with Typescript's `infer` keyword. I'm playing around trying to infer the generic types of a nested data structure, but I can't seem to make the types line up, and I was hoping someone could show me the error of my ways. 

     type Tuple&lt;T&gt; = [Foo&lt;T&gt;, Bar&lt;T&gt;]
     type Tuples&lt;...&gt; = ReadonlyArray&lt;Tuple&lt;?&gt;&gt;

     const tuples = [ // inferred as Tuples&lt;string | number&gt; 
       ['one', 'two'], // inferred Tuple&lt;string&gt;
       [3, 4] // inferred Tuple&lt;number&gt;
     ]

This works fine if i specify the types explicitly, but I'm sure there's got to be a way to infer them.

I've tried searching, and I find various generators and such that will generate Typescript files from C#, but is there anything that does it the other way around? I.e. something that can generate C# types from Typescript? ðŸ¤”

Hello Everyone,

I have created a small library that is designed to transform data using a deduction map, this map contains an array of deductions, each deduction will use one or more values from the source and apply a list of transforms before storing it in the output at the given path.

&amp;#x200B;

Really interested in feedback and suggestions on how to improve the idea.

Thanks

Hi, everyone I'm somewhat kinda new to typescript but not oblivious to JavaScript, What I'm wanting to do (if possible) is wanting to combine my 3+ .ts files when it transpiles / compiles I would like for it to be in one .js file using the modular pattern.

similar to what sass kinda does with with multiply partials.

I saw a comment in the TSConfig file for "outfile" and I couldn't get it to work, I kept getting an error about lack of persmissions or something.
## [10][Is is possible to combine multiple NestJS Swagger decorators?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/f03w6o/is_is_possible_to_combine_multiple_nestjs_swagger/)

Hi. I'm using NestJS and Swagger. Before each GET router which returns result as a list, i add these decorators:

    @Get()
    @ApiQuery({ name: "page", required: false })
    @ApiQuery({ name: "limit", required: false })
    @ApiQuery({ name: "sort", required: false })
    @ApiQuery({ name: "order", required: false })

Is there any chance that i could combine those into one custom decorator, such as `@GetListOptions()`?

Hi there, i'd really like to use the cool new features like optional chaining..

I followed the npm i instructions from the blog

 [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/) 

however after it downloaded, tsc -- version still says i'm on Version 3.6.4

And the compiler still complains about optional chaining... do you know how to fix this?

Thanks much!
