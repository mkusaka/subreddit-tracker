When would I want to use local storage over IndexedDB?

There's the `localforage` package that gives me access to IndedexDB with a simpler API, so I no longer see the point in using local storage at all.

Am I missing something?
## [11][[AskJS] AI !== Algorithms ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/ivy3sa/askjs_ai_algorithms/)

At the risk of sounding dead basic. Is their a difference between ai and algorithms? For my course I've been given a remit of building something that utilises ai, of course I can go back to my tutor but It's the weekend and if I can get an alternate consensus in the mean time...

So, if for example I built a game of checkers and created an algorithm that picks a move for the computer. Is that ai? If it's not, then isn't it going down the path of machine learning?
