If you are a vim user and use the plugin coc.nvim (which is an autocompleter and much more for vim, here is the repo [https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim))  I want to create an extension for Kotlin. Unfortunately I am not very skilled in TypeScript (but I will use my energy in learning and finishing this) so if anyone is interested in helping me and contributing to the extension you are very much welcome. Here is the repo: [https://github.com/isaac025/coc-kotlin](https://github.com/isaac025/coc-kotlin) feel free for any suggestions. I am planning on using/forking VScode's Kotlin completer: [https://github.com/fwcd/vscode-kotlin](https://github.com/fwcd/vscode-kotlin)

So this Kotlin IR feature came up a lot lately and I was wondering whether or not I can use this feature to make custom transpiler from Kotlin to another programming language, but all I could find for now was just information on how to turn it on for existing front-ends (Native, JS). Can we extend it somehow?

Hi, 

I am very new to this and I don't know-how to important a function in android studio. Could someone please show me an example or reference I can't find anything on youtube.

So I am in my 4th Year at University, and I just got introduced to Kotlin in my Android Development class last quarter and I got to say, despite my reluctance(my first language ever was Java), I have become a fan.

Now I am really excited about Kotlin MultiPlatform, but it hasn't exactly caught some steam yet. Thus I was wondering if there was any way that I could contribute to the community by helping with some small issues initially. To that effect, I was also wondering if I could help with something more complicated later, for my Senior Project(maybe helping with the compiler/library).

I'm trying to use a class reflector to iterate over the properties of a class. But I don't really understand `KProperty.get()` and the whole reflector thing. There isn't much documentation on kotlinlang.org, although I did find a [question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45875491/what-is-a-receiver-in-kotlin) on the subject. The answer is very well written and based on it I have come up with this: 
```kotlin
for (trait: ItemTrait in traits) {
  val traitObject = JSONObject()   
trait::class.declaredMemberProperties.toList().stream().filter{it.hasAnnotation&lt;TraitData&gt;()}.forEach{property -&gt;
    traitObject.put(property.name, property.get(ItemTrait.()))```

But the compiler still wants an expression in the brackets next to ItemTrait. What on earth does it mean? Possibly relevant sidenote, in the docs for KProperty1 it states that the reciever passed into `get()` needs to be a class instance but I don't really know what that means
