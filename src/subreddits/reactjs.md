Hello all, 

I wanted to learn more about socketio and some real-time data stuff so I built a chat app.

[https://joinsynapse.com/](https://joinsynapse.com/)

I didn't want to deal with authentication and all that jazz (since I deal with it every day at work) so I thought an anonymous chat app would be really neat. I've added image upload and unread message tracking, as well as some functions to regenerate your current identity. I posted this in [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/) over the weekend and got some good feedback. I think it's in a decent spot now.

Simple yet interactive task board for your mobile browser. Written in **React** using **create-react-app**. [https://github.com/moubi/flow-task#readme](https://github.com/moubi/flow-task#readme)

This is my third app to implemented [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) in and it didn't go without difficulties. The main constraints came from inline edit elements and swiping gestures.

I am looking for help to further develop the project.

If you are interested in working with React or would like to use the app, ping me

Hi people

I have been studying React for a while now and considering my level I feel quite confident. I have also been hunting for a job, and I found one that will use Svelte instead of React. Simple question - do you guys recommend that I take this role? Or keep looking until I find a React role?

Svelte is quite popular and it is growing but using React feels safe seeing as it is backed by a huge company, just like Angular as well.

So **TL:DR**, looking for a junior react role, but there is a possible svelte role instead, should I take this?

I am looking for a graphical form designer, which would support drag n drop of form elements (buttons, label entry areas etc) onto a form. 

[example](https://blog.4d.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FormEditor-e1512993913941.png)

When done an export to javascript or React jsx.

Does such a thing exist?

if so, any recommendations?

Thanks in advance!

newS :) sorry for typo

Hi all,I have a large project that would really benefit from concurrent but since it's not stable release I can't include it yet.Is there any news recently about getting concurrent mode out in a stable release.Looks like Facebook is slowly rolling out new Facebook design which leads me to think it will be sooner then later.
