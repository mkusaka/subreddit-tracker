I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.

Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.\n\nFor what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.\n\n*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.

At work we have an internally developed distributed task runner system (Java) with a single main/delegator server and multiple task runner servers.\n\nJobs are a hierarchical tree of tasks that each have their own parameters and dependencies, parameters can be passed down into sub-tasks, tasks can spawn more sub-tasks that the main server redistributes to executors. Executors report status and logs back to the main server for quick examination of how a process ran.\n\nIt works really well but is showing its age a little. It was developed before Hadoop was a thing, before containers were mainstream and definitely before the AWS revolution. The problem is it assumes on-prem zero cost servers, so a dozen executor machines sit there idle until the one time a week/month they have to run their tasks. Worse there are multiple clusters and one cluster of five EC2 instances maxes out while several other ten-instance clusters sit idle. It's a crushing waste of resources.\n\nMy question is- is there an on-prem solution (or cloud solution I guess) for this situation where multiple clusters can join in on a process or a single larger cluster can be configured to work on whatever is needed if idle but snap to a certain task if it starts? Or alternatively an AWS or cloud solution where only processing time is charged?\n\nI have looked into various task runner applications.\n\nApache Airflow (from AirBnB) is nice but needs serious bolted-on Celery job queue configuration to handle multiple executor servers.\n\nLuigi (from Spotify) has a task dependency concept but I don't think it can farm out tasks to multiple servers. Also jobs are in Python which isn't a dealbreaker but would prefer declarative JSON, YAML, XML, even INI.\n\nNomad (from Hashicorp- vagrant, packer, etc.) is a really nice cluster manager, very professional UI and documentation but unfortunately doesn't support DAGs or a tree of tasks to perform with dependencies.\n\nI looked in to a few more but it became clear that there wasn't a single offering that supported multiple task runner servers, tree-shaped (DAG) jobs\n\nAm I missing something here?

At work we have an internally developed distributed task runner system (Java) with a single main/delegator server and multiple task runner servers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jobs are a hierarchical tree of tasks that each have their own parameters and dependencies, parameters can be passed down into sub-tasks, tasks can spawn more sub-tasks that the main server redistributes to executors. Executors report status and logs back to the main server for quick examination of how a process ran.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works really well but is showing its age a little. It was developed before Hadoop was a thing, before containers were mainstream and definitely before the AWS revolution. The problem is it assumes on-prem zero cost servers, so a dozen executor machines sit there idle until the one time a week/month they have to run their tasks. Worse there are multiple clusters and one cluster of five EC2 instances maxes out while several other ten-instance clusters sit idle. It&amp;#39;s a crushing waste of resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is- is there an on-prem solution (or cloud solution I guess) for this situation where multiple clusters can join in on a process or a single larger cluster can be configured to work on whatever is needed if idle but snap to a certain task if it starts? Or alternatively an AWS or cloud solution where only processing time is charged?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have looked into various task runner applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apache Airflow (from AirBnB) is nice but needs serious bolted-on Celery job queue configuration to handle multiple executor servers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luigi (from Spotify) has a task dependency concept but I don&amp;#39;t think it can farm out tasks to multiple servers.
