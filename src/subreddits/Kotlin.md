Hey guys I just wanna tell you to be careful when upgrading to 1.4. I have a really small project (about 800 loc) and it worked perfectly fine with 1.3.72 but when I compile it using 1.4.0 then it failes because of a Java out of memory Exception. But it also tells me in which file the problem is. This file is only 30 lines long, but it does use a lot of type interference. When I open this file in intellij while the project is configured to 1.4 intellij starts loading the highlighting and then it just crashes. I tried it with 1.3.72 and activated the experimental type interference algorithm which is now enabled in 1.4 but I'm not really sure if I activated the experimental features correctly because that worked. Did anyone of you run into similar problems with the new version?

Hi Reddit, I'm software developer for a long time now but I never touch the frontend to this day - I want to change this using KotlinJS, if u guys have a moment to answer a few of my questions and give me some tips on start that would be great ;)

As a context - I want to do a real production app using it - not just a demo. Backend is just spring rest with sso oauth2.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

1. Is KotlinJS production ready? When I started with kotlin+spring it had a lot of stability issues 2 years ago but it was fixed over time - I don't want to start it when its not ready.
2. What libraries is good to add (and use) on the start of the project?
3. Is there some good example apps and material to learn?
4. Is anyone of u using this and recommend?
5. Maybe some general tips? :)
