Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I just ran my unit tests through the terminal, it took 6 mins. (\~30 smaller modules so guess I'll have to live with that)

Before that I was typing in Android Studio and the autocomplete was struggling to come up with something within 3 seconds. The Android Studio task is taking around 200% of my CPU when I start typing, according to activity monitor. It lies steadily at 4GB of ram + some java processes together taking another 5GB. I'm currently at 14,3 out of 16 GB of ram, with 2GB in the swap, no emulator only 5 chrome tabs, slack, and spotify open.

I've got a Macbook Pro 2018, pretty maxed out with 2,7 GHz quad-core i7, 16GB ram. Do I have to throw this out and get the 16 inch, i9 &amp; 64GB? I don't even want a bigger computer.

Anyways, I had to write down my frustration. Is someone else experiencing this or am I going mad?

Is this a new requirement? I'm trying to publish a game designed for mobile phones, but they're forcing me to include screenshots for a "7-inch tablet"..

I am Using Android architecture patterns with : Navigation Graph, NavHost in a very basic / standard way

Currently I have one activity, with inside its layout :

\- Material AppBarLayout + Toolbar

\- NavHostFragment

Then obviously, I have a few different fragment that I navigateTo and their content gets replaced under my toolbar. 

All standard for now, but now how can I navigate to a fragment like it is done in Reddit App when :

\- clicking on the Search icon

\- clicking on any post to see it 

? It seems like a popup/modal that take all screen space and having its own back button.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried BottomSheemDialogFragment without success.  
Is it a new activity with another dedicated NavHostFragment ? :'(

Hi, i wish to add an actively updated piece of system information to my status bar, but i can't figure out where the functionality for this is. What i want to add is along the lines of the battery percentage, but all i can find is how to change colors and dimming. Any idea on how to add custom system information to the status bar?

Tried uploading a new APK to production but can’t upload on the new Play Console. But I switched to classic Google Play Console and was successfully able to upload. 

Anybody experienced the same issue? And how do I resolve it in the future? I am using Safari by the way.
