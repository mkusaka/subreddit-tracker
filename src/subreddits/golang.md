I wanted to explain how to use Go interfaces to mock against concrete third party libraries to a coworker and ended up just making a very simple repository with the bare minimum.  I thought it might be useful to someone else out there:

Asynq is a simple Go library for queueing tasks and processing them in the background with workers.  
It is backed by Redis and it is designed to have a low barrier to entry. It should be integrated in your web stack easily.

Hi,  


For the last few weeks, I created a chatbot for my friend using Dialogflow for some easy premade QA with letting them easy interface to set questions and responses.  
To be honest it's pretty primitive...  
Anyone know on a good guide for golang for self-learning bot?  
All I found is python(if there is no choice I will go that way, the problem I prefer to go even if it's less efficient).
## [9][split code to packages more or less?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/eulm3x/split_code_to_packages_more_or_less/)

Hello,

when Im reading articles about go and packages, quite often there is mentioned it is not adviced to split code to packages much. I tried to find something more to know why, but I did not.

For example as I understand this [code](https://github.com/nanamen/go-onion-architecture-sample) shouldnt containe that much packages, probably just one due to its size.

Could you please give me some link or at least explain me here why it is not adviced?

Cheers
