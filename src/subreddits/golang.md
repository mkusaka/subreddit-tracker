Hi,

This might be one of the stranger posts, as many seem to wish to enter my field (DevOps). But truly, I enjoy development a lot more, specifically Go development. I don't feel the same level of excitement writing Jenkins pipelines, managing Kubernetes clusters or maintaining Terraform modules. Any time I get to develop a solution in Go/Python I feel genuine excitement. Sadly I can't opensource alot of my tooling either. It feels like I'm a glue, like the Star Wars midichlorians, but I wish to be the force user. 

Has anyone made this transition before? Any advice? Go roles are quite scarce around London as it is.

I was looking around for some Go GUI libraries and I came across Gio, an immediate mode GUI written in Go with great multi-platform support. I decided I was going to make a project with Gio, and as a result, I ended up making a fun gopher-inspired game where you play as a gopher navigating a garden. This is my first time using Gio and I am almost certain I did a lot of things in different ways from how they should be done with Gio, but at least I got the game running and I think it is pretty neat. I strongly recommend using Gio and for more information on it, visit [gioui.org](https://gioui.org/). Also, if you are interested in the project I made with Gio, the source code is viewable at [github.com/enzo-sa/gopher-garden](https://github.com/enzo-sa/gopher-garden). I'm not trying to push anything down anyone's throats, but I just had such a great experience with Gio and I think that it deserves more recognition.

Sorry if this question was already posted.

What are some of the plugins (like VSCode plugins) and other tools you're using to speed up and optimize your development workflow?

Mine so far are:

Main IDE: VSCode

Plugins: 
- [Docker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker)
- [Dotenv](https://github.com/mikestead/vscode-dotenv)
- [EditorConfig](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)
- [Go](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go) (doh!)
- [Pgsql](https://github.com/doublefint/vscode-pgsql)
- [Todo+](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-todo-plus)

CLI: iTerm2 with zsh + oh-my-zsh

Database Client: Navicat for PostgreSQL, but I'd like to switch this one out, too much trouble and bugs lately.

I keep all my Go projects in separate Docker containers, where I can control the package versions, etc.

I use Ansible to set up a new server and for deploying applications, if there's need to be some custom stuff set up on the server, otherwise I use Github Actions for deployment.
