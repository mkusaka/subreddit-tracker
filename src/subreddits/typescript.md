I'm having trouble understanding this odd behavior...

```
interface Foo {
    n? : number;
    s: string;
}

const foo = { n : 1 } as Foo;  // OK

```

If  `s` here isn't optional, then why does this work? Isn't this an error? Shouldn't we be assigning `s` to something?

I am taking about the errors which are provided when you tsc . Nut I want to get them without building .

I'm really stuck on this issue... 

If I have a react components library that I want to isolate I can't just setup a devDependency on @types/react because when I import it  I get a conflict saying that types were found in two locations.  

This is super silly because they're the same types and same version.

I *could* setup peerDependencies, I think, but then I can't have unit tests in the main code or use that as a module by itself.

It ends up causing a LOT of hassle and now I'm basically dead in the water until I completely refactor my  components/modules into separate npm projects.

Is there a workaround here?
## [6][Prevent tsc from renaming variables that are not exposed .](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h89fc9/prevent_tsc_from_renaming_variables_that_are_not/)

I have the following two functions : `getAllTextNodesDeep` , `recurseDomTreeNodes` , in my own personal browser-specific typescript library .

In my library there is an entry point file that exports both of them .

Each of the functions has its own file that default exports it .

The first function uses the second function.

When I `tsc` my library the compiler changes the internal variable names . So instead of `recurseDomTreeNodes` there is `recurseDomTreeNodes_1` all over the place inside the `getAllTextNodesDeep` function definition .

That cause no issues at all except in the following case :

I want to add some functions in the window object of the puppeteer `page` instance . When I do that , and then invoke `getAllTextNodesDeep` , the function looks for `recurseDomTreeNodes_1` and not `recurseDomTreeNodes` , which makes my function throw error.

Do you know if there is any way to make tsc not change internal names?

Or am I writing bad practice code and I should go for a dependency injection or something else ?

## [8][How do you manage complex state models? (NgRx etc)](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h7u1z0/how_do_you_manage_complex_state_models_ngrx_etc/)

When working with rather complex state models it becomes quite messy using the spread operator to partially update the state only. Also you lose with the spread operator the actual class instance.

For example my state model (just an example, not my real state)


```typescript
class Content {
    articles: Article[];
    //..
    getArticle(id: string) { return; }
}

class AppState {
    loggedIn: boolean;
    user: User;
    content: Content;
    uiState: UIState;
}
```

When doing action-&gt;state reduction you would have a reducer like this

```typescript
on(action, (state) =&gt; {
    return {...state, loggedIn: true, content: {...state.content, articles: articles};
}
```
where you basically lose class instances. That gets also more and more unsuitable the more my state model grows in complexity.
I wonder if there are libraries out there that help with this uses cases. Do you know any, or do you limit yourself to work with plain objects and a shallow store all the time? NgRx for examples write in their docs it's recommended to keep the store state as shallow as possible, and now I wonder if this is because of exactly this reason or if there is another reason involved here. Seems like an arbitrary limitation because they don't provide a library to easily patch frozen objects.

I ask because I created a solution for that which allows to patch frozen objects (by returning a new patched one which contains only updates where actual change happened), without using that dirty spread operator and wonder if there are other pitfalls.

My current code (which works for frozen states and returns a new one instead of modifying the original):

```typescript
on(action, (state) =&gt; {
    return applyPatch(state, state =&gt; {
        state.loggedIn = true;
        state.content.articles = articles;
    });
}
```

The mysql package allows you to make an SQL query with an arbitrary amount of statements. In my case, I've got a stored procedure with an OUT parameter:

    db.query('call getSalaries(1, 2, @average); select @average)'); // two statements

This would return an array where the first element is a Salary[] and the second element is an array of numbers (the average - though in this particular case, that array would contain a single number). In general, depending on the statements in the query and how many there are, I'm going to have an array of elements of different types, with corresponding length.

I would like to be able to call query in different ways. In general, if I call db.query&lt;A, B, C, ...etc&gt;(myQuery), then I know I'm going to get an array where the first element is A[], the second B[], the third C[], and so on. How would I go about modeling that?

I hope the question is clear. Thanks!

I think the `**` means "include everything". Below I was hoping excluding `__tests__` would take precedence over this broad match in include but it did not. How would you modify tsconfig to include everything in `src` except for folders and files inside `__tests__` ?

I could not quite come up with a valid use case to justify why typescript supports interface with indexers. plain javascript provides you with indexing objects then why one would need to define an indexer in an interface.?
