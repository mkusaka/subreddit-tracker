I've never enjoyed. building CRUD APIs in Go in fact I dislike it so much that I ended up creating up Creating Super Graph a Go library and standalone service that takes GraphQL and compiles it down to SQL. I'm currently helping a few startups adopt it and save hundreds of man hours that they can put towards more valuable parts of their app. It just occurred to be to leverage this community and extend this offer to more folks. Let me know if you think Super Graph is interesting and could help you with your app, startup, whatever I'm happy to provide some 1-on-1 time on Zoom, etc to make it work fo you. Disclaimer: Super Graph is not a startup or a funded project just a labour of love that I'm really excited about. Message me or reply on here if you want to take up on this offer.

Hi guys. I like to think I'm a fullstack dev, but I'm currently working on the Frontend in my workplace. I have done a few things with golang, but mostly crud stuff and validation. What other things can I do with golang to get really good at it on my own? . It's unlikely that my company will use Go, but I might be moving to a company that does in future. In short, what can I do on my personal time to improve my Golang and backend knowledge.
