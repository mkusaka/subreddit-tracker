The reddit post being a discussion on both the PR and the closing down of discussion in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be clear I do not want and am not attempting to discuss the content of the PR here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If both a PR gets closed down and reddit posts get deleted before the PR has even been merged / closed, how are we as a community supposed  to discuss changes related to the language? Or are we simply not expected to have a voice in these matters?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree that politics shouldn&amp;#39;t be discussed here, but when a change to the codebase is made off the back of a political and not technical decision (political meaning more non-technical than actually political), their needs to be a way to still discuss it.

"Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019m a scientist working in the field of nano-optics/-technology and at work we are regularly growing gold flakes -- thin platelets out of single-crystalline gold. How it works is still a bit of magic and a better understanding would be great.\n\n[Some real gold flakes.](https://preview.redd.it/7iil1whf8e951.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b7d211abc523654aa73e1329fd2f3d78b5c1e33)\n\nAs I got interested in Rust and had a lot of time during the last couple of months, I started implementing a simulation of the growing process in Rust. And it was a pleasure!\n\nThe main challenges were to find the right data structures for handling up to billions of atoms (in the end I used ndarray with some bitshifting/masking) at an acceptable speed (I settled with BTreeSet as a store for the surface vacancies) and also to deal with the fcc lattice and its arbitrary number of stacking faults of the gold crystals. I learned a lot about proper programming and important system details e.g. that the stack is limited to only a couple of megabytes or that the OS is really lazy when allocating memory. I wasn\u2019t able to get DTrace running on Windows, so no nice flame graphs here, but I believe the bottleneck is that there is no quick way to randomly pick an element from the BTreeSet. At least I didn\u2019t find one. If you have an idea, please tell me!\n\nThe code can be found at [Github](https://github.com/Rene-007/flake_growth), a [Wasm version](https://www.kullock.de/flake_growth/) is also available to get a first impression and I would recommend everybody to first have a look at the [visual guide](https://www.kullock.de/flake-growth-guide/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A short animation.](https://i.redd.it/stgdksuk8e951.gif)\n\nIn the end I have come to like the language, the tooling and the values behind Rust a lot! I think it is really the way to go forward for not only systems programming. Nevertheless, I had some difficulties and got some ideas I would like to share with you:\n\n* Initially it was quite difficult to get started because I missed the ability to play around with the data and e.g. see if my mapping from memory to the fcc lattice and back is right. It is not possible to write unit tests for that, and one must simply play around and see whether the results in the 3D scene fit or not. At work I usually use Matlab for things like that and it would be the much easier tool to figure out the mapping, but I deliberately decided not to do so. (During my PhD time I used python/numpy a lot and observed that it is (mentally) hard to switch to another language once you already invested a lot into your code. And when looking on examples such as the HipHop Virtual Machine others seems have the problem, too.) So, from my point of view it would be nice to have some \u201cplaying-around capabilities\u201d. I think I do not mean rapid prototyping with that but rather some small loop/block you can put into your program where the compiled code is interrupted by an interpreted section. When you run the program, you will end in the interpreter loop, have direct access to all the data structure/functions and can play around with them using the Rust syntax. So, no bindings or another language needed. I am not sure if that is feasible, but it would be cool.\n* The second issue circles around libraries. As a beginner/outsider it is hard to judge which library/crate is needed, which might be the best one, which one I can trust. I can sympathize with the decision to have a small and stable std library but have the feeling that there should be some additional \u201cmeta crate\u201d which combines the most popular matured crates in a complete way, i.e. that no additional external dependencies are needed. This crate should provide a root namespace (e.g. pop::rand or pop::serde), all unsafe parts should be reviewed  (with reports/discussion openly available) and some common programming standards (documentation, api design, naming) would also be good. It should be a big honor when \u201cyour crate\u201d gets part of this \u201cpopular crate\u201d or when you yourself become an approved reviewer. In contrast to the standard lib the API should guarantee compatibility only within a Rust edition such that subcrates, which are not state of the art anymore, can simply be removed. But as they will still live on as a separate crate, existing users just need the remove the \u201cpop::\u201d prefix within their source code. Smaller incompatible API changes within a subcrate might be introduced similar to linux in a \u201cpop.next\u201d meta-crate to smoothen the transition to the next edition. I think this might be a good compromise for a trustworthy base which is stable but not hammered in stone forever.
