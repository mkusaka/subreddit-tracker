Hi

I'm working on a [side project](https://github.com/customcommander/tagtical) and I'm looking for early feedback:

* Does it look useful?
* Any suggestions?
* Why would you not use it?
* etc.

Anything that can help me improve and grow ;-) Thanks!

### Use case: pluralisation

Depending on the value of `n` you need to produce a different text, e.g. "There is 1 fox", "There are 10 foxes", etc.

A typical implementation would be:

    `There ${n === 1 ? 'is' : 'are'} ${n} ${n === 1 ? 'fox' : 'foxes'}`
    //=&gt; e.g. "There is 1 fox"
    //=&gt; e.g. "There are 10 foxes"

Simple enough yet already difficult for the brain to parse. The code sort of hides the intent, which is a shame IMHO.

How about this?

    pluralize`There is/are ${n} fox(es)`;
    //=&gt; e.g. "There is 1 fox"
    //=&gt; e.g. "There are 10 foxes"

### Use case: default value

Similar concept; you can embed default values to use when their interpolated siblings are empty. The default values are removed from the string when they're not needed:

    defaults`Hi ${username}/guest, you have ${num}/no new emails`;
    //=&gt; e.g. "Hi John, you have 10 new emails"
    //=&gt; e.g. "Hi John, you have no new emails"
    //=&gt; e.g. "Hi guest, you have no new emails"
