I want to remove objects from an array if the `playerId` is already contained in that array.

Is there a smarter way to do this in TypeScript than my current implementation?

    private filterDuplicateLeaderBoardLines(result: Result): Result {
      const leaderBoardLines: LeaderBoardLineResult[] = [];
      const playerIds = new Set&lt;string&gt;();
    
      result.sessionResult.leaderBoardLines.forEach((leaderBoardLine: LeaderBoardLineResult) =&gt; {
        const playerId = leaderBoardLine.currentDriver.playerId;
        playerIds.add(playerId);
      });
    
      playerIds.forEach((playerId) =&gt; {
        leaderBoardLines.push(
          result.sessionResult.leaderBoardLines.find(
            (leaderBoardLine) =&gt; leaderBoardLine.currentDriver.playerId === playerId
          )
        );
      });
    
      result.sessionResult.leaderBoardLines = leaderBoardLines;
    
      return result;
    }

## [4][How to infer type of Array.prototype.map.call()?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i24akt/how_to_infer_type_of_arrayprototypemapcall/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i24akt/how_to_infer_type_of_arrayprototypemapcall/

It appears that TypeScript does not infer the return type of `Array.prototype.map.call()` -- it believes that it returns `unknown[]`.

```
let input: string[] = ["1", "2", "3"];
// OK
let result1: number[] = input.map(str =&gt; Number(str));
// error TS2322: Type 'unknown[]' is not assignable to type 'number[]'
let result2: number[] = Array.prototype.map.call(input, str =&gt; Number(str));
```

What can I do to make TypeScript correctly infer the type of `result2`? I'd rather not use type assertions to explicitly override the return type of `Array.prototype.map.call`.

(Running TypeScript 3.9.7, btw.)

Pretty new to this all just wondering if it's a good idea to gitignore the build folder all the JS gets rendered into?

Looked around on stack overflow and not a lot of guidance there. Thanks!
## [7][How do you generate, organize and maintain your seeds/fixtures data for integration or e2e testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i1nmsk/how_do_you_generate_organize_and_maintain_your/)

Hello all,

I'd like to write mainly e2e and integration tests but the main challenge to me is to put my system in a certain state.

I'm unable to find good resources about how to generate, organize and maintain fixtures / seeds data.

Everytime I need to start writing an e2e test this part is the most challenging.

I just want to know if there are better alternatives than manually writing your set of fixtures that you reuse and modify per test case.

Is reusing other parts of your own API to generate data in other tests a bad thing? Like imagine testing the case "As a user I can only see my own books", do you insert a user and books in the database directly before running the test or do you use your own API operations like "user register", "user add books" to populate the database?

Do you always start from an empty database or do you have a consistent set of data that you reset between tests? (The consistent set seems easier from a test preparation perspective but is also less explicit as you can't see the whole picture in the test case).
## [8][Problem exporting typings from a package: module is imported from 'package-name/build'](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i1ozwt/problem_exporting_typings_from_a_package_module/)

Hi, I'm having trouble configuring the package.json and tsconfig.json for a package with the following structure:

    package-name
        build               \
            lib             |
                index.js    |
            test            | tsc output
                specs.js    |
            index.js        /

        src                 \
            lib             |
                index.ts    |
            test            | source files
                specs.ts    |
            index.ts        /
        package.json
        tsconfig.json

When I'm trying to import something from such a package, the auto-import (I'm using Webstorm if that makes a difference)
is always something like `import { Something } from 'package-name/build';` while I would want it to be simply
`import { Something } from 'package-name';`.

Imports from `package-name/build` seems to work at runtime, but my IDE can not resolve it properly. If I manually fix
the import from `package-name/build` to `package-name`, my IDE can resolve the types and it also works fine at runtime.

I tried a lot of things with the `main` and `types` properties in the package.json, also with the `sourceRoot`,
`baseUrl` and `rootDir` properties in the tsconfig.json but to no avail, I never succeeded at making auto-imports be
imported from `package-name`.

You can try it yourself by pulling [this repo](https://gitlab.com/gpascal/export-types-example) (which uses yarn workspaces to link the packages locally):

    git clone https://gitlab.com/gpascal/export-types-example
    cd export-types-example
    yarn install

Then open the project in your IDE, go to `packages/package-import/src/lib/index.ts`, delete the import statement and try to auto-import `TestType` or `testFunction`.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

---------------------

For reference, the tsconfig.json and package.json look like this:

tsconfig.json:

    {
        "compileOnSave": true,
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "es2017",
            "module": "commonjs",
            "outDir": "build",
            "noImplicitAny": false,
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            "inlineSources": true,
            "inlineSourceMap": true
        },
        "include": ["src"]
    }

package.json:

    {
        "name": "package-name",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "main": "build/index.js",
        "types": "src/index.ts",
        "devDependencies": {
            "@types/node": "^14.0.27",
            "typescript": "^3.9.7"
        }
    }

Hey guys, javascript dev here. I've been looking through the Typescript documentation trying to understand why is everybody in love with this programming language.

Apart from the types in javascript and the abstract classes, what are the differences between JS and TS? Apart from the previously said stuff, why is it better to use TS rather than JS?

Thank you

## [11][How do I reference an object property by string?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i17xcj/how_do_i_reference_an_object_property_by_string/)

I've been stuck on this for some time trying to simplify my code.

I have an object for building a visualisation, it looks something like


```
const visualisation = {   
   ...   
  themes: {   
   hyper: {  
    ...  
}    
}  
```

The idea is that the theme is changeable, I have a dropdown where I have various values that match to the name of the themes.

When I reference my object though this works `visualiserThemes.themes['hyper']` and returns the correct object
However when I get a value as a string I cannot reference the object property anymore.
so this doesn't work
```const value = styleSelect.options[styleSelect.selectedIndex].value
```  
```
visualiserThemes.themes[value]
```  
where `value` is a string

Setting a custom const as a string manually though does work, like this

```
const value2 = 'hyper';
visualiserThemes.themes[value2]
```

The errors I'm getting 

```
Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type...  
No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type...
```

I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong, in both examples the value and value2 constants are strings but the former just errors out.
Sorry for the formatting, reddit has horrible code formatting.
