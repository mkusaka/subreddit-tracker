I just wanted to to have a discussion about how you guys mange your dependencies in package.json

I know that a lot of people just use the range operator \^ which is what npm uses by default.  
I  personally don't like it and use exact instead. I have been burned in the past by packages not following semver and breaking their libraries  in minor updates.

What do you use in your projects? What are your thoughts ?

ESLint is showing an error warning everywhere I do `Array[ index]` . For instance:

I have the following code:

    const myMap = { 1: [ ] , 2: [], 3: [] }  
    
    const index = getIndex()  
    
    myMap[ index ].push( 'hello' ) // -&gt; Generic Object Injection Sink Warning 

I know I can fix it by wrapping index into Number like `myMap[ Number(index) ].push( 'hello' )` or even   `\`${index}\`` would also work.

Is there any better way to fix it?
