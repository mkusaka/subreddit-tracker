Past month, I had to start working on Go because of a work project. I was pretty reluctant of moving to some other language, just because I was pretty comfortable with Java and I thought it has everything we need and is like the perfect language. When I started learning Go, I was immediately in love with this language. In the beginning, it was because of its simple syntactical design. One month later, I keep reading articles and watching videos of Go conferences and other concepts and more I go deep, more I keep falling in love with this language. It has even come to this that I don't wanna go back to Java and want to write everything in Go. Go standard libraries alone have so much to offer, feels like everything you need is already built-in and you don't need to go anywhere else. The amount of stuff related to Go I consumed in the past month is a lot but I still learn something interesting everyday. Sorry for the big rant.

Hello, everyone.

DId someone work with go-pg/migrations?

I want to do up migration. And after run \`go run \*.go up\` I have this error 

\`Migration's fail: pg: readSimpleQuery: unexpected message 'G'\`

I don't know what to do. I founded a part of code in go-pg repo where this error appears. 

This is repo   [https://github.com/go-pg/pg/blob/master/messages.go](https://github.com/go-pg/pg/blob/master/messages.go) 

line 673

But anyway I don't know how to solve it. Maybe I need add something in pg.Options.

My pg.Options \` pg.Options{  
   User:     "coreapiuser",  
 Password: "password",  
 Addr:     "localhost:5433",  
 Database: "coreapidb",  
} \`

I will be grateful for any answer. Thanks for attention

Hi everyone,

I would like to know if it is possible to get CPU and GPU temperatures in Windows 10. I got it on python by using WMI library and OpenHardware Monitor in order to write data on WMI.

Thanks in advance.
