Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

I found that video very intersting and how i hardly find any good content about networking programming with an use case in C++, i decided to share it here.

I've been very happily working almost exclusively in MATLAB for a bit over ten years now. Initially, I used did controls, but then switched over to computational mechanics and geometry. I've only very sparsely used Python when collaborating with others, and have used C++ in a very minimal capacity (just quick edits of inputs and parameters).

Due to the nature of what I'm working on these days, I've accepted that I just need to bite the bullet and learn C++ to a reasonable level of proficiency, and move my ongoing projects there.

While tutorials are good and fine, I feel I would really benefit from a succinct comparison of MATLAB and C++ syntax, data structures, and general best practices; a translation between one and the other, if you will. Does anyone know of such a thing? All I've been able to find are mostly hollow blog posts with too much SEO.

If anyone has any suggestions, thank you in advance!
