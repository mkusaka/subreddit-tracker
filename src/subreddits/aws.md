I can't describe how horrible this experience was.  I am not looking forward to how much work I am going to have to do to get my money back.  This is not my first AWS certification (I have SA Pro and DevOps Pro), but is my first online exam.  The short version is: Don't take AWS exams via the Pearson Vue at home option, even if it is offered.  AWS should not be offering this option as I can attest it is a waste of time.  Ironically, AWS would have us use their services because of their high availability and scaling but apparently they don't ask their test partners to do the same!

It started off easy enough: I passed the initial 'checks' as it confirmed my internet speed, camera access, and microphone access.  I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.  I tried again, and then a third time.  Same experience.  As I write this, I left it on that page and the spinning is continuing.  This screen has been spinning for no less than 45 minutes.  At 8 minutes before my scheduled exam, I tried finding the help link.  A chat window opened, and I waited, and waited, and waited.  Still waiting as I write this.  My chat window has been open for 52 minutes and still no one to help.  Every two minutes I get ' All agents are currently assisting others. Thank you for your patience.' written in the window.  OK - what next?  They make it harder to find, but I got a phone number I can call.  I tried calling that.  Busy signal.  For the next 20 minutes I called back and back, busy signal.  Finally, I got it to actually pick up, but of course no human yet.  No estimate of time to when I can be helped.  They don't even have nice elevator music to listen to.  Who knows when I will be able to talk to someone.  This has been an exceedingly poor experience.

If you value your time, please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt a online exam with Pearson.  I worked hard to prepare for this exam and rescheduled things to fit around it.  Now, I will have to do that all again.

u/jeffbarr Is this the experience AWS is hoping to get with their testing partners?  This was a waste of my time and money.  Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.

For what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.

*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.  I am actually quite surprised.

Hi all,

Can somebody please point me in the direction of a terraform example creating a cloudwatch event that is triggered by aws config rules that then targets a lambda function?

Cheers,

## [4][Amazon Workspaces - Setting up a user &amp; restricting user from installing programs](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hezeyj/amazon_workspaces_setting_up_a_user_restricting/)

Sorry, total noob here.

I just discovered Amazon workspaces and had no problem setting up a workspace for a remote worker.

However, I can't figure out how to add restrictions to that persons accounts.

For example:

I have their workspace set up.

I installed programs they need (nothing crazy, chrome, ringcentral)

That user on the workspace is an administrator.

How do I restrict that user and make them standard? I see I can change it from within windows but I can also change it back.

In short: I want to restrict the user from installing anything on the workspace.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for your help. I'm sure it's something really simple.
## [5][Packer + Ansible still relevant?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hf0z87/packer_ansible_still_relevant/)

Hi guys

Due to actions outside of my control I have been out of the workplace since February, previously I was working in DevOps (AWS) for a very long time.

I have enjoyed the enforced break but soon I want to get back on the wagon now as it were and I am looking to the people who are heavily involved in DevOps based around AWS for a little steer if you don't mind?

My question is, is Ansible + Packet still relevant in the market place in respect of building AMIs / automating deployments.

My last position used Packer + Ansible + Terraform to build AMI images (via GitLab automation pipelines), has anything changed here or is it still widely utilised?

Obviously Terraform is still used extensively, but any tips on what else I should be looking at?

The question I always had in my mind is is Jenkins still used more widely than GitLab for automation as well, or has this moved on to actual AWS pipelines themselves.

Thanks for any tips you can provide

Hi there, 

For various reasons I am making a lab in a private subnet. I want to be able to use Openvpn to access that lab and do things like ping instances, etc. 

I have set up OpenVPN in a public subnet, but I'm not sure what I need to do in order to get the service running. When I connect, I am unable to ping instances in the private subnet.

Does anyone have experience with this and possibly provide information and help?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance

We have Microservices hosted on Fargate via an ALB.  We set our Microservices' CORS policy to accept any origin, any method.  They are REST apis consumed by an SPA client.  However, about 10% of the time, we would get CORS errors.  We are new to AWS and not quite sure why this is happening.  Any tips or hints on what we should look at?  Thanks!
## [9][When using CloudFront OAI for serving static content stored in S3, can I restrict which path in the bucket CloudFront can access to?](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hexqnu/when_using_cloudfront_oai_for_serving_static/)

Can I allow CloudFront to read anything inside my-bucket/public, but disallow reading anything inside my-bucket/private?

I have files in S3 which I don't want to allow access without logging in my app. The app is hosted on EC2.

I don't want to allow access to S3 bucket directly even for public files because that would disable caching and optimized routing by CloudFront, and don't want to have another bucket just for public content.

Just curious. At the startup I work for, uses just one VPC for everything and we feel our design is secure and efficient. I understand big orgs might would have good use cases for multiple VPCs but I can't think of any myself
