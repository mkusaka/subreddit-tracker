## [6][Can you scaffold an entire React Application just by writing GraphQL Queries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/ipflq5/can_you_scaffold_an_entire_react_application_just/)

I've developed a new concept where we take Persisted Queries one step further.

Based on the Queries we might be able to scaffold UI components or event an entire Application.

Here's a quick example:

    query AllTasks($email: String! @fromClaim(name: "email"))
        @ui(page: "/tasks", component: TABLE)
    {
      queryTask(filter: {email: {eq: $email}}){
        ... @ui(linkTo: "/tasks/:id") {
            id @ui(columnName: "ID")
            title @ui(columnName: "Title")
            completed @ui(columnName: "Completed")
        }
      }
    }

There are a few questions I'd like to ask the community around this concept. We're mixing a lot of things together here. Data Fetching, Authorization and UI components, all in one view. Is this really something we should pursue? I see potential use cases for low code scenarios when you want to build Admin Dashboards but beyond that. I'm still not sure if this is a good idea. Would be great to hear your thoughts. If you want to get a bit more details on the idea here's a link to the full concept.

I'm using chakra-ui with react-hook-form. However, I am having trouble using the RadioGroup and Radio component from chakra as it seems to be missing the 'name' prop and hence I can seem to set the value of selected radio button. Can anyone please guide me with this?

We bought a camera to take a 360 picture of a product and we want to put it inside a React app module of sort. We currently have a demo, but it's using jQuery. I was wondering what were the easiest library in React I can use for this.

Hi everyone,

This is my first React app and it's sort of on the very beginner side. I'm a designer who wants to get better at bringing their projects to live so I used to use Frontend Mentor which is just a collection of coding challenges, Good Code is basically their alternative.  Also, would you say this is a good first React project? I know there really isn't any authentication or anything that makes an app, an app, but the dynamic part was really fun for me to make! :)

Let me know what you think and if there are any bugs that need fixing. 

So here's the React version (which isn't secure, it's on Netlify): [http://good-code.netlify.app/](http://good-code.netlify.app/)  
and here's the static version (which is secure): [https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode](https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode)
