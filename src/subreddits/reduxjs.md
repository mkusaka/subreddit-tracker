This is probably a weird question but as I trace through(console log execution) of events when loading a component that is using `mapStateToProps` the value I set in the reducer state is what I see on the immediate load of the component.

I have a case where there is a destructured "key" in the props that is the same name/key as an added prop from `mapStateToProps` so I'm wondering if this is expected or a clash/technically an error...

And testing if I take out the `key: val` entry in the reducer state, the destructured prop is still there but the value is undefined.

edit: here's a better idea of what I'm saying

`const componentName = (props) =&gt; {`

`const { isLoading } = props;`

`}`

`const mapStateToProps = state =&gt; ({`

`isLoading: state.reducerState.isLoading`

`})`

`// rest of dispatch/connect`

I don't know if this fully captures the issue, since we also have connected components going on, a main reducer/saga...

I made a small app that fetches restaurant data, displays it, and allows filtering and searching cities and all the usual stuff using useReducer and now I am trying to refactor it to use Redux. I am not using Redux ToolKit yet but I plan on learning it for my next project.

Anyway, I made my rootReducer, brought in Provider and createStore and hooked all that up but in Redux devtools I see Reddit's store for my user and not my app store. Here is my index.js code. And I did install redux and react-redux and I see it in package.json. I have not connected any components yet but should I not see my store in redux dev tools?

    ...
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import { rootReducer } from './reducers/rootReducer.js';
    
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
    
    ReactDOM.render(
      &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
        &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
          &lt;App /&gt;
        &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
      &lt;/Provider&gt;,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
    
    ...

Thanks in advance for nay help

 I was thinking that perhaps redux has too much indirection, maybe? I mean its a bit too much separation of concern with all the mapdispatch and mapstate and actions and reducers . If the point is to use a global store why not just import a singleton class and use its state with plain getters &amp; setters? or some other object with application level scope ?  Thanks in advance for reading and giving this some thought.Â

I've been hustling with this for a few days now and I can't find a satisfactory answer anywhere else.

I'm currently working as an Ethereum Dapp Engineer and the crypto ecosystem is known to have some very poorly implemented libraries which almost everyone depends upon.

I need multi-wallet support in my app and this is a lot of work for now. My team uses this library called [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react). It is a React-centric lib that allows for easy integration with different wallet providers.

To integrate this with Redux, I need to tap into it at the higher levels of my app and dispatch some actions. This way I can store the current connector and library in the store:

    function Initializer({ children }) {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();
      const web3React = useWeb3React();
      const { account, library, connector } = web3React;
    
      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        dispatch(
          changeProvider({
            connector,
            library,
           })
        );
      }, [connector, library, dispatch]);
    
      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        dispatch(changeAccount(account));
      }, [account, dispatch]);
    
      return children;
    }

**Problem #1**: `connector` and `library` are non-serializable and this is a NO-NO [according to the official style-guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide#do-not-put-non-serializable-values-in-state-or-actions).

Okay, let's find some place else for them to be.

**Approach #1:**

Since I'm using [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), by default it comes with `redux-thunk`.

I created the following thunk to deal with provider connection:

```
export const activateConnector = Object.assign(
  ({ activate, setError, connectorName }) =&gt; async (dispatch, getState) =&gt; {
    const currentConnectorName = selectConnectorName(getState());
    if (currentConnectorName === connectorName) {
      return;
    }

    try {
      dispatch(activateConnector.pending(connectorName));

      await activate(getConnector(connectorName), (err) =&gt; setError(err), true);

      dispatch(activateConnector.fulfilled(connectorName));
    } catch (err) {
      dispatch(activateConnector.rejected(err.message));
    }
  },
  {
    pending: createAction("web3/activateConnector/pending"),
    fulfilled: createAction("web3/activateConnector/fulfilled"),
    rejected: createAction("web3/activateConnector/rejected"),
  }
);
```

In this scenario, my other thunks depend on `library` (to be more precise, they depend on both on `library` and some smart contract instances that depend on `library`). Since I can't put it in the store, I thought about using `thunk.withExtraArgument` API.

**Problem #2:** `withExtraArgument` assumes the extra arg is resolved by the time the store is created. However, since the user can change the wallet provider at any time, I need a way to overwrite in runtime. That doesn't seem possible and [redux-thunk maintainers don't seem to eager to add such functionality](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/issues/277).

I managed to workaround that by injecting a mutable object in the thunk and using a custom middleware to change the reference whenever the library changes:

    const createApi = (library) =&gt; {
      return {
        // This is a contrived example. Most methods are not just a passthrough.
        async getBalance(account) {
          return library.getBalance(account);
        },
      };
    };
    
    const services = {
      api: new Proxy(
        {},
        {
          get: (target, prop, receiver) =&gt; {
            return () =&gt; Promise.reject(new Error("Not initialized"));
          },
        }
      ),
    };
    
    const store = configureStore({
      reducer: rootReducer,
      middleware: [
        // this should probably be exported from the web3Slice.js file
        (store) =&gt; (next) =&gt; (action) =&gt; {
          if (changeLibrary.match(action)) {
            services.api = createApi(action.payload);
            // do not forward this action
            return;
          }
    
          return next(action);
        },
        thunk.withExtraArgument(services),
        ...getDefaultMiddleware({
          thunk: false,
        }),
      ],
    });

The `Initializer` component is changed a little bit now:

    //...
      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        dispatch(
          activateConnector({
            connectorName: "network",
            activate,
            setError,
          })
        );
      }, [activate, dispatch, setError]);
    
      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        dispatch(changeAccount(account));
      }, [account, dispatch]);
    
      React.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        dispatch(changeLibrary(library));
      }, [library, dispatch]);
    // ...

**Problem #3:** While this solves the problem, this looks like a JavaScript-ey version of the Service Locator pattern (which many consider to be an anti-pattern).

It also just basically mutable global state, which could cause inconsistent state.

Imagine that I have thunk A and thunk B, which must perform sequential operations always as A -&gt; B. 

    const thunkA = () =&gt; async (dispatch, getState, { api }) =&gt; {
      // ...
      await api.doLongProcess();
    
      // ... dispatch some actions
    
      dispatch(thunkB());
    }
    
    const thunkB = () =&gt; async (dispatch, getState, { api }) =&gt; {
      await api.doOtherThing();
    }

While `api.doLongProcess` is in course, a `changeLibrary` event arrives. That will cause the `api` dependency to be changed, so what happens next is that when `thunkB` is called with the newer `api` instance. This is a big problem.

What I believe should happpen is that upon `api` change, all in-course operations depending on it should be cancelled. That is not an easy thing to pull out with this setup.

Does anyone have a suggestion on how to approach this?
## [6][Nullable state best practice (typescript) [redux toolkit, createSlice - set/allow state to be null ]](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/guns93/nullable_state_best_practice_typescript_redux/)

Hey!

I'm trying to create a slice in which its state can be null.

    import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    import { RootState, AppThunk } from 'app/store';
    interface GlobalErrorState {
        name?: string;
        message?: string;
        code?: string;
    }
    
    const initialState: GlobalErrorState|null= null;
    
    const globalErrorSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'globalError',
        initialState: initialState as (GlobalErrorState|null),
        reducers: {
            errorOccurred: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;CommonAPIError&gt;) =&gt; {
                return action.payload;
            },
            errorDismissed: (state) =&gt; {
                return null;
            },
        },
    }});
    

Then, taking advantage of useSelector in a component would look as below:

    const globalError = useSelector((state: RootState) =&gt; {
            return state.globalError;
    }, shallowEqual);
    if (globalError) {
            return &lt;CommonErrorPage message={globalError.message} /&gt;;
    }

Few questions regarding the abovementioned approach:

1. Is there any best practice for setting a state to null? Would it be better if the state had wrapped the error object? 

&amp;#8203;

    
interface GlobalErrorState {
        error?: {
            name?: string;
            message?: string;
            code?: string;
        };
    }
    
    const initialState: GlobalErrorState = {error:undefined};

2. For typescript experts - any other way to make the first example work without the 'as'?

    initialState: initialState as (GlobalErrorState|null)

Thank you!

 It just seems crazy to add so much boilerplate code for every data-fetching component. I've seen this pattern a lot. Any motives for it?It seems that simple ApiCall in componentDidMount / useEffect would work better...

This is a random conceptual question but  I was just thinking, at the end of the day when you launch something and you have static files, they're deployed on some website/app. What does Redux/reducer/actions become... just an object/methods?

Today I encountered interesting bug which was caused by action creators like this:

    export function setCartStatus(status) {
        return {
            type: setCartStatus.name,
            cartStatus: status
        }
    }

All creators had unique names, I checked this several times manually across all modules. All other components (store, reducers etc) were also ok â the problem is only in the code given above. Can you spot one?

Note: comments under the post mention solution.

Answer is under the spoiler: &gt;! webpack minimizes function names, and different functions from different modules may happen to have the same minimized name. !&lt;

Hey everyone! So for the last few weeks Iâve been designing and beginning to implement a GraphQL API using Prisma. Iâm at a stage where I have enough of an API foundation to think about developing frontend. Iâll be using react-native and I have a few questions regarding fetching data from my API. I want to be able to provide users with an offline experience and therefore require cache. I also want to use subscriptions (real-time functionality in GraphQL). Iâve found Apollo Client and seen that it has a lot of good reviews, however, Iâm not a huge fan of the built in React components that display the data. I havenât used them so I canât really be sure that I donât like them, however I donât think theyâll be great for query testing which isnât a huge deal since Iâll be thoroughly testing my API and Prisma is tested. On the other hand Iâve used redux in the past and am wondering if it has the possibly of acting as a sort of cache when paired with simple https requests. Any thoughts are appreciated! ð
