Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hey everyone, 
I am trying to mock a static function within a final class. I tried mocking it's behavior using mockkatatic(), but getting errors as my test is failing for Androids under API 28. 

Apparently, mockkatatic is only supported from API 28 and above.
Any workaround this one?

This is not a very recent project  but I never really posted anything about it here so here you go.

It's a cross-platform music streamer for [Android (Kotlin)](https://github.com/veezee-music/veezee-android)[/iOS (Swift)](https://github.com/veezee-music/veezee-ios)/[Web (Vue)](https://github.com/veezee-music/veezee-web).

Unlike most music player apps out there, this one is designed to work with a server that serves music files as well as a general API that has all the information required for apps functionality.

It uses ExoPlayer to stream audio files.

**You can either build it from source or just** [**download the prebuilt version here**](https://github.com/veezee-music/veezee-android/releases/download/1.2.1/app-release.apk)**.**

Anyways if you tried it, please tell me what you think about it.

I've been using retrofit now for years and I was wondering if there has been anything new come out? Looks like Retrofit is still the industry standard, however I was curious to see any new networking libraries.
