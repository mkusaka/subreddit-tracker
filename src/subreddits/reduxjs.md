Hi!  
I'm implementing a website with React Redux Saga and react router. I have a few pages where I need to display some cooking recipes. The recipe details like steps, ingredients, nutritional info and other stuff comes from the back-end.  
I want to use JsonLd schemas for better SEO (yeah, I know React is not the best tool for SEO) and I'm using React Helmet to add the required meta tags to each recipe page.  
My question is: Is it bad practice to have a SEO component that connects to the redux store and when the back-end responds with the data update the JsonLd schema?  
Thanks!

It seems like the suggested pattern to use is createSlice where actions and reducers have a 1:1 relationship based on the name/variable provided. createAsyncThunk seems to follow the same pattern.

Is there a way to write reducers (let's say for a different slice) to handle an action defined by createSlice/createAsyncThunk? Or would you have to write actions/reducers using createAction and createReducer?

## [8][Parent componentDidMount and child componentDidMount.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/hbbc6n/parent_componentdidmount_and_child/)

I am trying to teach myself Redux and I am having trouble with an assignment.  I'm trying to figure out how to let a child use componentDidMount without the whole component tree, it belongs to, re-rendering.
Here's are some pics to explain my problem:
When I click on the [todo item](https://imgur.com/5SJ3QFS) I expect it to open up and reveal the details of the todo item including the [steps](https://imgur.com/bhSL24w).  This does happen BUT I only see the steps flash for a second and I'm back to seeing only the [todo list item](https://imgur.com/5SJ3QFS).  The todo items(parents) are fetched just like the steps(children).

Please let me know if you need more information!!!

Here is my code...


Child component:


    class TodoViewDetail extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.props = props;
        }
        componentDidMount() {
            this.props.fetchSteps();
        }
        render() {
            const { body, id } = this.props.todo;
            return (
                &lt;div className="todo-details"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;{body}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;StepListContainer todoId={id} /&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={this.props.deleteTodo}&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            );
        }
    }

fetchSteps action:


    export const receiveSteps = (steps) =&gt;  ({
        type: RECEIVE_STEPS,
        steps: steps
    });
    export function fetchSteps(todoId) {
        return (dispatch, state) =&gt; {
            return stepAPIUtil.fetchSteps(todoId).then(
                    successfulStepsResponse =&gt; dispatch(receiveSteps(successfulStepsResponse)
                )
            )
        }
    }

ajax request:


    export function fetchSteps(todoId) {
        return $.ajax({
            type: "GET",
            url: `/api/todos/${todoId}/steps`,
        });
    }
