We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello! There is someone whoâ€™s able to create this app and show me the code? Iâ€™m havig a lot of issues and i want to see the correct version..

A web application, on a single page, based on React framework, shows informations about lasts crimes committed in the UK, based on data provided by British police.

This application need to have a bar containing a navigation menu and a larger area in which specific contents are presented.

the menu allows you to load the map and examine the distribution of crimes that occurred in the area of interest, switch to the statistical display or start a new query.

\- to make a query, a map of the united kingdom (using react leaflet) is displayed on the screen and it is possible to select a point of interest by clicking with the mouse. In the face of this action, the URL is queried: https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime/**lat**=&lt;lat&gt;&amp;**lng**=&lt;lng&gt; which returns a list of crimes committed nearby of the indicated point, which are shown in the form of markers superimposed on the map. making another click on a single point, a new query is made centered on the new points, the results of which replace the previous markers.

&amp;#x200B;

* clicking the single marker you access the second page, which shows the details of the crime (for a detailed description of the individual fields, see the document published on the URL: [https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crime-street/](https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crime-street/))

\- going to the statistical view, one or more graphs will be shown that can summarize the types of crimes returned by the last query (if any). the list of crimes can be found at the URL: https://data.police.uk/api/crime-categories

Guess this is more JS related question than a React specific problem, but asking in case there might be a solution with react router.

I am using `location.hash = "test"` to add hash parameter to the url. However, this causes a page refresh. Is there any possibility to do that without refreshing the page? Through react-router api or with vanilla JS?

## [11][Can anyone explain how shouldComponentUpdate method in parent component affects child component re-rendering in React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f73uhb/can_anyone_explain_how_shouldcomponentupdate/)

I am new to React. React document says that returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when *their* state changes.  Can anyone give an example that best describes this scenario.

Sorry if this question seems to be basic. But I really want to know how it works. 

Thanks in advance.
## [12][When is it unnecessary to make a copy of state?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/f739j7/when_is_it_unnecessary_to_make_a_copy_of_state/)

I've been under the impression that you always need to make a copy of state so you don't mutate the original state. **In what scenarios is it ok to modify state without making a copy?**

Still a noob and I've basically been making copies of state every time. Here's an example I'm unsure of:

     const [fill, setFill] = useState([
        { fill: 0 },
        { fill: 0 },
        { fill: 0 },
        { fill: 0 }
      ]);
     &lt;TouchableOpacity
                style={styles.listContainer}
                onPress={() =&gt; {
                  setFill(prevState =&gt; {
                    let stateCopy = [...prevState];
                    stateCopy[index].fill = stateCopy[index].fill + 100;
                    return stateCopy;
                  });
                }}
              &gt;
    &lt;AnimatedCircularProgress
                    key={`circular${index}`}
                    size={60}
                    width={10}
                    fill={fill[index].fill}
                    tintColor="yellow"
                    backgroundColor="#3d5875"
                  /&gt;
    &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;
