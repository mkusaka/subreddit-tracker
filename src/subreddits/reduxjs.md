Ive been struggling to find a good answer/explanation to this.  


what does the '...' mean in the redux initial state reducer method.

EXAMPLE:

&amp;#x200B;

 `export default function (state = {} , action) {`

`switch(action.type) {` 

`case GET_ORDER_STATUS:` 

`return { ...state, orderStatusData: action.payload.orderStatus };`   


`default: return state; }` 

`}`

Up until now I've only used Axios (fetch) requests from an API in my actions. What if I just want to change the Redux state from a React component like \`logout\`? If my function to \`logout()\` looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    logout = () =&gt; {localStorage.clear();this.props.clearCurrentUser()}

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and my Reducer looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    const initialState = {currentUser: [],};
    
    export const currentUserReducer = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; {
    switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_CURRENT_USER":
    return { ...state, currentUser: action.payload }
    case "GET_CURRENT_USER":
    return { ...state, currentUser: action.payload }
    case "CLEAR_CURRENT_USER":
    return { ...state, currentUser: null }
    default:
    return state;}};

&amp;#x200B;

How do I write this in an \`action\`?

Hello,

I am very new to coding in general. While i was coding in react, I noticed I can use redux to have a global state. However, I am not too sure when I should use redux instead of just passing down props.

I have a component which has 2 layered 2 components. Something like this:

&gt; A  
&gt;  
&gt;/\\  
&gt;  
&gt;BC  
&gt;  
&gt;||  
&gt;  
&gt;DE

Should I be using redux if I want to communicate between D and E?  Also, what are the pros and cons of using redux? (such as performance) How would I know when to use redux or just pass down props?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the comments in advance
## [5][Why use separate constants for action types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reduxjs/comments/g9pb5n/why_use_separate_constants_for_action_types/)

Relatively new to Redux. I'm familiar with the points as [why to use action creators](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2016/10/idiomatic-redux-why-use-action-creators/), but I often see action types set up as a separate set of constants ([here's a basic example from a tutorial](https://github.com/rhysdavies1994/koa-react-todo-tutorial/blob/master/frontend/src/actions/todos.js)) rather than just declared directly in the action creator. The logic of why this is needed is less clear to me - I've heard it is to minimize typos, but as far as I can tell, it's just a bunch more typing and importing and exporting things, without fundamentally affecting what an action creator is doing.

Can someone explain, ideally with an example, why it is considered a good practice to do this? Or, in what situations is it important / not-so-important?

No action, connection or other boilerplates with [redux-path](https://github.com/beauvaisbruno/redux-path).
~~~~
dispatchTo('foo/sub', value);
getFrom('foo/sub');

## Basic example
~~~~
const Component = () =&gt; {
  const sub = useSelector(state =&gt; state.foo.sub);
  return &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div onClick={() =&gt; dispatchTo('foo/sub', sub + 1)}&gt;
      Click to increment
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div onClick={() =&gt; dispatchTo('foo', {sub: getFrom('foo/sub') + 1})}&gt;
      Click to increment
    &lt;/div&gt;
    foo.sub: &lt;&gt;{sub}&lt;/&gt;

 I'm trying to conditionally render my **redux app** based on if the user is logged in. The relevant &amp; condensed version of my code is below:

    let isLoggedIn = false;
    
    export default function App() {
      console.log('App Executing...');
      console.log('isLoggedIn: ', isLoggedIn);
      return (
        &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
          &lt;NavigationContainer&gt;
            {isLoggedIn ? ContactsTab() : Login()}
          &lt;/NavigationContainer&gt;
        &lt;/Provider&gt;
      );
    }
    
    store.subscribe(() =&gt; {
      // Set isLoggedIn to true if token is received and reinvoke App()
      if (store.getState().user.token) {
        isLoggedIn = true;
        App();
      }
    });

The app starts with console logging **isLoggedIn: false** and displaying **Login()**(as expected). When I login on my phone using the correct credentials, **App()** is re-invoked console logging **isLoggedIn: true**(as expected) but it's still displaying **Login()**. If I set **isLoggedIn = true** inside the app function, the app successfully starts displaying the **ContactsTab()**.

What is happening here? Why is my app not moving to **ContactsTab()** when the value of **isLoggedIn** successfully changes to **true**? How can I fix this?

Thank you for reading along. I have been trying to debug this for the past 2 days with no success so any help would be greatly appreciated!

Built with React / Redux on the Frontend and Django Rest on the backend. I have been keeping a journal since I was a kid. Sheltering in place has afforded me some extra time to develop an app to support my hobby of journaling. You don't have to sign up to start using it. I use the localStorage API to cache things locally. If you want to use the Django backend to sync journal entries between devices then that will require you to sign up. I hope you guys / gals enjoy! Stay safe out there!

It is now the standard for writing redux logic.

I've been using redux-toolkit for 3 months and I am enjoying it so much! it simply boosts the productivity üî•

It makes your code shorter and easier to understand and enforces you to follow best practice (normalizing, selectors, typing, etc‚Ä¶ )
