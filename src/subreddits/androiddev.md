* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi guys ,

If you are someone who develop apps and release them on play store , i want to know how do you guys deal with app crashes , i mean you releasing an app update just to find out within a week u find some crashes and if u fix that and release an update again this cycle keeps repeating 

Even after quality testing , using firebase test lab i keep getting some crashes , it's very stressful and i want to know how do u guys deal with it mentally knowing that there are 100's of users who may experince this crash , who may uninstall app after this.

Hi Everyone!
I have created an Android Application which is gets stolen. Someone just copied my application and he changed some images and overall theme of my application and posted it on Play Store and it gets published. Not a single code he changed even on some places my account name BIG DREAMS TEAM still visible. When I reported about it google ask me to send a copy of court order to remove app from store.
Anyone have any idea what should I do?
And I am not the only one on that account more than 25 apps are published which are stolen.
Also any suggestions would be very helpful, that what can I do on code level to protect my apps and updates in future.
## [6][lock screen controls for audio player app](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fbc6sp/lock_screen_controls_for_audio_player_app/)

I'm building ios and android versions of a simple music player.  the audio has the ability to play in the background (eg: when the user presses the power button to turn the screen off and put the phone in their pocket).  then when the user takes the phone out of their pocket and presses the power button, we see the lock screen.  on the iphone, it was super super easy to add transport controls (using MPRemoteCommandCenter) and song info (using MPNowPlayingInfoCenter) to the lock screen so that the user could see what song is playing and they can skip to the next song and play/pause, etc.  for android though, i am having a tough time figuring out how to do this.  my app is simple: it's just an activity with a MediaPlayer.  It \*seems\* like what I need to do is create a notification of some kind that will display the controls and the info, but I don't see how to launch that notification when the phone displays the lock screen.  Also, the transport controls seem to be implemented in a client / server kind of way, but my app is currently \*not\* set up as a client / server model.

So, my questions for the android dev community are: (1) is there a simple way to do this that i am missing? i've spent a lot of time looking for solutions, but haven't found anything straightforward like i found for ios;  (2) do i need to rewrite my app to be a client / server?  from what i've found, it seems like the way to do that is to make the music player core the server and then the ui is the client.  this seems obtuse and overkill to me, but if it's the only way for me to get controls and info on the lockscreen, then i'll go ahead and do it.

Thanks. :)

I went to `Settings-&gt;Editor-&gt;Layout Editor` but it only has "Prefer XML editor" checkbox, which means it'll either open the Design view, or Code view, but not split view. Is there any way I can make it open Split view by default?

Hi guys, I've been trying to publish an App that parses messages received for a Mobile Banking platform in Kenya called MPesa. Essentially the app parses SMS messages received from "MPESA" the displays your transactions in an easy to digest format. 

But after finishing the app I discovered that in order to publish your app which reads messages you have to register as the default message handler... This is not the purpose of the app. All data is stored locally on the device, thus the app does not require internet connection. So no data can be sent out.

I've tried contacting Google explaining my use case but have not heard anything for weeks.. 

Does anyone have any ideas?

Does anyone with Unity experience know of a solution to this? I can't seem to find any recent ones or answers that aren't outdated.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31041031/black-screen-unity-subview-in-android

All the answers I've tried is giving me a blackscreen. Someone suggested that it could be a unity issue because they reworked the whole Android-Integration in version 2019.3.0.

Hey everyone :).

I have been developing android apps for quite some time, but never released anything outside EU.

Now I am building a flutter app, and I was talking to my friend who is currently in Bali. So I wanted to show him my new app, and send him the APK which works perfectly fine in EU and US on the same Phone (Pixel 2). But in Bali it crashes as soon as it should connect to Firebase/my cloud (currently only on a Europe server). He used VPN, no change. Android 10 is the OS on my Pixel2 and on his. Same build number as well.

I love my App and it can be used everywhere on the world and is also kind of intended to be working wherever you go, so how can I tackle that issue? 

What could even be the reason for this behavior? 

Has anyone experience in releasing a "worldwide" (minus China, etc.) app?  

Greetings,
