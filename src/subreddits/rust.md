Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gr3r32/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hey everyone!

What is [Pushrod](https://www.github.com/KenSuenobu/pushrod/)?  It is a library that is written for GUI applications, written in Rust from the ground up using the SDL2 library for its graphics libraries and OS event handling.

The following new items have been added since the last update post ...

- A base widget library containing a button, checkbox, grid, group box, image button, image, progress, text, and toggle buttons have all been created.
- Test applications have been created to test all of the functionality of the widgets mentioned above.

I had a previous version of this library, called [rust-pushrod](https://www.github.com/KenSuenobu/rust-pushrod/) that was being worked on.  However, its design was too limiting, making it difficult to add additional widgets to the display, and was partially hampered by some bad internal design.

This new version uses a more recognized event-based system (similar to Atari, Amiga, and early Windows-based programming), making it easier to implement a main event loop to intercept actions.

I will be working on the Wiki for the site, and may be making some Youtube content to help show examples and some step-by-step instructions on how to create applications, or even your own Widgets from scratch.

It's a one-man-show right now, and I could also [use some donations](https://www.patreon.com/KenSuenobu) if you feel like contributing to the cause!  (I also like coffee.)

The library is made up of [Pushrod](https://www.github.com/KenSuenobu/pushrod/) and [Pushrod-Widgets](https://www.github.com/KenSuenobu/pushrod-widgets/).  I am also creating a GUI builder called [Chassis](https://www.github.com/KenSuenobu/pushrod-chassis/) which is currently a WIP.  Anyone who used "Interface" on the Atari ST or KIDE for the KDE library will be familiar with this type of application.

Thanks, and I look forward to feedback - positive or negative!

## [12][Rust seems like the most consistent language I've ever used? What's inconsistent about it from your experience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gvqhea/rust_seems_like_the_most_consistent_language_ive/)

Almost every language I've encountered there have been plenty of questionable (but understandable) decisions (cpp no ABI break , vector&lt;bool&gt;, pythons GIL, java type erasure on generics, etc.). I've yet to encounter a single issue like that in Rust. Everything about it seems consistent and have one and only one way to do it and if there is another way to do something, it seems fulfills a very specific purpose.

To be honest, I'm almost certain there must be some problems like the ones mentioned earlier though so I'd like to hear them.
