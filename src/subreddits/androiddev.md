Hey, AndroidDev, 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone tell me what data structures an Android Developer should be familiar with that can help in Android Development?

They use copyrighted material correct? How in the world are these apps still up making money? I only bring this up because I thought of making a simple soundboard app but realized it will get blocked due to copyright infringement

Long Version:

During these last couple weeks I have been home because of the COVID-19 so basically I got bored and decided to make a little program which I thought would help me and my department out which is inventory.  (office position soon).  This program basically calculates the production materials needed for next days production and displays to the user the part numbers and exact amount of materials is needed to prepare, all the user has to do is input 3 entries, it's meant to be simple for the user.  I got it up and running enough to get my idea across.  So when I got back to work on Monday I showed a handful of my co workers and my former manager as well and every single one of them was impressed and thought it was a smart idea.  Then I finally showed MY boss and she was very impressed with it,  the look on her face she looked when she saw the programs results and the way she held my phone you could tell she was really impressed with what I have done. (I used AIDE to run my cpp file on my phone but I don't wanna use that for the final program).  

She really wants me to finish it because she knows it will be a huge help for her and the department. It just makes calculations a lot easier than having to use a calculator every single time every day for every material part number.  I am totally up for the task and I  technically got the hard part out of the way, its just a material calculator that handles user input with ints and strings, nothing crazy. I told her I don't know how to turn it in to an app and that I'm just able to run it as a console program and she was totally cool with it because I got my idea across with one demonstration.  I was able to turn my cpp file into a executable file, and place a shortcut on my windows laptop through the command prompt so isn't there a similar way to do it for android as well? 

Coding Background:

 I started coding back in 2014, I started with Python and C++, I have taken college courses in both python, python gaming and just recently last semester I took intro to C++ and I was one of the 3 that passed the class. So I don't think I'm ignorant with programming I do have a strong grasp for it, C++ is mainly the language I know well the most.  At the same time I haven't really made anything cool or groundbreaking but I can code.  Also would it be a good idea to sell my little program to my company for a one time fee once its complete?   It wouldn't hurt to ask right?  If so how much? Just for a start, I would like to make programming into a career some day.

&amp;#x200B;

Short Version:

I just want the program to be a clickable icon on the home screen on the tablet so it runs automatically like an app per say.  On my windows pc I was able to turn my cpp file into a executable and place a shortcut on the desktop home screen to quickly run the program, so is there a way to do this as well for android?

I have downloaded and installed drivers from [Samsung page](https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html) , but this not helped. Connecting to other USB port also not helps. How to solve this problem?
## [12][Android Room search from a list of strings](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ftkgy7/android_room_search_from_a_list_of_strings/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ftkgy7/android_room_search_from_a_list_of_strings/
---
I have a database setup using Room. Now there is a 'title' column. The user can query a list of strings at once. The query should return all the rows which have any of the strings from the list as a substring in the title.
Ex. 
The list given by user :    ['shoe', 'go']
A row's title:     "The good shoelace"

So the query should return the given row.

I was thinking if there is a way to use 'LIKE' and 'IN'  keywords together for this purpose but I haven't been able to find anything. 
Please help me create a query for the above explanation.
