2020 is a being a very rich year for Rails **boilerplates and generators**. I've written a short article describing the most prominent ones: [https://blog.corsego.com/2020/10/ruby-on-rails-templates-and-generators.html](https://blog.corsego.com/2020/10/ruby-on-rails-templates-and-generators.html)

I have a table with a "status" string column where the values are either "pending" or "complete" and I'd like to know if there is a way to basically display two tables where each iterates each "status" value

EDIT: 
Only thing I've tried is:

model.where("column" =&gt; 'string') do 
end

EDIT 2: 
Okay I figured it out, all i dead was put the .each at the end

Hello good people,  


Having read through this post from yesterday and today:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jeo0xy/where\_do\_people\_host\_their\_rails\_6\_apps\_in\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jeo0xy/where_do_people_host_their_rails_6_apps_in_2020/)  


I thought I would pose a similar question, I run a website ([https://www.marincricketclub.com/](https://www.marincricketclub.com/)) for a sports club I'm a part of, our website lays mostly dormant for 5 months a year and the rest of the year, we would be lucky if we got 500 hits a month.   


We are a non profit so any way I can reduce cost is great! We use Heroku Hobby dyno's at $7 per month and they have been more than adequate for our use case and been zero hassle as well.  


But, after reading the above thread and having done some other research on my own, I believe I can save us some money by moving to the Digital Ocean App Marketplace (probably $5 per month) or Google Cloud Services which based on our use case, should be free or worst case scenario maybe cost $1 a month and this would include our attached storage bucket.   


I'm about to rebuild the existing site and have put together a (mostly) static site to serve as a place holder until the next season gets closer. Going forward, the app will send email, have an active storage solution and I want to get the deploy situation sorted now.  


So any advice, ideas or suggestions are very appreciated!

## [8][Same base project in three different instances. What do you suggest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/jfa5h0/same_base_project_in_three_different_instances/)

Let's say you have the project X which is a simple Rails app. It's open source in github. 

Then you decide you will host the project on a custom VPS with capistrano for example and sell it to people as a SaaS. 

And then, you build another instance with small differences and sell it as a business app on a different domain. 

What is the right way to accomplish that without going crazy? 

The use case is that I've build an app and I want to try and see If it gets any customers. It will have two plans, a personal and a business one. Obviously, the differences with the open source app would be to have extra models as `subscriptions` and more security. 

Should I keep the same *Core* and build everything else on top of gems and engines ? Or is there any other common solution I am missing ?

Thanks in advance!

I'm setting up my API, and its only returning one table -- when it should be including the nested relationships between my models. There are at least 6 different other relationships that I want to include with my initial api request. The are nested attributes for the provider\_form.

**api.rb**

&amp;#x200B;

`require 'grape-entity'`

`module Sims`

`class API &lt; Grape::API`

   `format :json`

   `prefix :api`

  `version 'v1', :path`

 `mount Sims::V1::ProviderForms`

 `end`

`end`

&amp;#x200B;

**provider\_form.rb**

`module Sims`

 `module V1`

  `class ProviderForms &lt; Sims::API`

  `include Grape::Kamari`

 `params do` 

   `use :pagination, per_page: 20, max_per_page: 30`

 `resources :provider_forms do`

 `desc 'return provider forms'` 

 `get do`

`present paginate(ProviderForm.all), with: PersonalInfoEntity`

`end` 

`end`

&amp;#x200B;

**personal\_info\_entity.rb**

`class PersonalInfoEntity &lt; Grape::Entity`

`expose :personal_info do`

`expose :first_name`

`expose :last_name`

  `end`

`end`

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**provider\_form.rb**

`has_one :personal_info, dependent: :destroy`

**personal\_info.rb**

`belongs_to :provider_form`

I am trying to build a stripped down version of a spree type application to learn. In my product form I want to be able to attached option\_types to it. I do this by having a select field that has select2 on it. I choose the option types needed from the list and it adds them in as a sort of tags type text field. I think it should come out in the form params as a comma delimited field based on how I have it set up. 

When I update a product after I have selected some option types the product updates but I am getting the following error on an unpermitted parameter:

 As the default configuration, a user called postgres is made and the user postgres has full superadmin access to the entire PostgreSQL instance running on your OS.The default Postgres user is postgres and a password is not required for authentication. Thus, to add a password, we must first login and connect as the postgres user   


In a new rails project, whenever I perform rake db it either tells me: 

 `peer authentication failed for user 'postgres'` or `no password supplied for postgres`

I shouldnt have to necessarily touch `pg_hba.conf` file or \password
