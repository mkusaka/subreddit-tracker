Hi Kotliners,

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with Kotlin full-stack for web development projects. I've just started looking into Thinkter (basically Ktor + React in kotlin, [https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-fullstack-sample](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-fullstack-sample)), but I'm not really sure if it's a true alternative to JS-based technologies.

I previously used JSNode, Express, React + JSX + Redux, Axios andÂ Babel. It worked nice, but coming from the mobile software development, I really missed Kotlin and dynamic typing really killed me, I just never got used to it. Although I haven't been using it for that long, so I might one day, but if I could, I'd switch to Kotlin without ever looking back.

So, what are your opinions / do you have any experience with Kotlin in full-stack web development?

I am starting a large project in Kotlin and using Ktor for my API. I am now wondering what the de-facto robust job queue system is in the Java world, something akin to Sidekiq in Ruby?

I can't find much Kotlin-specific, and am even having trouble finding Java stuff. Everywhere I look (including many posts on this subreddit and Java) mention threads or coroutines and such.. which doesn't even begin to approach the requirements of a proper job queue system. I can only assume I am missing something fundamental in my shift from separate background worker processes and what folks do on the JVM.

What do people use to track their background jobs, add retries, back-offs, persist for pause/resume between process restarts, etc, etc?
