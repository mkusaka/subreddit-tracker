Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fc7h20/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Suppose I have a struct `BoolPadded`

    struct BoolPadded {
        _x: u16,
        _y: u8,
        _z: bool,
    }

Then `Option&lt;BoolPadded&gt;` takes up 4 bytes in memory. I assume this is because the compiler is smart enough to use the invalid bit patterns of `bool` to represent the enum tag of `Option&lt;T&gt;`.

However, if I remove the bool member:

    struct Unpadded {
        _x: u16,
        _y: u8,
    }

Now `Option&lt;Unpadded&gt;` takes up 6 bytes in memory. It seems as though now the compiler can't determine that `Unpadded`, when aligned at a 2-byte boundary, will have unused padding bits at the end.

Is there some sort of memory layout or ABI stability guarantee that is preventing this kind of optimization?

Markup languages like *Markdown*, *ReStructuredText*, *asciidoc*, *textile*,
*txt2tags* or *mediawiki* are perfectly suited for fast note-taking. Type
your notes with your favourite editor and chose your favourite markup
language[^1].

_Tp-Note_ helps you to quickly get started writing notes with its powerful
template system. As _Tp-Note_ takes care that the note's filename is always
synchronized with its document title, you will find back your notes easily.

_Tp-Note_ is available for Linux, Windows and iOS. The manual illustrates
its main use-cases and how to get started:

1. Fast start note-taking (when the lecture starts).
2. Take a note about an existing (downloaded) file.
3. Bookmark and comment a hyperlink.

If you want to customize _Tp-Note_ with own templates, another markup
language, please consult the [man-page] for more technical details.

The project is hosted on Github:
[getreu/tp-note](https://github.com/getreu/tp-note). The project's webpage is on
[http://blog.getreu.net](http://blog.getreu.net/projects/tp-note/).

In a project I'm working on I have a few lines of code like this:

    str::from_utf8(&amp;string_bytes).map_err(
        |utf8_err| DeserializationError::InvalidUTF8(utf8_err),
    )?

where `DeserializationError` is an enum and `InvalidUTF8` is a tuple variant. Clippy corrected this to the following, which also compiles:

    str::from_utf8(&amp;string_bytes)
        .map_err(DeserializationError::InvalidUTF8)?

`map_err` takes a `FnOnce(E) -&gt; F` , so I was curious why the name of the enum variant also works. Is the construction of a tuple variant like calling a function? Yes, as it turns out!

From [this 2017 thread](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/enum-variants-and-newtype-as-functions-closures/14706) in the rust-lang users forum:

&gt;Unit structs, newtypes and tuple structs all live simultaneously in both  the type/module namespace and the value/function namespace.  Only standard, braced structs live exclusively in the type/module namespace.

    struct Unit; // exists as a value
    struct Unit2(); // exists in value namespace as a 0-arg function
    struct Newtype(u8); // exists in value namespace as a 1-arg function
    struct Tuple(u8, u8); // exists in value namespace as a 2-arg function
    struct Regular { value: u8 }
    
    // fn Unit() {} // the name `Unit` is defined multiple times
    // fn Unit2() {} // the name `Unit2` is defined multiple times
    // fn Newtype() {} // the name `Newtype` is defined multiple times
    // fn Tuple() {} // the name `Tuple` is defined multiple times
    fn Regular() {} // ok

Thought that was a neat syntactical coincidence, though it tripped me up for a second.
