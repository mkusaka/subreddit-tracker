This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Hi!

I made this simple application to show some basic concepts like a smooth change of background in a ViewPager and a very simple API I made. I thought it may help some people working with some of these.The idea is that everyday the app shows you a Leaf thats like a interesting quote.

Everyone can publish and It shows a new Leaf every day.

Right now its showing a quote from a book I love called "The way of kings - Brandon Sanderson" .
