[AskJS] Hey guys, I'm gonna try to keep this short.
I have 1 year of experience with HTML CSS and JS and I also know Sass and a little bit of ReactJS(enough to make a full website out of it). Anyway i live in england and i live in a city where there isn't much JS jobs. I want some kind of real life experience, I'm looking for jobs but nobody wants me since i have a light experience, im down to work for the minimum required im down for internships or basically anything that will give me some experience  I guess I'm looking for an advice what should be my next move? How can I get experience when nobody wants someone who is unexperienced? Any websited that couls help me? Thanks in advance. :)
