I have been working on few web applications in Go but I don't really have the time to find out the "best" places to host my applications. I'd love to know if people here know any.

I know of the online gopher creator sites and those are cool, but I want a custom one drawn for me. Anyone have this done or know of a good resource?

Do I just go to one of the 'hire an artist' sites or is there someone we've identified on these threads who is good?

My ultimate goal is, of course, to turn it into a plushie and post it here. ;)
