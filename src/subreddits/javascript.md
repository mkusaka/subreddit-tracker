Hi. I have been coding for 7 years making premium plugins for WordPress. All that years i did not have a mentor and that slows down things a lot. Last few years i am focusing on JS and high quality development using a modern workflow and proper debugging. I wish to practice somewhere in an open source project with tests. My goal is to become a better developer to get a job offer or make enough money to emigrate from my country.

Do you know a good designed project that i could join to practice and get my code reviewed? I have never contributed anywhere so i am completely a newbie in it.

[AskJS]
Hey people!

I am testing our web app and i notice to long numbers in JavaScript, those values are being change almost the same number but adding zeroes at the end without not reason.

There is some explantion?

Example:

Console.info(" look here this -&gt; ", 1234567891234567891)

Output look here this -&gt; 1234567891234568000

Why this is happening? There is a known issue in Js?
