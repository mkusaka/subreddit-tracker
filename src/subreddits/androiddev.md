This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

So my first app I built/am building with Java and traditional android views and I found the experience to be a bit painful (java is very verbose, compiling takes ages, themes and animations are a pain in the ass etc)

So now I'm interested in starting another app and maybe porting my current app to better tech but there seems to be two competing technologies? Dart+flutter and Kotlin+jetpack? Is that right? Why do both exist and which is better to learn? I like the idea of Flutter if it's cross platform but then why does Kotlin+Jetpack exist, does Flutter have limitations on native apps? Is Flutter something Google is likely to drop because it's not as popular? etc

Thanks for your advice and sorry if this is a stupid question.

For my 1 year old app, it is always 200-300 downloads per day. From 10k+ to 50k+ to 100k+, daily downloads never grow. I think it is controlled by some sort of algorithms. Once my app got 200-300 downloads everyday, Google Play will stop recommending it to users. (Possibly in similar app section) What can I do to get more downloads?

Started learning android for college project recently.
I have created an sms app which is capable of being a default app(minimalistic app though). When I set it to default sms app, my phone's inbuilt ap stopped receiving new messages. 
Questions:

1. Do all new messages automatically go in content://sms/inbox or do we have to update it manually ? I am asking this because my inbuilt sms app doesn't reflect the sms recieved while it was not  default sms app.

2. Is it necessary to forward new messages to other apps listening for new sms received?

Which process/action/library or anything (any part of the dev process) causes you the most frustration or what part of the dev process feels like a chore?

Just really interested in hearing as many different opinions or points of view as possible on this front?  


Edit: Sorry folks turned out i accidentally posted this same post 5 times on this sub-reddit, totally did not mean to do that, not sure what happened! So just incase you responded to one of the other posts i removed the duplicates, sorry about that! Great answers so far folks!

Hi,

Just a question about Android Studio Emulator. I have an Advanced Protection account that requires hardware FIDO U2F security key. Can the emulator do a USB passthrough for the AVD to detect the security key?

Thank you!

I have good programming knowledge and have worked on many ML and Web development projects. I want to get into app development now and so I wanted to know that can I develop an entire android app with anything other than JAVA. The problem is that I hate JAVA and I don't want to do anything with that language. So can I build an entire android app with languages like  C++/Python/Javascript etc.? Also, I want to build something that can be released on play store so please don't suggest webapps or anything that can't be released on play store. Thanks.

I am developing an android app in which I want to load data from my custom JSON and after play it from YouTube official recommended method. Cause list of videos are from different different sources that's why it is necessary to make custom JSON. Does this get me banned on Playstore? Does anyone have any experience about it?
## [11][Google Play Beta Ratings &amp; different languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hournx/google_play_beta_ratings_different_languages/)

I just received a 3 star review saying *"Fun game but you need to translate into different languages."* I'm just a solo dev and my app has probably 10,000 words in different forms, so translating into even one other language would be difficult and expensive.  


I have a couple of questions which I can't find answers for in Google's documentation. My game is currently in open beta.

**Q1)** Do ratings given and reviews given to an app during open beta appear to everyone when you go live?  
**Q2)** Are ratings country specific?  I seem to find conflicting opinions on this. Will a user in Italy see the same rating and reviews as someone in the UK?  
**Q3)** Slightly trickier to answer perhaps - If I don't release in different countries, people complain that my game isn't available to them and that they would be happy with just an English language version (I had complaints to this effect even pre-Alpha). If I do release in different countries people will rate it badly because the app is not in their language. What - in your opinion - is the best way to go?  


Thanks!
