This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I've been trying to integrate more ad networks in my mediation chain and looked at AppLovin, for which the minimum payout for PayPal is $20 and the payout period is NET 30 (I think, because they don't mention the exact payout dates if you don't have an account, all the above info is gathered from various sources).

So how is/was your experience with them? What eCPM do you get for Interstitials/Banners/Rewarded Vids? Is the above info about payout correct? What's the Fill rate you got? Is it worth adding?

How do we create a carousel effect for a horizontal recycler view where each item is snapped to the center of the screen (and the size of the snapped view increases) while scrolling along?

I see that on Android Studio SDK Emulators, there are many API levels and ABI versions.

&amp;#x200B;

My app supports only arm64-v8a and armabi-7a. I want to support newer version like Pie and OREO but I can only find x86 and x86\_64 ABI versions.

&amp;#x200B;

Does that mean I can't support these versions like Orea etc?

I have implemented rewarded video ads on my app.

&amp;#x200B;

I also set up a mediation with AppLovin.

&amp;#x200B;

However, now it seems most of my ads served are from AppLovin.

I do not want this because applovin ads does not show the "X" close button and indicator of duration of video.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to use Google Admob as main source of ads, and use only applovin if they can't fulfil an ad request

&amp;#x200B;

How do I do this?
## [12][Can BOM (bill of materials) be used in Gradle build script classpath dependencies?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fswn2b/can_bom_bill_of_materials_be_used_in_gradle_build/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/fswn2b/can_bom_bill_of_materials_be_used_in_gradle_build/
---
Asking because Firebase BOM includes version for Gradle plugin `com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.0.0-beta03`, which is added to classpath of top-level build script. BOM usage example only tells to add BOM to module's build.gradle via `implementation platform`.

So the question is, can the version from BOM be propagated to buildscript classpath? I tried adding BOM line to classpath to no avail.
