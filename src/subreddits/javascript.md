So I've been debating whether I should be implementing hooks more since their inception, and recently at my place of employment, I realized that I lean heavily towards using Redux vs Hooks + Context for a couple major reasons. One is the age of Redux and things like the dev tools which make it super simple to debug (I've had to spin up my own logger and diff checker for my reducer hooks), but the other large reason I haven't seen anyone mention is that hooks tie you into React and React alone.

If eventually you need to move your code base over to another framework/library, you can't transfer the application state with you as easily. Because Redux is framework agnostic, you can always just hook into it from your new framework/library of choice.

I've recently had to deal with this at my company with migrating from Angular 1 to React, with all of the state logic being in Angular 1. We're now putting the logic into Redux so that in the future, if we ever have to migrate again, our state logic stays solid and makes the migration that much easier.

With all this being said, I'm starting at a new company in a month where they are much more hooks heavy, so I'm excited to see how they do things and learn their approaches :)

Thoughts?
