Since one or two weeks some ads inside my app wont show up and would just flicker! Its random when this happens, and it flickers continuously

I have banner ads and video ads in my app and thats the way i call them:

    holder.wv.setInitialScale(1); holder.wv.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null); //i call that on banner ads, stackoverflow fix 
    holder.wv.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true); 
    holder.wv.setBackgroundColor(Color.argb(1, 0, 0, 0)); //stackoverflow fix 
    holder.wv.getSettings().setUseWideViewPort(true); 
    holder.wv.getSettings().setLoadWithOverviewMode(true); 
    holder.wv.setScrollBarStyle(WebView.SCROLLBARS_OUTSIDE_OVERLAY); 
    holder.wv.setScrollbarFadingEnabled(false); //loadurl etc
    

I already googled a lot and found out that the hardware acceleration might be problem so I am turning it off for the banner ads but for my video ads i cant because otherwise they wouldnt work

My ads are integrated in a Recyclerview that loads a CardView with the Webview inside. I have 4-5 on each site but there were no problems with the amount of ads, never. There must be kind of issue with the Webview or the Chrome Driver itself? Thats what came up when I searched for my problem

Does anyone encountered this problem?

## [6][Any issues with Android Studio/native NDK development workflows if one updates to MacOS Catalina (which only allows 64-bit code to run)](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i28t4b/any_issues_with_android_studionative_ndk/)

MacOS Catalina is the first mac os version that is going to stop supporting 32-bit code - only 64-bit programs/libraries
will run.

My question is whether any of the android developer (Android Studio/NDK compilation) workflows are going to be affected by this ?

Are there any components there that are still 32-bit and may fail on MacOS Catalina?

When we considered user auth methods, we first looked at using only using "Sign in with Google/Facebook". However, App Store guidelines now require that any "app that use a social login service ... must also offer Sign in With Apple as an equivalent option" -- which means you won't be given the true email of most users (given [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425)) ... **so if you're developing X-Platform, simply using Google &amp; Facebook is no longer viable.**

Given we wanted to allow users to find other users on the app, we needed a unique user identifier per user, giving us 4 options:

1. **Email + Password** ... requires forgot password and users to prove email ownership
2. **Support all third-party (Apple, Google, Facebook)** ... and add a new unique identifier to allow friends to find each other, given email will not be sufficient
3. **Phone number magic link** ... we were relying on Expo (previously did not support phone-number auth), and we also felt emails would be a good/cheap tool for communication
4. **Email magic link**

Email magic link felt... perfect, but it was pretty much a disaster, and you should be pretty wary of doing it without implementing safeguards. I imagine email + login code is a better option.

Here are the various safeguards we tried with metrics and graphs: [https://snaphabit.app/blog/password-less-login/](https://snaphabit.app/blog/password-less-login/). Happy to answer any additional questions!

## [10][ViewSwapper: a new library for single activity architecture fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i26z7v/viewswapper_a_new_library_for_single_activity/)

Self plugging here for a recent library I made:

ViewSwapper is a simple view container (think like FrameLayout) that supports transitions (API level 19+) and can be used to swap out screens without having to bother with fragments: [https://github.com/grant-park/ViewSwapper](https://github.com/grant-park/ViewSwapper)

it's meant to be a convenient basis for UI in any MVU/MVI apps, but also great for anyone who needs some flexible and lightweight view replacement

would love to start some discussion and answer any questions regarding this or single activity

Just something that's been on my mind for some time. I'm sure I'm not the first one.

I've been doing Android development for nearly 5 years now, currently working as platform lead. I actually still like the platform (although it's not perfect) and write code regularly but was thinking about broadening my skill set.

Anybody here who's gone through this? And if you switched to a BE job, do you prefer it now?
