**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

So I've been programming in C++ using Mingw for about a year, and I still don't understand the linking process when using libraries.

\- What is .dll/.a/.o etc. file I'm getting a bit confused.

\- Should I  put the files in the mingw library files, or should I keep them in my project folder? (Advantages/Disadvantages)

\- Consider that I have a compiled library file for glfw and glew. How should I know which extra libraries are needed?

Inspired by a few posts about promoting how/where to learn modern C++, I also took some time to read one of my favorite books "Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers again, and write some notes, a small reference sheet of sorts.

I've tried to keep it brief, and it will come in handy for a quick revision of (some of the many) important points made in the book; needless to say one should still read the whole book!

Here is the link: [https://github.com/muqsitnawaz/modern-cpp-cheatsheet](https://github.com/muqsitnawaz/modern-cpp-cheatsheet) 

I've proof-read the notes, but if something seems fishy, do let me know. Thanks!

## [10][Using custom deleters with shared_ptr and unique_ptr](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gtco2v/using_custom_deleters_with_shared_ptr_and_unique/)

[https://link.medium.com/0xVVPtq0T6](https://link.medium.com/0xVVPtq0T6)

Have compiled an article on using custom deleters that covers the following things -

1. Why someone might need to specify a custom deleter and how it may be helpful in a few cases?
2. How to use custom deleter with `unique_ptr`? (and what is std::default\_delete ?)
3. How to use custom deleter with `shared_ptr`?
4. In how many ways we can specify these custom deleters?(`std::function` vs stateless  lambda / functor, stateful lambda / functor, function pointer etc)
5. What's the cost for each of these deleter type with `shared_ptr`
6. What's the cost for each of these deleter type with `unique_ptr`
7. Restrictions that come with the usage of custom deleters.

Would love to improve the article based on your suggestions and insights.
