I first started learning React back in 2016, this was the time when React had 2 APIs, the well-known Classes API, and the previous Object? API.

I believe I am fairly competent in writing React applications, as I have worked on a Full-Stack application at my workplace. I don't use Express, but rather Golang.

In the middle of 2016, my company switched over to WordPress/PHP along with jQuery, no chance of React, and that job ended last week.

I do currently know:

* Hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer)
* React Router 3
* Redux
* Webpack

I feel that since I have not worked with React in any significant capacity since 2016, I am not competitive. I feel overwhelmed at just how different the front-end ecosystem is these and I have no idea what I should learn to get myself up to speed.

const request = await axios.get(fetchUrl);  
console.log(request);  
return request;  
}  
fetchData();  
},\[\]);

Hi!  


I am a React Native developer and I am very interested in learning more about animations since our clients are very much into it. I started using spring but I believe I need to know more in order to do more and so I'm asking you, who do you think has the best React animations/spring course out there? I found  Start React Native ( by William  Candillon) but he is pricey and I would like to know if it's worth investing in his courses? Thank you

Hi all,

I'm looking for a React DataGrid component, ideally open source, to tick the following requirements:

* fully documented
* used in production by Enterprise users
* developed on react ground up - not a wrapper like ag-grid
* have multi-level grouping

Cheers

I started learning React for a side project a year ago, and so far I love creating user interfaces with this library! But recently, as a junior developer, I was hired to work on a multi-solution platform including an Angular web project. 

I already have the web requirements to make fast progress but a lot of things vary between React and Angular. Right now, despite getting a full-time job based on an Angular project, I'm still working on a React side project. Have you experienced multiple javascript frontend frameworks/libraries in your webdev journey ?
