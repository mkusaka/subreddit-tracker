I have two separate div. Each div contains one or multiple items. The width of the item is calculated from the duration of item i.e. width = (durationInSecond \* 1.0) / 15) \* 130. So my main concern is if I add two items each of duration 15 in DIV1 and another item of duration 30 in DIV2, I expect the item in DIV2 to be aligned with the end of the second item of DIV1. But in this case, it doesn't appear so. That's because of the space between the two items in the DIV1. I need the space between the two items as they are resizable and my cursor shows a resize icon while hovering the item. So if I eliminate the space between the item, there would be confusion while resizing the item. Any suggestions on how to get the expected output?
