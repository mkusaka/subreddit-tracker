Hi everyone!

This is my first post here. I want to share the portfolio I created using Gatsby, with some flourishing using my genetic algorithm library, Genie.js (source [here](https://github.com/adrianmarkperea/genie), and demo [here](https://genie-phrase-guesser.netlify.app/)).

You can check it out at the following link: [https://adrianperea.dev](https://adrianperea.dev)

I never really fancied myself as a web developer, but proud that I made it this far. Didn't realize beforehand that CSS would've taken most of my time.

Hope to hear what you guys think!

Cheers.
## [5][Is there a better way to use Sass and Css modules together in React?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h8twrc/is_there_a_better_way_to_use_sass_and_css_modules/)

Hello. I apologize if this is trivial, but wanted to get your opinions on how I‚Äôm going about this. Some context: I started at a new company in January. I‚Äôm the only dev working on the UI. I inherited a repo that was pretty unwieldy and I was brought on with no prior knowledge to react. For the past six months, I‚Äôve gotten the hang of React for the most part. After months of Udemy tutorials and on-the-job experience, I‚Äôve learned quite a lot (still got a ways to go). I‚Äôve realized that our repo closely resembles the Maximillian Academind React Udemy course. It‚Äôs a great course, and I recommend it for beginners, but the repo structure is a bit dated (mostly class based components). That‚Äôs fine for now. The repo is small enough that I will eventually adopt hooks (doing tutorials on hooks currently) and context api. Ok here we go. When I joined the team, the UI repo had Css modules in place. This was the import statement:

import classes from ‚Äò./Component.module.css‚Äô;

And to bring in the Css classes, the repo would use classes.NameofCssClass in the jsx. This is how it was done in the Maximilian course as well. Pretty cumbersome. Fast forward to now. I use ‚Äòcss‚Äô variable name instead of ‚Äòclasses‚Äô and i now use Sass. I‚Äôve been using it alongside Css modules. I like Css modules for avoiding name space collisions, but it‚Äôs not great for the BEM naming convention. For instance, I can‚Äôt use classes.block-element‚Äîmodifier. Because I like BEM, I‚Äôve been using the following approach:

import css from ‚Äò./Component.module.scss‚Äô;

//example jsx
&lt;div className={css[‚Äòblock-element‚Äô]}&gt;stuff&lt;/div&gt;

So my question: is there a better way? This seems pretty clunky as well but I really can‚Äôt think of a better way to use css modules, Sass, and BEM together. Please excuse my noobness. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
## [6][How big is the jump from React to React Native?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h8tmsj/how_big_is_the_jump_from_react_to_react_native/)

Forgive me if this is a naive question: 

I'm beginning to get into React.js (ie I do not have much experience at all with it as yet, but am very excited to get into it) and have a very keen interest in mobile development as well. Up until this point I've been dabbling in flutter as a mobile development framework, which I have found to be a really great experience - however, I am very attracted to the idea of being able to use similar code/techniques/technologies on multiple fronts, if that makes sense - which is why I'm considering the similarities between React and React Native. 

If I get proficient in React.js, will there be a big jump to then get into React Native, or are they very similar?

Hey guys,

I've just finished my portfolio site using next.js and tailwind.css. It's been fun building and I think that using `getStaticPaths` in next can get you really far.

Anyways here's my site: lenardpratt.com 

It should be fully mobile responsive but if theirs any bugs let me know. Any design tips would also be appreciated.

Thanks

Hello everyone!

I have recently finished my portfolio website designed with React and Redux. I want to share it here and get your comments and feedback.

You can see the site here: [www.rahuleswar.com](https://www.rahuleswar.com)

And source is at this repo:  [https://github.com/esyywar/rahul-portfolio](https://github.com/esyywar/rahul-portfolio)

I have focused on mobile platforms and this is my first project done with mobile-first design. It is a no-scrolling static website.... I have had to touch up the cross platform responsiveness a lot over past couple days... If anyone finds it looks weird on their device, I will appreciate if you let me know!

I have implemented features like the the typewriting animation and swipe events without use of any packages. I did use React Transitions Group for the page change animations. I also used a little bit of MDB React Bootstrap for some buttons.

I would be happy to hear any comments and feedback you can give about the website and/or the code! I have never had any of my react project code reviewed in the past and am curious if I am following the correct practices.

Thanks in advance :)

So I've made a portfolio for a photographer and now that it has been a while the google crawler has done its job.

However, the top search result for the person isn't what I want, the second result is the right one.

Let me show you what I get as top: [https://i.imgur.com/YJxLbMX.png](https://i.imgur.com/YJxLbMX.png)

Anyone has a clue why this has happened? I'm clueless and I have no idea how to fix it! I'm a bit stressed out because this makes it look very unprofessional.
## [11][building production ready boilerplate for my company as a junior developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h8r6ge/building_production_ready_boilerplate_for_my/)

Hello guys,

I am working in a startup and we decided to start our new project with React. We are currently using jQuery for other big product. This new product will be a large scale dashboard.

\-It will be user login private dashboard. So no need for SEO.

\-It will make lots of interactions with backend. Lots of data in and out.

\-It will depend on interactive map.

\-It will have at least 10 pages with nested routes.

\-It will use theme based on user.

\-It will be multilanguage and need datepicker.

I decided to go with **Create React App** as a starter kit. I am currently in the research and I am trying my best to decide the dependencies in a right way for the project. I have no experience in React project in work life I only made projects for my own side projects. I really need you help since there is no senior frontend developer in my company. All burden is at my shoulders.

If you just look at what I decided so far and tell me if I chose wrong or there is better, or I did not include dependency that is important, please let me know.

**State Management** \-Redux, Redux Toolkit, Redux Saga, Selector

**Router** \-React Router, connected react router

**Language** \-React-i18next, Babeledit

**Map -** React-Leaflet

**Datepicker -** React-datepicker

**Css -** Styled Components

**Icons**

[https://medium.com/@david.gilbertson/icons-as-react-components-de3e33cb8792](https://medium.com/@david.gilbertson/icons-as-react-components-de3e33cb8792)

**Project structure**

&amp;#x200B;

I will update the post and let you know what I decided and will be used in production.
## [12][I was today years old when I learnt we can have multiple 'useState' hooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h8oj3j/i_was_today_years_old_when_i_learnt_we_can_have/)

I have been using state as:

`const [state, setState] = useState({loading: false, error: false, data: null})`

I use spread operator to mutate the state and contextAPI for statedrilling.

 I read [React State Management in 2020](https://medium.com/better-programming/react-state-management-in-2020-719d10c816bf) by Tom Buyse and he shared how state hooks help in maintaining state.

Tom used state as the following in the component:

    const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(false);   
    const [hasError, setError] = useState(false);   
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);

Do you all think this is more efficient way and does this scale at an enterprise-scale? Eg. if I am building an eCommerce website that has Springboot as backend, can I remove Redux/MobX to remove state management?
