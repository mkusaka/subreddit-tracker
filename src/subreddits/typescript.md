## [2][Must I always extend protected members to be protected?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h9g59c/must_i_always_extend_protected_members_to_be/)

I have something like this:

    abstract class Base {
        protected description: string = ``;
    }
    
    class Subclass extends Base {
        private description: string = ``;
    
    }
    
    /* class Subclass
    Class 'Subclass' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
      Property 'description' is private in type 'Subclass' but not in type 'Base'.ts(2415) */

I don't plan to extend `Subclass` so I thought marking `description` as `protected` would not be necessary or very clear to others. I therefore thought `description` in `Subclass` should be marked `private`, but only the `protected` keyword avoids errors.

Can anyone help me understand why `protected` is needed here?

Is the case simply that any time you extend a class you must identify overwritten members with the `protected` keyword?

Hi.  If I have a file, `Foo.tx` which defines `interface IFoo` and an export default class `export default class Foo implements IFoo`; when should I `export { IFoo }`.

Are there any advantages to exporting the interface too?

---

**Edit: explanation**

I have a bunch of TypeScript files which are for a module.  Will exporting interfaces help with IntelliSense?  Will not exporting interfaces for the module (though I am exporting classes) strip away something helpful from those using the node module I am making?

Hi.  I have a TypeScript project which I want to put out as npm module.

Currently the TypeScript source code is in `src` directory.
```
src
| - Foo
       | - Foo.ts  // -&gt; export default class Foo
| - Bar
        | - Bar.ts  // -&gt; export default class Bar
| - index.ts // -&gt; export { Foo, Bar }
```
With the current `tsconfig.json`, types are emitted in the `types` directory, and compiled JavaScript code is in `dist`.

But when I create a `main.js` file which imports `Foo` from `dist/index`; IntelliSense does not suggest any methods I had defined for `Foo`.  How do I make it work?

Using vscode.

A component have many props, eg. - `props.navigation`, `props.showMenu`, etc. But typescript is giving me error saying `navigation does not exist in Object` and squiggly red underlines `navigation`. I can resolve this by clicking Quick Fix and then declare property 'navigation'. This adds navigation in the Object interface.

Do I really have to do this for every property inside props?

So I will try to explain my issue:  


"account" is an object containing the usual stuff like name/password/etc..

In my updateAccount function I have a parameter "data" which can contain the Id and whatever fields needs updating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here arises my struggle with typescript, in normal javascript I would simply do:

&amp;#x200B;

Object.keys(data).forEach(key =&gt; {

if(account\[key\]) { this is a valid key to update }

});

This allows me to only update what I need and filter out anything unneeded.  


Yet... typescript seems to be annoyed as hell when you try do this claiming that strings are not a valid child of an account and what not. (the code runs it just gives TS warnings)

Looking into it... it should be fixed by doing:

Object.keys(data).forEach(&lt;T extends keyof AccountModel&gt;(key: T) =&gt; {  


But then it nags about key and value being incompatible... Can anyone shed some light on how you are supposed to do this?

I'm having trouble understanding this odd behavior...

```
interface Foo {
    n? : number;
    s: string;
}

const foo = { n : 1 } as Foo;  // OK

```

If  `s` here isn't optional, then why does this work? Isn't this an error? Shouldn't we be assigning `s` to something?

I'm really stuck on this issue... 

If I have a react components library that I want to isolate I can't just setup a devDependency on @types/react because when I import it  I get a conflict saying that types were found in two locations.  

This is super silly because they're the same types and same version.

I *could* setup peerDependencies, I think, but then I can't have unit tests in the main code or use that as a module by itself.

It ends up causing a LOT of hassle and now I'm basically dead in the water until I completely refactor my  components/modules into separate npm projects.

Is there a workaround here?
