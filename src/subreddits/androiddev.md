This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

On my blog, I previously made a post about the Chaquopy plugin which lets you run Python scripts in an Android app.

This has been one of my most popular posts since it was posted, but I'm just befuddled, why?

I don't see the benefits of using Python over Java / Kotlin (or C++ if you're into that), especially considering the fact that you'll run with compatibility problems when you try to import other Python scripts and libraries.

I'm aware of other Python for Android libraries like PyPi and Kivy, and I don't know how well these can do to make solid Android apps.

Is this a case of Python Developers trying to make use of their existing skills to make Android apps? Or is there something I'm missing?
## [6][AltBeacon - need help with ranging beacons when app in foreground, and also monitoring them when it goes to background.](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i4qlil/altbeacon_need_help_with_ranging_beacons_when_app/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i4qlil/altbeacon_need_help_with_ranging_beacons_when_app/

Hi, I'm asking here hoping that someone has had a similar use case as me and implemented it using [AltBeacon](https://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/).

Firstly, let me explain what exactly I want to achieve.

**When app is opened** on main view, I want to run beacon detection in the foreground, so user can actively see which beacons are detected. I want to **range beacons** here, so I know the proximity as well.

**When app is closed** or in background, I want to run beacon detection again, but I only want to monitor beacons here, so I don't care how far away the user is, just if user enters or exits the beacon range.

**Now here's the problem:**

AltBeacon clearly states that in order to detect beacons in the background, you need to create an instance of \`RegionBootstrap\` that lives through the entire App lifecycle. Sample code is found [here](https://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/samples.html) in "Background" section. 

If \`RegionBootstrap\` is implemented correctly, the app should relaunch the detection service after it's been killed, so it works in the background as well.

My main issue currently is that \`RegionBootstrap\` seems to "override" the beacon detection that's implemented inside the view, using \`BeaconManager.startRangingBeaconsInRegion(region)\`. So the beacon detection works either in the foreground or background, but not both at the same time.

Has anyone implemented something similar yet and how did you solve it? How can I implement beacon ranging when app is opened using \`BeaconManager\`, but also implement background monitoring with \`RegionBootstrap\`?

There didn't seem to be any implementations of the master on/off and individual on/off preference switches as recommended by the Material Design guidelines and making them was pretty time consuming, so I'm releasing it as an open source library.

## [12][ExpandableFab: a customizable, orientation aware Android widget with animations](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/i4a0gk/expandablefab_a_customizable_orientation_aware/)

Just an easy to use library that allows you to beautifully show users the available actions they can take on the current screen.

Orientation Aware meaning you can show different options between portrait and landscape, easily.

Nearly everything is customizable (colors, text, size, placement, margins, animations and more)  and optional (don't need an Overlay, or FabOptions, or Labels, or icons, etc). Every property can be accessed or set through XML layouts or programmatically - whatever you prefer.

Written 100% in Kotlin but comes with full JavaDoc and KDoc (published API is well documented). Also comes with an example app so you can see different use cases with 0 coding.

Let me know what you think.
