We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey guys,

This is probably a silly question, but does anyone know if props drilling creates a deep copy/clone of the js object that you are drilling into the child, or if it just creates a pointer to that object.

Thanks very much
## [5][Anybody tried upgrading react-intl v2 to v3?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fl867m/anybody_tried_upgrading_reactintl_v2_to_v3/)

Hi, this would actually be my first reddit post.  
And I'm also new to react.  
Now, I've already read stackoverflow and a bunch of other resources before posting here for help.  
The rest of the answers in stackoverflow and other sites just points us to the migration guide, but I tried following the guide and still I couldn't figure this out.  
And right now, I really don't know what else to do.

Here's the problem:  
I'm trying to upgrade react-intl v2.9.0 to v3 and up.

My problem is regarding **addLocaleData** since it has been removed starting v3.  
My current project is using this.   
Now, based on [Migration Guide](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/Upgrade-Guide.md#breaking-api-changes), and correct me if I am wrong,   
I should add polyfills only if I'm using IE 11, Safar-12 or Edge right?  


And since the project would be using Chrome, I could just remove addLocaleData without any problems right?

Now the problem is, once I remove addLocaleData my intl object becomes undefined.  
It raises the following errors:  
"Failed context type: The context \`intl\` is marked as required in \`Header\`, but its value is \`undefined\`."  


I've checked other files where intl value could have been changed.  
I've already checked the reducers file too, since it looked like this is the first part where the intl object got declared.  


I'm not sure if I've explained that currently now, but any help would be very appreciated. As I don't know where else to looked. Maybe some of you have already encountered this problem before?

I'm going to have some more time during this outbreak so I thought I could get some React freelance jobs. I would like to have recommendations on where to find, where to look, since I'm not used to freelancing. Thanks in advance.

Why written as "A", the app lost input focus when type in input?

So, I really struggle with finding a good approach in layouting, because I need it for different screen width/orientations, with different sizes of elements (and placements), but it dont see how i could use flexbox or grid for this without doing tons of overhead. I tried to use react-grid-system, but either I am really bad at this or the component is not for me, because while i can create create rows and columns, i cant give the rows vertical space (like assigning the first and the last row 10% on the top and bottom and the "Middle row" stretching) 

I have the feerling that I am thinking wrong, but I'm not sure what i dont know that i dont know about
