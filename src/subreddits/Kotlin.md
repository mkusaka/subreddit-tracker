We’ll be joined by other developers and team leads from Kotlin, as well as two special guests: Wojtek Kaliciński /u/wkalicinski from Google and Sebastien Deleuze /u/sdeleuze from Spring.

On October 12–15 we hosted the Kotlin 1.4 Online Event, and over the course of those four days we received many interesting questions. Since we did not manage to cover all of them due to time constraints, we will answer them in a specific thread under this post.

Please post your questions as top-level comments to this post.

We look forward to hearing from you!

When I use the application plugin and the android plugin in Gradle I get this error:   
`The 'java' plugin has been applied, but it is not compatible with the Android plugins`

Is there a way to easily run the app on the JVM and on android in the same project?

I am sorry if this question is kinda lame.. but i am killing myself last hour or so to figure out what's the issue... In Android Studio Kotlin I want to clean my code based on lint warnings. Cleaned everything except this:

&amp;#x200B;

var myCoolImage = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(myCoolFile.toString())

val hhh = myCoolImage.height

val www = myCoolImage.width

if (hhh &gt; www) myCoolImage = resizeBitmap(myCoolImage,600,400)

else myCoolImage = resizeBitmap(myCoolImage,400,600)

&amp;#x200B;

Simple code to check if photo is horizontal or vertical and to resize it accordingly to that.

This code works but gives warning "assignment should be lifted out of if"

Sooo... Any idea what to do? :)
## [8][Android Kotlin: Click button -&gt; Create ViewText -&gt; Drag ViewText and on drop get Text :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jlpscm/android_kotlin_click_button_create_viewtext_drag/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jlpscm/android_kotlin_click_button_create_viewtext_drag/

EDIT: Ok.. I figured it out.. Dont know what I did.. I was randomly editing code until suddenly started working :)))

Anyhow... I still have problem with No2. Soo.. If anyone can help me with Lint warning. I tried Alt Enter but nothing offered as a solution :)

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ok..sooo... I found some piece of code which does what I want. Create ViewText... Drag it... Drop it..

Now i have 2 problems:

1. After I drop TextView, how to fetch text from it?
2. Lint warning marks "newView.setOnTouchListener(listener)" and tells me: "Custom view TextView has SetOnTouchListener called on it but does not override perform click"

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the Kotlin developers are migrated from the Java environment, coming to Kotlin the collection framework has some tweaks which makes It so awesome to work with, In Today’s article, let's understand how Kotlin catered to Java Maps in his its colors, and few other concepts that will help you understand stdlib of collection

Our specialists at IceRock have contributed to the documentation for the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile portal (https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/). This has been prepared by the JetBrains team, the creators of the Kotlin programming language. The portal helps programmers who study this language independently and use the multi-platform technology.  

Android developers are familiar with Kotlin and understand its benefits – it's capacious, secure, and user-friendly. And iOS app developers can easily learn the syntax because it is similar to Swift.

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (multi-platform) is a set of tools for developing cross-platform apps. It enables business logic to be written just once for two operating systems, Android and iOS. The multi-platform helps reduce the time spent on writing, testing and debugging apps.

We have been using this technology at IceRock for more than 2 years and have released 14 projects based on it. We will talk about this soon in our business cases.
Thanks to their experience in Kotlin development, our specialists have participated in writing documentation for the portal. It contains the following information:

●      multi-platform projects and how to get started with them;

●      the mobile Kotlin multi-platform allowing such projects to be created;

●      what libraries to use and where to find them;

●      the business cases that allow the experience of other development teams to be studied. 

It also provides technical documentation and guides for common problem-solving. 
Several portal sections have been written by our specialists: Vladislav Areshkin @tetraquark_v and Andrey Chernov.
