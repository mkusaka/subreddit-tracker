## [2][Strict null checks . Are they really worth it ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i4q827/strict_null_checks_are_they_really_worth_it/)

Since I enabled strict null check option in tsconfig I have faced some linting errors that make me thing that strict null checks are really not worth it .

For me to satisfy the linter I have to spent more time to make my code less readable by using `as` a lot of times . Sometimes there so many `as` that I have to use , that I even think adding an unnecessary if clause so all the linting will get satisfied without the need of `as` .

But then again I have almost a single day experience with strict null checks .

What is your experience with strict null checks ? Are they more harm than good or the opposite ?

Edit : [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i4q827/strict_null_checks_are_they_really_worth_it/g0jvh1z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) is something that I was missing and will make me not need `as` and `if` .

Title says class, but I mean type.

The context is a model of a navigation dropdown menu where you may have many sub-level items.

The model:

    export type LinksObj = {
        linkText: string;
        linkExternalUrl?: string;
        linkTarget?: string | '_name';
        linkIcon?: string;
        ariaLabel?: string;
        subLinkItems?: LinksObj[];
      }

The possibilities:`LinksObj.subLinkItems.subLinkItems.subLinkItems.subLinkItems.linkText;`

This seems to be working just fine, but should I be doing this? I can't see any issues with it, but it seems odd.

The question in the title .
## [5][Is there such an tsconfig option such as exclude from compiling but not from linting ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i4aisl/is_there_such_an_tsconfig_option_such_as_exclude/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i4aisl/is_there_such_an_tsconfig_option_such_as_exclude/
---
I am asking because I want to lint my test files with the same file that I lint my src files . But I do not want to compile my test files . Exclude option excludes the test files from both linting and compiling .

Should I go for two different tsconfig files ?

How will  I make sure that they have the same compiler options ?

Edit : I am using ts-jest for tests . It automatically compiles the tests file behind the scenes .

## [8][is keyword, versus as](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i3slde/is_keyword_versus_as/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/i3slde/is_keyword_versus_as/
---
Normally I use the `as` keyword to assert a type to help the compiler read the code correctly. Sometimes I also use `as` as a type annotation (for others who read my code including myself).

There is also an `is` keyword. It appears to be another assertion. I have trouble telling what the difference is exactly; can someone clarify the distinction? I don't remember the last time I've used `is`.

I'm making an app with the PokeApi, and I realize that if I want intellisense and type checking for my API responses, i'd have to create a whole massive interface. Do the makers of API's typically have a TS interface for their API, or is there anywhere else that might already? Thanks.
