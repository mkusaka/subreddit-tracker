Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

I just came upon this because I assumed it was a thing.  

Why is it that 

    impl&lt;T,U&gt; From&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt; for Option&lt;U&gt; where U: From&lt;T&gt;

is not implemented.  It seems like a fairly obvious use case to me.  Is there a particular reason they couldn't?

A similar question goes for Result

&gt;Iâ€™m excited to  share that weâ€™re experimenting w porting Relay Compiler into [rustlang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rustlang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rustlang).  Our early results are promising: w a bit of structure itâ€™s easy to pick  up, and we can move fast and ship high quality, efficient  code.

[`crow`](https://crates.io/crates/crow) is a 2D rendering engine based on OpenGL.
I want this crate to be easy to use while still
allowing for nearly everything one might want while using pixel art.

A WIP showcase game can be found on https://github.com/lcnr/akari

Please tell me if there is anything you would want in a 2D game and don't know
how you could implement it using `crow`.
## [7][Wait on spawned child with inherited stdin](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f38hnh/wait_on_spawned_child_with_inherited_stdin/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f38hnh/wait_on_spawned_child_with_inherited_stdin/
---
I've got a wrapper whose sole purpose is to run another arbitrary program, delegate the original stdio to it and wait for it to finish. All's good and easy but Child.wait() specifically closes the inherited stdin. Is there a way not to close stdin, yet wait for the child to exit? The child should exit on stdin EOF or a stdin command.

## [10][GitHub - drbh/hotpot-db: ðŸŒ¶ hottest way to store data on the web. If you like JSON, and dealing with things later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f2vbji/github_drbhhotpotdb_hottest_way_to_store_data_on/)

Hey Rustaceans ðŸ‘‹,

I'd like to share and get feedback on a small crate called hotpot-db! It is essentially an API around SQLite's JSON extension, which allows you to store data in a NoSQL dare I say, DynamoDB like way. 

Any struct that can be Serialized to JSON can be stored and efficiently queried. 

## Flavor Palette

1. schemaless
2. reliable (uses SQLite3)
3. embeddable
4. fast (&lt;200ms to search through +500K objects)
5. JSON store
6. queryable JSON schemas 

## Full Example
```rust
use hotpot_db::*;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), hotpot_db::Error&gt; {
    let mut pot = HotPot::new();

    // lets make a new collection
    pot.create_collection("address_book")?;

    // well make a new item we want to store
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("david holtz"),
        age: 26,
    };

    // we insert the object into the collection!
    pot.insert::&lt;Person&gt;("address_book", &amp;person)?;

    // finally we can query
    let query = QueryBuilder::new()
        .collection("address_book")
        .kind(QueryKind::Object)
        .key("name")
        .comparison("=")
        .string("david holtz")
        .finish();

    let results = pot.execute(query);
    println!("{:#?}", results);

    Ok(())
}
```

[https://github.com/drbh/hotpot-db](https://github.com/drbh/hotpot-db)

This was my first attempt at using the Builder pattern (for queries) and generics (for insert). hotpot-db has already been super helpful for me in the development process where my DB schema is in flux. hotpot-db lets me deal with schemas later and still have solid query performance.


Any feedback on the project/code and idea is greatly appreciated! ðŸ˜Š

Iâ€™m considering Rust for a new project, which requires processing media streams for a wide array of formats. My alternative is C or C++, using FFmpeg. 

Is there an effective/up to date Rust binding for FFmpeg or other crate that people are using for this purpose? Would be great to get a quick overview of the Rust media ecosystem for a Rust noob.

The Rust [mimalloc wrapper](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/mimalloc_rust) crate has just had a new version released!

### Changes

* Updated [mimalloc source](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) to version 1.6.0.

* Removes [libc](https://crates.io/crates/libc) from dependencies, adding support for targets targets which do not depend on it such as wasm.
