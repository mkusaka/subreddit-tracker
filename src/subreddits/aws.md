I rarely use the old console except when I absolutely have to. It was slow and somewhat unappealing to look at. 

AWS just made some major updates to the console and I feel they did so with no user input. At least to me, everything I hate about the old one wasn't addressed or even made worse.

Is this just me or does anyone else feel same?

Most are Debian vms, but we've seen this on a few CentOS vms too.  We didn't do upgrades or change anything else, but they're not booting.  We pay for support, but Amazon hasn't been able to help.  Any ideas on how to fix this issue?

Hi All,

I'm working on a collection of kubectl commands for a better Kubernetes security assessment.

Hello

Is there a way to analyze s3 object usage on time axis? Let's say I want to implement lifecycle to move objects to different storage classes - based on their usage / access.
How can I accomplish this?
Is there a reporting tool that can show object usage based on time?
I read about intelligent tiering but would like to know if there is a reporting tool that shows the usage patterns over time.

I always feel AWS console lack visualization to show the cloud resources and their relationships. This visualization can make using AWS console much more effective. 
Recently came across this solution by AWS.

While it is good to have as a solution, wouldn't it make a better feature in console itself?

Thoughts?

Do we need to set up VPN connectivity to on-premise  prior to execute assessment by the AWS Migration Hub &gt; Discovery tool &gt; Discovery agent ?

My confusion is  without connectivity how AWS will do the assessment and provide recommendation ?

Why I sometimes get insufficient data notification? I should not configure insufficient data action for RDS CPU credit balance, perhaps?

Hello all,
I wanted to work on AWS CloudFormer for creating a template for our environment and I recently found out that Cloud Former is no more available within AWS. 

Can anyone suggest or direct me to a tool or a platform which can replace CloudFormer capabilities.

Thanks

Hey all,

I have a serverless backend and a React.js/Amplify frontend for my application. It allows you to upload a file, which triggers lambda functions for processing the file and saves the new data back to different S3 bucket.

I want to set up push notifications to trigger rendering on the React application when the processed file is available on S3. What is the best approach for this?

Is this what SNS is for? How do I subscribe users on the React app to push notifications - SNS seems to want a server endpoint to  send the notifications to.

I've done push notifications with Pusher and a MERN stack before, but I'm not really sure how to achieve it in a serverless environment.

Thanks!
