This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

I started teaching myself to code about 2-3 years ago and started with Android studio. I could almost get any answer I needed from tutorials or resources.

Since I started I've begun countless projects but only finished a handful. And I've started to realise that it's because I can never make an app look as good as I like. 

Since the quarantine I've started a project I'm really invested in, but I still can't get the UI to look the way I want.
With coding, it's like I know what I want to do and I just need to find out how.
But with UI it's like I don't even know what I want to do.

Does anyone know any good tutorials or learning resources on how to build polished UIs?

sadly, i dont use kotlin professionaly at my job, it's just the way it is. the other day, i just began leetcoding as practice for kotlin, and solved LC-121 Buy and Sell Stocks. my solution was accepted, good, but when i saw the most voted solution, i had mixed feelings. i realized i just wrote a java  code in kotlin. 

kotlin is not just functional programming and idiomatic syntax, it has a idiomatic programming flair to it. just look-up the solution for the aforementioned leetcode problem, and i hope you'll see what i am suggesting here. how do i learn to program idiomatically like that? books? online site? professionally? switch jobs? what happens when in a white-board interview i prefer to code in kotlin, but my solution is more java oriented than idiomatic programming?

So, I somewhat know android development and I've made a couple of apps.

But these have never been published and to be very honest, they are quite messy not following any architecture or guidelines.

So, that brings me here.. I have an app idea which I want to stick to till the end and publish it, and I have some questions..

&amp;#x200B;

1. What architecture should I follow? I heard MVI is good, but I can't find a good resource to learn how to use it, I somewhat know MVVM.
2. What type of layout is best for fitting the most amount of screens, ig constraint layout, but I could be wrong.
3. What is a good website or app to track everything, like features, to-do, etc

I'm developing a simple app that reads an NFC tag and just prints the contents out as a toast, but every time I scan the code I get a pop up for the built-in NFC application on my phone. Is there any way to disable this?

No unit tests, no UI tests, nothing. It seems nobody cares :-(

It also makes it hard to learn more about the subject and I don’t know about you guys but I feel like knowing how to test stuff is what separates you from a median developer.

What can map text to commands..I was looking for any software or service that enables the parts of a system to communicate and manage data. It is the software that handles communication between components and input/output, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

I there:  
Does somebody know where I can purchase a template for Android? (native code).  

  
Personally, I like to develop for Android (practically all my code is adapter/ list horizontal and vertical), but I'm having trouble with the layout (I am not comfy with my layout).  Right now, I am working with Material, that it is a big step ahead of working with vanilla-xml-layout, and it's okay, but I wish to know if there is some more ready-made template.

  
Thanks.

ps: I don't want to hire anybody but I want to hear some recommendations.

What names for models do you prefer in the data, domain, and presentation layers of a project?  


\*Entity  
\*DbModel  
\*NetworkResponse  
\*ApiObject  
\*Domain  
\*Presentation
