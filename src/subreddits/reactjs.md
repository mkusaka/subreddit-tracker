We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi all,
I'm new to React (and Javascript, for that matter). I've followed lots of resources; I'm trying to get global data to populate in this list. I feel like I'm doing something stupidly wrong, but can't really tell what it is.
I would appreciate any tips or feedback anyone might be able to offer.
Also, I don't know what best formatting standards are, I do need to find a styler but I think from what I can tell my code is (mostly) sort of formatted, but if I'm doing anything wrong or should be doing it much better, please let me know.
I hope that it is okay to link to Also sorry there's no syntax highlighting; I tried to use Pastebin, but it thinks I'm a Russian bot out to rig elections and spam, and I'm using a screen reader so I can't solve the spam detection; there is no audio.
Thanks in advance for any tips!

I am currently testing out my React knowledge by building a simple file upload React front-end project.

Now I want to show file operations to the end user based on the following activities happening on the Front-end.

File Operations

1. File Upload Started
2. File Upload Complete
3. File Convert Started
4. File Convert Complete
5. Error Status

Now the problem is that I'm confused about how to structure my App state based on the operations above. I don't know if I should use `useState` or `useReducer`

Below is what I currently came up with but feel it makes the App State too much bloated because if I begin passing each state as props to other components that might need them, this will make the app too bloated.


`/*Value of fileUploadStatus will be either the string null or start or done*/`

`const [fileUploadStatus, setFileUploadStatus] = useState(null);` 

`/*Value of fileConvertStatus will be either the string null or start or done*/`

`const [fileConvertStatus, setFileConvertStatus] = useState(null); `

`const [errorStatus, setErrorStatus] = useState({`
	`errorOccured: false,`
	`errorMessage: null`
	`}); `

I just need opinions on how you would structure your data based on the above file operations. Suggestions are also welcomed

Thanks

My app consists of a form with a username input and a password input box, after pressing the button to submit, I send a fetch request to my server that is built with express js.

Is there a way to safely send the username and password from the client-side?

# Does it exist a component that does this?

React popup box on antd form input showing operator such as &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= etc to add to the input

It can look like something like this - **Lookup-Patterns - Certain Category** :

[https://ant.design/components/auto-complete/](https://ant.design/components/auto-complete/)

However, it should add the chosen row in dropdown to the input instead.

Does anyone know a recommendation?
