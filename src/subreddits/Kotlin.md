I have been using Java/Spring for web development for years.

I recently have started learning Kotlin. I want to explore more and use/try different web development framework with Kotlin.

I know Spring  has a good support for Kotlin but I want to learn new framework that I can use in Production if chance permits.

Any suggestion between Ktor, Vertx or Micronaut and why?

I'm stumped on how I can make a textview display a certain string based on an outcome. For instance, if a dice rolled a 4, then the textview changes to "You rolled a 4!". I feel like the answer is something I should definitely know but I'm having a brainfart. Please point me in the right direction.
## [5][How can I initialize a variable within a listener and keep it's data outside the listener?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hsdfgv/how_can_i_initialize_a_variable_within_a_listener/)

I have a simple OnDateSetListener for a calender, and within the listener I set a var called "birthdate" to the inputted date. I then want to use that date outside of the listener, but I can't find anything that explains it. I tried creating the var outside the listener rather than inside like so:

    var birthDate : Date

and then initializing it on the inside of the listener:

    birthDate = birth

but then my println outside the listener still says its not initialized. How can I keep the data even outside the listener?

Hi guys,

We have made Open Source Tool for the Programmers - Nexss Programmer. 

50 different programming languages together... 

Kotlin is included so you can combine it with other languages!

If you guys want to check it out here is the link for the video presentation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WbnYyEnBNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WbnYyEnBNk)

It would be great if we can get more feedback on it.

Have a nice day!
## [7][Should I first learn Kotlin/Native (multiplatform) or Swift?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hs8e2d/should_i_first_learn_kotlinnative_multiplatform/)

I've done a lot of research, and Kotlin/Native and JVM finally seems like the answer to the endless quest for the best "write once, run anywhere" toolset.

I have very minimal programming experience, but I refuse to start with Python first for a few reasons. I'd eventually like to be able to have high-performance iOS and Android apps, macOS, Linux, and Windows apps using TornadoFX (or Kotlin/Native?), and run on the web via WebAssembly.

My problems are:

* I'll end up having to learn multiple languages (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, maybe Go) if I don't choose Kotlin Multiplatform, though I feel like this will happen anyway since I'm working with multiple SDKs and frameworks
* I don't have access to an Android device (Apple-based household), so physically running Android apps isn't viable and I'm not familiar with Google's ecosystem (don't want to be, but I have to be)
* Unlike Swift, there aren't a ton of resources to learn Kotlin, though I do own the continuously updated Atomic Kotlin book/Stepik course
* Multiplatform projects are still experimental, but I doubt I'll have a professional app ready before it's considered stable. I'm afraid a lot will change and break, making a more stable solution better for learning and getting things up and running
* I've heard Xcode is garbage compared to IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio

Coming from the dotnet world and using dapper to map to a class, wondering if there's a way to use the speed of jasync-sql along with either a supporting library or by itself to do something like:

     val future = con.sendPreparedStatement(query, values)
     val result = future.get&lt;MyDataClass&gt;()

Is there an easy way to map to a data class - or should I be looking into jdbi, jooq, exposed, or something else entirely instead?
