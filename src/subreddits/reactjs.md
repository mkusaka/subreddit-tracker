I want to move away from storing my JWTs in local storage since itâ€™s vulnerable to XSS attacks. So I was thinking of storing a refresh token in a cookie, and the session cookie just in memory. 

So cookies are vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Is setting the cookie to httpOnly, sameSite, and secure enough to prevent this? Or is there more I have to do? I have been trying to research this but Iâ€™m getting conflicting results.

Hi Everyone,

I'm new to the React world (formally used React Native), and I've been looking around at open source examples. Most of the open source examples out there are barely implemented starter templates or components.

Does anyone have any recommendations for full open source websites implemented in React JS? I'd just really like to see how things are organized and the correct way of doing this.

Thanks!

Can't you just use React Router? Why would you want to have multiple microfrontends in a CRUD application? What are the pros and cons?

Hello, Guys. I'm wondering whether NextJS is good enough for a big project like Reddit or Wikipedia or Medium? If not, What are the good alternatives? Our backend is using NodeJS and DynamoDB

Thank you.

I'm new to this kind of problem. I'm trying to create a project which will have multiple internal "Modules". By default some modules will be free but I would like to know, how would someone design a structure that allows users to pay a fee to be able to use the extra modules.

It's something like upgrading to a "Pro account" but instead of a binary thing, It only enables the module that the user has paid for.

Also, how would you bundle the app (Electron JS + React in this case)?  Deliver all the code to the all the users or is there any other way to do this. 

I would appreciate any kind of help/guidance to the correct path, literature or resources. 

Thanks in advance.
## [11][use-dispose: React hook for disposing uncommitted logic](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jk9p7t/usedispose_react_hook_for_disposing_uncommitted/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jk9p7t/usedispose_react_hook_for_disposing_uncommitted/

Hello everyone!

I created this simple hook that performs an asynchronous cleanup for uncommitted logic on React components.

Recently, I just found out that components renders twice on Strict Mode, Blocking Mode and Concurrent Mode before it even gets the chance to commit the changes and run the side-effects, which could lead into unwanted memory leaks such as creating WebWorkers, instanciating WebSocket clients, etc., which occurs often on third-party code that React cannot manage.

`use-dispose` comes into play by guaranteeing that the created, uncommitted object can be disposed during the render phases. The package also includes a hook called `useDisposableMemo` which manages a disposable object automatically throughout the component's lifecycle.

Links:

- NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dispose

- Github: https://github.com/LXSMNSYC/use-dispose

Special thanks to Paul Henschel whom I helped and talked to on solving invalidated memoized objects, and to Daishi Kato who originally came up with a cleanup hook.
