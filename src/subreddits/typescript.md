The monthly thread for people to post openings at their companies.

* Please state the job location and include the keywords REMOTE, INTERNS and/or VISA when the corresponding sort of candidate is welcome. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.

* Please only post if you personally are part of the hiring company—no recruiting firms or job boards **Please report recruiters or job boards**. 

* Only one post per company. 

* If it isn't a household name, explain what your company does. Sell it.

* Please add the company email that applications should be sent to, or the companies application web form/job posting (needless to say this should be on the company website, not a third party site).


Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.

Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in the job. 

Posting top level comments that aren't job postings, [that's a paddlin](https://i.imgur.com/FxMKfnY.jpg)

## [3][Combine multiple basic types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fscok7/combine_multiple_basic_types/)

Hello everyone,

let's say I have the following string:

&gt;'133962:22:last'

The colons are used as separators. The first two parts are always only digits, the last one is a known string value.

Now I'd like to define this as its own type, preferably by combining multiple subtypes, e.g. (pseudocode)

&gt;type knownString = 'first' | 'second' | 'last' 

&gt;type groupedType = number &amp; ':' &amp; number &amp; ':' &amp; knownString

is something like this at all possible?

Thanks!

Hey guys, I have to create an typescript app. I got 2 months for this. I can use frameworks but I would prefer typescript base project. 
I thought about it a lot of but my ideas were nothing special. That's why I came here.
Thanks for all answers
## [9][Exporting Packages](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/frlugf/exporting_packages/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/frlugf/exporting_packages/
---
Hello! I am exporting a package I have created with common types and interfaces between my backend and frontend.

What I am trying to achieve is the ability to import from the package like so:

`import { something } from @quwackers/common/utils/stuff`

Currently I am building to *dist/* however this means I can not access the above, i.e.

`dist/`  
`├── types/`  
`├── common/`  
`└── utils/`

I determined I could build simply to the root and import as indicated above, but I want to know if there is a '*cleaner'* or *'better'* generally accepted way to export my package.

I don't understand how one can overlook the need for standard library reference documentation.
