First off, I apologize if this has been asked 100 times before.  I searched and found lots of questions, but none that seemed exactly in my sweet spot.

I am a experienced web developer (mostly React on the front end &amp; node/rails on the backend) and am an aws solutions architect who has had almost zero exposure to mobile other than PWAs and playing with React Native.  I have a couple ideas that I'd like to try to build and figured it would be a good chance to dip my toes in the mobile waters.

I'd love any advice on resources/books/courses/videos to get me started as someone who doesn't need an intro to programming and OO &amp; functional techniqures, but does need an intro to mobile and Kotlin.  Also, as an aside, I have ZERO java experience, and I am wondering if Kotlin is the way to go, or am I going to need to learn java at some point anyway?

Thanks for any and all the help.  I'm in a state of analysis by paralysis in getting started.

I'm learning Kotlin and plan to create an app for android and also a web version. Is it better to stick in Kotlin (then transpile to JS) for the web version or just program my web version in JS?

I want to try Tornadofx with Kotlin. But I haven't found any step by step tutorial. Seems like Kotlin is still a new language :/

If anyone can help me with Tornadofx then it will be very helpful !!

1) Is it anyone who using ktor in production, and what is your opinion?
2) How to persuade the management(CTO, team leads) to start using Ktor?
