We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I came across [a guide](https://medium.com/@ItsMeDannyZ/react-hooks-slider-how-to-build-an-image-slider-with-autoplay-part-2-c94deaf763c4) that makes use of useRef alongside useEffect (section "useRef and useEffect Hooks" in the previous link), and I have a hard time understanding exactly how that works. 

Thus I went looking for articles talking about useRef in depth, but everything I found has been about useRef as a tool for manipulating the DOM directly, which I guess is their primary use.

I have two questions : 

* Every article I read so far kept saying we shouldn't use refs except when there was no other choice. Is the practice shown in the previous link recommended? 
* Does anybody know of an in-depth article about that particular pattern of useRef alongside useEffect, and not to manipulate the DOM?
