The way web applications are created has changed since the creation of React.

By operating on a virtual DOM instead of the real one, it makes updating UI extremely fast and manageable.

It seems that all tools are set up from the beginning, so how is it possible that React apps still have poor performance and delays?

Actually, the way people use the library is no less important.

Im currently making a full stack application and its a blog type website that has a post and comments. 

Basically I want to tell the user when was the comment added. Like added just now, added two hours ago, added yesterday and so on.

And also i want to update it. Lets say you commented on a post and it says ‚Äúadded just now‚Äù, and lets say 5mins has passed without the user refreshing the page I would want to to update and say ‚Äúadded a few mins ago‚Äù or so. 

Thank you!
## [8][How to secure a Client Secret ID with create-react-app hosted on Netlify](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jh8sg7/how_to_secure_a_client_secret_id_with/)

Hello,

I have limited web dev experience. I built a create-react-app, which essentially pulls back data from [http://strava.com](http://strava.com/). Part of the authorization process of getting data from strava is passing a Client Secret ID; something I want to keep secure.

I have a .env file where I store this Client Secret ID value i.e. REACT\_APP\_CLIENT\_SECRET=1234567890 and my .env file resides in .gitignore so it is not exposed my Git Repo.

My app is hosted on Netlify where I then stored the Client Secret ID in a Netlify environment variable under Build and Deploy settings.

I set up a Lambda function to handle the Axios call that passes the Client Secret ID to strava (intended to make the call on the server thus securing my client secret). This all works great.

What I didn‚Äôt expect however was that the Client Secret ID is still accessible in source source through the client. 

I've since discovered that no environment variables can be accessed from create-react-app dynamically from the browser when hosted on Netlify since they must be accessed at build time to be used in the static site. Hence why they are bundled into the client source code.

So I am unsure of how to handle this. What are options for keeping this Client Secret ID secure?

Thanks in advance, I hope I have explained this properly.

I'm building an app that needs a dual range slider &amp; an image caroussel. Some npm librairies are perfect to achieve great results in a short amount of time (rc-slider &amp; react-slick for example), but their combined weight is almost 1mb, which is huge.

If I use Terser plugin in my webpack config, will all the module's weight will have to be downloaded by the user? If I add images, scripts &amp; co on top of this, a page would weight 3 to 4mb, which is pure folly.

Hi all, I'm working on freemeals.uk, part of the campaign by Marcus Rashford to get UK schoolchildren free meals over the UK half term, who might otherwise go hungry. I've been doing this since 11am yesterday and now really need some support. If you're a React or JS developer and have some time today to help, please let me know! You don't necessarily have to be from the UK, btw.

The github repo is [here](https://github.com/tomoakley/freemeals.uk) - please don't judge the code! The great Andy Clarke, [@malarkey](https://twitter.com/malarkey) on Twitter, is [working on the design](https://twitter.com/Malarkey/status/1319969646188122112) right now. I'm currently working on geolocating the user to provide more relevant results. 

Thanks!

Hi! I'm a software developer where I mainly use Java/Kotlin. Although I have a job, It is not enough because it is my first job and I have a low salary (Philippines). I'm now thinking of doing freelancing. I know a lot about React, Node/Express, MongoDB/SQL, basically MERN Stack, but is it enough for freelancing? 

I really don't know where to start and I saw a thread where they said React sucks for freelancing due to SEO. I'm thinking of learning Gatsby/Next but it might take me some time to learn because I have a 9-5 job weekdays.

Thanks for listening.
