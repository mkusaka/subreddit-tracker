I've been a Java/C#/Python dev for a number of years. I noticed Rust topping the StackOverflow most loved language list earlier this year, and I've been hearing good things about Rust's memory model and \"free\" concurrency for awhile. When it recently came time to rewrite one of my projects as a small webservice, it seemed like the perfect time to learn Rust.\n\nI've been at this for about a month and so far I'm not understanding the love at all. I haven't spent this much time fighting a language in awhile. I'll keep the frustration to myself, but I do have a number of critiques I wouldn't mind discussing. Perhaps my perspective as a beginner will be helpful to someone. Hopefully someone else has faced some of the same issues and can explain why the language is still worthwhile.\n\nFwiw - I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to the languages I'm comfortable with. I'm not attempting to make a value comparison of the languages themselves, but simply comparing workflows I like with workflows I find frustrating or counterintuitive.\n\n**Docs**\n\nWhen I have a question about a language feature in C# or Python, I go look at the official language documentation. Python in particular does a really nice job of breaking down what a class is designed to do and how to do it. Rust's standard docs are little more than Javadocs with extremely minimal examples. There are more examples in the Rust Book, but these too are super simplified. Anything more significant requires research on third-party sites like StackOverflow, and Rust is too new to have a lot of content there yet.\n\nIt took me a week and a half of fighting the borrow checker to realize that `HashMap.get_mut()` was not the correct way to get and modify a map entry whose value was a non-primitive object. Nothing in the official docs suggested this, and I was actually on the verge of quitting the langugage over this until someone linked [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/00_en.html), which did have a useful map example, in a Reddit comment. (If any other poor soul stumbles across this - you need `HashMap.entry().or_insert()`, and you modify the resulting entry in place using `*my_entry.value = whatever`. The borrow checker doesn't allow getting the entry, modifying it, and putting it back in the map.)\n\n**Pit of Success/Failure**\n\nC# has the concept of a [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/): the most natural thing to do should be the correct thing to do. It should be easy to succeed and hard to fail.\n\nRust takes the opposite approach: every natural thing to do is a landmine. `Option.unwrap()` can and will terminate my program. `String.len()` sets me up for a crash when I try to do character processing because what I actually want is `String.chars.count()`. `HashMap.get_mut()` is only viable if I know ahead of time that the entry I want is already in the map, because `HashMap.get_mut().unwrap_or()` is a snake pit and simply calling `get_mut()` is apparently enough for the borrow checker to think the map is mutated, so reinserting the map entry afterward causes a borrow error. If-else statements aren't idiomatic. Neither is `return`.\n\n**Language philosophy**\n\nPython has the saying \"we're all adults here.\" Nothing is truly private and devs are expected to be competent enough to know what they should and shouldn't modify. It's possible to monkey patch (overwrite) pretty much anything, including standard functions. The sky's the limit.\nC# has visibility modifiers and the concept of sealing classes to prevent further extension or modification. You can get away with a lot of stuff using inheritance or even extension methods to tack on functionality to existing classes, but if the original dev wanted something to be private, it's (almost) guaranteed to be. (Reflection is still a thing, it's just understood to be dangerous territory a la Python's monkey patching.) This is pretty much \"we're all professionals here\"; I'm trusted to do my job but I'm not trusted with the keys to the nukes.\nRust doesn't let me so much as reference a variable twice in the same method. This is the functional equivalent of being put in a straitjacket because I can't be trusted to not hurt myself. It also means I can't do anything.\n\n**The borrow checker**\n\nThis thing is legendary. I don't understand how it's smart enough to theoretically track data usage across threads, yet dumb enough to complain about variables which are only modified inside a single method. Worse still, it likes to complain about variables which aren't even modified.\n\nHere's a fun example. I do the same assignment twice (in a real-world context, there are operations that don't matter in between.) This is apparently illegal unless Rust can move the value on the right-hand side of the assignment, even though the second assignment is technically a no-op.\n\n\t//let Demo be any struct that doesn't implement Copy.\n    let mut demo_object: Option&lt;Demo&gt; = None;\n    let demo_object_2: Demo = Demo::new(1, 2, 3);\n    \n    demo_object = Some(demo_object_2);\n    demo_object = Some(demo_object_2);\n\t\nQuerying an Option's inner value via `.unwrap` and querying it again via `.is_none` is also illegal, because `.unwrap` seems to move the value even if no mutations take place and the variable is immutable:\n\n    let demo_collection: Vec&lt;Demo&gt; = Vec::&lt;Demo&gt;::new();\n    let demo_object: Option&lt;Demo&gt; = None;\n\n    for collection_item in demo_collection {\n        if demo_object.is_none() {\n        }\n        \n        if collection_item.value1 &gt; demo_object.unwrap().value1 {\n        }\n    }\n\t\nAnd of course, the HashMap example I mentioned earlier, in which calling `get_mut` apparently counts as mutating the map, regardless of whether the map contains the key being queried or not:\n\n    let mut demo_collection: HashMap&lt;i32, Demo&gt; = HashMap::&lt;i32, Demo&gt;::new();\n    \n    demo_collection.insert(1, Demo::new(1, 2, 3));\n    \n    let mut demo_entry = demo_collection.get_mut(&amp;57);\n    let mut demo_value: &amp;mut Demo;\n    \n    //we can't call .get_mut.unwrap_or, because we can't construct the default\n    //value in-place. We'd have to return a reference to the newly constructed\n\t//default value, which would become invalid immediately. Instead we get to\n\t//do things the long way.\n    let mut default_value: Demo = Demo::new(2, 4, 6);\n    \n    if demo_entry.is_some() {\n        demo_value = demo_entry.unwrap();\n    }\n    else {\n        demo_value = &amp;mut default_value;\n    }\n    \n    demo_collection.insert(1, *demo_value);\n\nNone of this code is especially remarkable or dangerous, but the borrow checker seems absolutely determined to save me from myself. In a lot of cases, I end up writing code which is a lot more verbose than the equivalent Python or C# just trying to work around the borrow checker.\n\nThis is rather tongue-in-cheek, because I understand the borrow checker is integral to what makes Rust tick, but I think I'd enjoy this language a lot more without it.\n\n**Exceptions**\n\nI can't emphasize this one enough, because it's terrifying. The language flat up encourages terminating the program in the event of some unexpected error happening, forcing me to predict every possible execution path ahead of time. There is no forgiveness in the form of try-catch. The best I get is Option or Result, and nobody is required to use them. This puts me at the mercy of every single crate developer for every single crate I'm forced to use. If even one of them decides a specific input should cause a panic, I have to sit and watch my program crash.\n\nSomething like this came up in a Python program I was working on a few days ago - a web-facing third-party library didn't handle a web-related exception and it bubbled up to my program. I just added another except clause to the try-except I already had wrapped around that library call and that took care of the issue. In Rust, I'd have to find a whole new crate because I have no ability to stop this one from crashing everything around it.\n\n**Pushing stuff outside the standard library**\n\nRust deliberately maintains a small standard library. The devs are [concerned](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-do-you-iterate-over-grapheme-clusters-of-a-string-in-rust/11338/4) about the commitment of adding things that \"must remain as-is until the end of time.\"\n\nThis basically forces me into a world where I have to get 50 billion crates with different design philosophies and different ways of doing things to play nicely with each other. It forces me into a world where any one of those crates can and will be abandoned at a moment's notice; I'll probably have to find replacements for everything every few years. And it puts me at the mercy of whoever developed those crates, who has the language's blessing to terminate my program if they feel like it.\n\nMaking more stuff standard would guarantee a consistent design philosophy, provide stronger assurance that things won't panic every three lines, and mean that yes, I can use that language feature as long as the language itself is around (assuming said feature doesn't get deprecated, but even then I'd have enough notice to find something else.)\n\n**Testing is painful**\n\nTests are definitively second class citizens in Rust. Unit tests [are expected](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38995892/how-to-move-tests-into-a-separate-file-for-binaries-in-rusts-cargo/39009227#39009227) to sit in the same file as the production code they're testing. What?\n\nThere's no way to tag tests to run groups of tests later; tests can be run singly, using a wildcard match on the test function name, or can be ignored entirely using `[ignore]`. That's it.\n\n**Language style**\n\nThis one's subjective. I expect to take some flak for this and that's okay.\n* Conditionals with two possible branches should use if-else. Conditionals of three or more branches can use switch statements. Rust tries to wedge match into *everything*. Options are a perfect example of this - either a thing has a value (`is_some()`) or it doesn't (`is_none()`) but examples in the Rust Book only use match.\n* Match syntax is virtually unreadable because the language encourages heavy match use (including nested matches) with large blocks of code and no language feature to separate different blocks. Something like C#'s `break`/`case` statements would be nice here - they signal the end of one case and start another. Requiring each match case to be a short, single line would also be good.\n* Allowing functions to return a value without using the keyword return is awful. It causes my IDE to perpetually freak out when I'm writing a method because it thinks the last line is a malformed return statement. It's harder to read than a `return X` statement would be. It's another example of the Pit of Failure concept from earlier - the natural thing to do (`return X`) is considered non-idiomatic and the super awkward thing to do (`X`) is considered idiomatic.\n* `return if {} else {}` is really bad for readability too. It's a lot simpler to put the return statement *inside* the if and else blocks, where you're actually returning a value.", "author_fullname": "t2_7gkl9y3o", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Beginner's critiques of Rust", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rust", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_hzx1ak", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1596040187.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.rust", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

I just added another except clause to the try-except I already had wrapped around that library call and that took care of the issue. In Rust, I&amp;#39;d have to find a whole new crate because I have no ability to stop this one from crashing everything around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing stuff outside the standard library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rust deliberately maintains a small standard library. The devs are &lt;a href=\"https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-do-you-iterate-over-grapheme-clusters-of-a-string-in-rust/11338/4\"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; about the commitment of adding things that &amp;quot;must remain as-is until the end of time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This basically forces me into a world where I have to get 50 billion crates with different design philosophies and different ways of doing things to play nicely with each other. It forces me into a world where any one of those crates can and will be abandoned at a moment&amp;#39;s notice; I&amp;#39;ll probably have to find replacements for everything every few years. And it puts me at the mercy of whoever developed those crates, who has the language&amp;#39;s blessing to terminate my program if they feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making more stuff standard would guarantee a consistent design philosophy, provide stronger assurance that things won&amp;#39;t panic every three lines, and mean that yes, I can use that language feature as long as the language itself is around (assuming said feature doesn&amp;#39;t get deprecated, but even then I&amp;#39;d have enough notice to find something else.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing is painful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tests are definitively second class citizens in Rust. Unit tests &lt;a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38995892/how-to-move-tests-into-a-separate-file-for-binaries-in-rusts-cargo/39009227#39009227\"&gt;are expected&lt;/a&gt; to sit in the same file as the production code they&amp;#39;re testing. What?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way to tag tests to run groups of tests later; tests can be run singly, using a wildcard match on the test function name, or can be ignored entirely using &lt;code&gt;[ignore]&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one&amp;#39;s subjective. I expect to take some flak for this and that&amp;#39;s okay.\n* Conditionals with two possible branches should use if-else. Conditionals of three or more branches can use switch statements. Rust tries to wedge match into &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Options are a perfect example of this - either a thing has a value (&lt;code&gt;is_some()&lt;/code&gt;) or it doesn&amp;#39;t (&lt;code&gt;is_none()&lt;/code&gt;) but examples in the Rust Book only use match.\n* Match syntax is virtually unreadable because the language encourages heavy match use (including nested matches) with large blocks of code and no language feature to separate different blocks. Something like C#&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements would be nice here - they signal the end of one case and start another. Requiring each match case to be a short, single line would also be good.\n* Allowing functions to return a value without using the keyword return is awful. It causes my IDE to perpetually freak out when I&amp;#39;m writing a method because it thinks the last line is a malformed return statement. It&amp;#39;s harder to read than a &lt;code&gt;return X&lt;/code&gt; statement would be. It&amp;#39;s another example of the Pit of Failure concept from earlier - the natural thing to do (&lt;code&gt;return X&lt;/code&gt;) is considered non-idiomatic and the super awkward thing to do (&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;) is considered idiomatic.\n* &lt;code&gt;return if {} else {}&lt;/code&gt; is really bad for readability too. It&amp;#39;s a lot simpler to put the return statement &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the if and else blocks, where you&amp;#39;re actually returning a value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7lj", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "hzx1ak", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crab1122334", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 49, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/rust/comments/hzx1ak/beginners_critiques_of_rust/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hzx1ak/beginners_critiques_of_rust/", "subreddit_subscribers": 108375, "created_utc": 1596011387.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "rust", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_7evarpqn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A simple crud on rust (with rocket.rs and diesel.rs)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rust", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_hzuoa8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1596028082.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "medium.com", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://medium.com/@luis_50157/a-simple-crud-on-rust-with-rocket-rs-and-diesel-rs-e885672cb23d", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7lj", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "hzuoa8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "luisvmuller", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/rust/comments/hzuoa8/a_simple_crud_on_rust_with_rocketrs_and_dieselrs/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://medium.com/@luis_50157/a-simple-crud-on-rust-with-rocket-rs-and-diesel-rs-e885672cb23d", "subreddit_subscribers": 108375, "created_utc": 1595999282.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "rust", "selftext": "I am currently writing a mircoservice that I wrote with Node to Golang.\n\nI could find that I miss many features of Rust when I use other programming languages.(JavaScript, Python, Golang and Solidity a little bit.)\n\nAm I the only one who feels like this?
