I'm happy that I just published the first two chapters ofÂ **API-only**Â ruby on rails course that IÂ [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/gpebe0/im_planning_to_build_a_rails_course_would_you/)Â almost one month ago on this subreddit. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

In this course, we will build a functional clone ofÂ InstapaperÂ from scratch. Also, it targets the developers already familiar with rails tech stack and has a written format. It's an ongoing course, and I'm planning to share new chapters weekly basis.

You can reach the content fromÂ [https://duetcode.io/rails-api-only-course](https://duetcode.io/rails-api-only-course). Even though it's just two chapters, I wanted to share as early as possible to get some insights and feedback from the audience.

Please, let me know if you have any thoughts/feedback about the content or the website in general.

Knowing what your objects "exactly" do can be hard when debugging a ruby program. Either using \`puts\` or debuggers requires you to jump between files and insert debugging code everywhere.

That's why I created a gem called [tapping\_device](https://github.com/st0012/tapping_device), which can track objects and print all the traces in a nice format with just 1 line of code.

I have a method that returns one this if it is true and another thing if it is false.

    def has_perm?(item)
      return 
          if(true)
            item.this?
          else 
            item.that?
          end
    end

I wanted to write like this but it doesn't work. What is some clean way I can write code for this? The below looks fine but seems unnecessary assignment

    def has_perm?(item)
      result =  
          if(true)
            item.this?
          else 
            item.that?
          end
      result
    end

I released this library of graphql rails generators a few months ago after doing an ungodly amount of typing on a data-heavy application backed by a graphql API. The generators look at your Rails models and generate graphql types, mutations and input types from your database scheme (currently only activerecord supported, but other databases would be trivial to add). 

Hope people find some use from this and saves you a few thousand keystrokes. Cheers.

## [10][Acts As Tracked: Selectively track changes made on your ActiveRecord Models](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/hg8evn/acts_as_tracked_selectively_track_changes_made_on/)

Hi, i've made a gem to selectively track changes on AR models, where audited gem would be an overkill. ActsAsTracked can be plugged into ActiveRecord model, and then used whenever you need a history of changes and actors made on the record.

You can find docs in the [repository](https://github.com/ramblingcode/acts-as-tracked)

Blog post [here](https://www.ramblingcode.dev/posts/track_changes_on_your_activerecord_models/)

Example usage in this [project](https://github.com/ramblingcode/rails6-acts-as-tracked-usage)

Hope you find it useful.
