## [8][[AskJS] Floating point representation yields 100.00001? How to avoid this bug elegantly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/glfg7n/askjs_floating_point_representation_yields/)

I'm getting some math errors when trying to determine the coverage of a box in Javascript.

Obviously the issue above is that there's a slight overflow in one direction when the floating point representation yields slightly greater than the original value.

I can't control those values though as they're given to me by another library.  They're represented as just numbers. If I could represent all of them as BigInt 

I COULD hack it and round the value down if &gt; 100 BUT the issue there is by how much?   If the result were say 105 then there's more likely another bug and I would want to throw an error.  Even something like 100.1 is probably a bug.

Thoughts?
