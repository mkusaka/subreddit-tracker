## [2][Music App with electron and react](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ff94e4/music_app_with_electron_and_react/)

I was bored, so I made this music app with the help of `electron` and `react` in typescript.

It can play music out of any directory you choose and can even download songs into that directory. It stores metadeta about each song and shows you all artists and albums which the songs are from and stores youre last queue so you can pickup where you left off.

The project is far from perfect and any suggestions will be welcome.

PS:

 I use linux so I'm not sure if there will be any bugs in mac or windows

Also you require a Napster API key(for music metadata) and a Google API key(for downloading a video) for proper functionality

Hi, I have a use case where I need to pass a reference to a method and the parameters to call it with at a later point. How do I validate that the parameters are valid upon declaration?

Example of what I need:

```
interface Foo {
    method: Function
    params: /* Parameters of whatever is passed to "method" */
}

const api = {
    method: async (a: number, b: string) =&gt; {},
}

// This should compile
const foo: Foo = {
    method: api.method,
    params: [3, 'baz']
}

// This should NOT compile
const bar: Foo = {
    method: api.method,
    params: ['wrong', 3]
}
```
## [5][TypeORM relationship - relationships by id ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ff0hcr/typeorm_relationship_relationships_by_id/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ff0hcr/typeorm_relationship_relationships_by_id/
---
I've been kinda confused by the relationships as I'm used to save relationship by id, while docs and examples I found suggest to get the entire object and use that instead (Isn't this strange???)

I found this on github addressing this issue ( [https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/447](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/447) ) , where they suggest to use an object with just the id property, but it's from 2017. Is that a good way to do it ? And is it still the only way to do it ? (I find it pretty lame tbh)

    async create( @Body() product: Product) {
        product.category = &lt;any&gt;{ id: product.category };
        return { payload: await this.repository.persist(product) };
    }

Another one suggested to name the column as categoryId and it would work as expected (with id instead of object) but WHY? What does the name have to do with that ??

    @Entity()
    class Product {
    
         @Column({ type: "int", nullable: true })
         categoryId: number;
    
         @ManyToOne(type =&gt; Category)
         @JoinColumn({ name: "categoryId" })
         category: Category;
    
    }

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just confused, help \^\_\^
## [6][Optional chaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fe4r99/optional_chaining/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fe4r99/optional_chaining/
---
For some reason I can't use optional chaining in my new project, other TS features like interfaces, types, ... are working fine. Also my IDE is not throwing out any errors, but upon compiling the code, I get this error for the following line of code:

Line of code: `country: location?.country`

`country: location?.country,`

`SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'`

`at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:895:18)`

What's going on?

## Problem

I want to optimize my TypeScript by replacing all literal enums with their values.

## Why not `const enum`?

* Third-party libraries may not provide them.
* Babel does not support them.

Is it possible to have a function return different return types under different circumstances?

Edit: I mean without overloading.

example:

    const test = (name: string) : int | string =&gt; {
    
        if(name === 'beatdook04') return 200;
    
        return "Who are you?";    
    
    }
    
    test('beatdook04');

As the description implies i'm trying to store actual code from typescript file in a variable so that when I console.log it i'll see the typescript implementation instead of the compiled code.  
Have any of you tried anything similar?   


What I've tried:  
1. Using decorators and Reflection,  but struggle getting the actual code (as a string) as it is in the file.

2. looking at the typescript npm package. There's just so many functions to read up on. 

3.  Tried to retrofit this code [this code](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#user-content-re-printing-sections-of-a-typescript-file) from the typescript compiler API docs for my purposes.

So far I haven't had any luck. All pointers welcome ;)
