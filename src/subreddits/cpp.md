Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work** and **community groups looking for sponsors**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

## [3][Is visiting a C++ committee meeting a good idea if you're not a committee member, nor do you have any proposals?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/em88vy/is_visiting_a_c_committee_meeting_a_good_idea_if/)

Next month there will be a committee meeting in Prague, which is close enough for me to think about visiting. According to  [https://isocpp.org/std/meetings-and-participation](https://isocpp.org/std/meetings-and-participation), the meetings are open to the public. I am interested in learning how these events work and would also like to know what discussions around proposals look like. However I'm not sure it's worthwhile for an average Joe to visit events such as these. Could someone advise whether it's a good idea to ask for a few days off to visit a C++ committee meeting? Is it a good idea to visit for a day or two, or does one have to attend the whole event to gain anything from it?

So, I've been messing around with C++17's fold expressions, std::apply() and variadic lambdas for a small matrix expression template library I'm working on. I put together a nice implementation of Pythons zip() function to make range based for loops natural and have pulled it out into a gist. It supports all the STL containers (even std::vector&lt;bool&gt;). 

Check it out, have I missed something: [github](https://gist.github.com/ConorWilliams/2dc0be178c0917617e475f9da27bf3c6)

Ive learned everything from Pointers to ploymorphism, streams, inheritance, smart pointers, operator overloading , OOP programming and now Im on a STL just getting into generic programming. Im learning online by myself, and I was wondering can I get a job with my knowledge of C++ now ? And how ? If not should I learn mooore C++ ? What do u recommend ?
 
Edit: I do practice on a daily basis. Itd be nice if I make friends with actual programmers here.

Hi, I'm curious on if anyone had any tips on where to get started if I'm interested in using C++ for building trading systems (I don't necessarily expect myself to be able to build something that works but rather just to get more exposure to that line of work)? I'm still in school right now so my knowledge (especially professional use) of the language is limited compared to a lot of the topics discussed here. I'm familiar with all the major STL stuff and all your data structures and algorithms, but more advanced topics like lambdas, move constructors, etc. I'd probably have to review.

I love to code with C++, but I'm not an engineer, and I feel it is more for engineers who program for firmware and microcontrollers, my question how can I can use C++ to program real world applications to get hired?

P.s: I'm not native English speaker so forgive me for any mistakes.

Thank you in advance

## [10][Changing from inheritance to std::variant inverts your header include hierarchy](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/elhf4z/changing_from_inheritance_to_stdvariant_inverts/)

I have some code I originally wrote in a dynamically typed language, and I'm converting it to C++.  This involves applying type discipline to a design which was not designed with static typing in mind.

The code in question (is unrelated to the web, but) was inspired by the idea of cascading style sheets (CSS):  it's a simplified declarative description of complicated runtime objects, so that you describe the style of an object with data and something else constructs it.

An important point is that different subtypes of object style have different sets of valid properties.  So for instance something describing a linear slider has linear min/max properties, while something involving rotation has properties of rotational (angle) limits.

My first approximation was to create a class hierarchy with common-to-all properties in the base class, and many derived classes for the various specific styles.  Standard OOP.

However I decided I wanted to change the style objects to be value types, so that they can be passed by const&amp; or stored by value, without needing to use std::shared\_ptr or other memory management.

In the inheritance model, more-specific style classes included the base class with common properties inside of the derived object.  In the updated design, the former base class (now a value type not a base) becomes the bigger object, containing within it the same common properties and a std::variant of all specific styles as a sub-object.

What I found interesting was in the inheritance design the specific style header(s) included the base style header, but with a std::variant based design that relationship is inverted; what had been the base class header now includes all the of the specific style header(s) (in order to be able to describe what's in the std::variant).

This may seem to be a trivial detail about header includes, but I believe in this case it also a deeper point about the difference between inheritance based designs and std::variant based designs.

**tl;dr:**  When using inheritance, the more specific class(es) depend(s) on the more abstract class.  When using std::variant, the more abstract class depends on the more specific class(es).
## [11][Is there any reason why C++20 does not contain constexpr functions for converting to and/or from strings?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/elfpmk/is_there_any_reason_why_c20_does_not_contain/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/elfpmk/is_there_any_reason_why_c20_does_not_contain/

Since [More constexpr containers](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0784r7.html) and [Making std::string constexpr](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0980r1.pdf) were accepted to C++20, allowing transient allocations with strings, is there any reason why there is no way to convert the string to numeric values and vice versa in constexpr context? p0980r1 basically makes everything constexpr in the string header, except for the streaming operators, `getline` and the string conversions. While it's kind of obvious why the first two are not constexpr, I don't see any reason why the last one couldn't be. Initially I thought this would be supported by `std::from_chars` and `std::to_chars` since they are non-allocating, but there seems to be no push to make these constexpr either. The C functions with similar functionality are also out of the picture due to... well, being C functions. 

Is there a way something like this could still get into C++20, at least for the from\_chars-like variant  (e.g. via NB comments), or at least C++23? Or is there something I'm missing?
