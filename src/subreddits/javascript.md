I asked this on /r/react and didn't get any replies, maybe someone here can help here.

I keep reading about how React's Virtual DOM is more efficient than the browser because it 'only updates the parts which need to update'.

Do web browsers in 2020 not do something similar? Surely they don't update the whole DOM and repaint the whole window every time Javascript appends one &lt;li&gt; to a list?

I'm kind of struggling with this point not making sense to me.
