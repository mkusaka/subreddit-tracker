Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

Now I have decided to start C++. I am complete beginner. I can learn fast. My mathematical background is very good. I prefer learning from books as they are more detailed and contain a smooth learning curve. What do you feel is the best book: C++ Primer ,  Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 2nd Edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup , The programming language C++ , C++ for dummies , C++ how to program , C++ crash course :a fast paced introduction, Absolute c++.

## [4][Library for 2D skeletal animation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/iodnn5/library_for_2d_skeletal_animation/)

Hello everyone,

The title speaks for itself really. I'd like to do skeletal animation with sprites, but I don't want to have to create my own rigging system if any are already available. Does anyone know of such a library, that allows you to create bones, link them to each other and to sprites, use IK chains, and so on? If it talks nicely to SFML that would be even better. Thank you for any suggestions!

\[EDIT\] Just to clarify: I'm not looking to create animations using an animation creator and then implement them in my project. I want to create them \*within\* my project. I'm imagining something vaguely along these lines:

    bone bone1;
    bone bone2;
    
    bone2.attach(bone1);
    
    bone1.set_sprite(sprite1);
    bone2.set_sprite(sprite2);
    
    for (int i=0; i&lt;360; i++)
        bone2.rotate(1);

Obviously that's absurdly over-simple but hopefully it gives a sense of the sort of thing I'm trying to do. Within my project, I want to create a wide variety of objects with different skeletons and skins, so just importing assets won't work.

I created a similar post a few hours back but realised that I hadnt mentioned a few good books.I removed the less recommended books too. Please vote again.

This poll gives more options . Please vote again.**BUT REMEMBER TO VOTE FROM A BEGINNER'S POINT OF VIEW.**

Going by recent discussions on ABI stability/breakage, I believe ABI versioning is the way forward. What are the reasons why the community is not working with vendors to put in place mechanisms to support versioning the C++ ABI on each platform? This is the direction Herb Sutter proposed in N4028 if I’m correct.
