We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

[ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript, emotion-js, react-beautiful-dnd, and PWA](https://reddit.com/link/htcw9l/video/8f81dtxoekb51/player)

Hello everyone!

I built this project to improve my front-end skills and learn more about web capabilities using ReactJS. This project doesn't even come close to the real iOS home screen, my goal was to focus on things like drag and drop and native browser scrolling interactions.

BTW at some point  I got concerned about releasing this project due to possible copyright issues. Could anyone confirm that this project is not a copyright infringement? All application icons are from icons8 and are based on the license agreement.

Feel free to make a PR review and please and let me know what I'm doing wrong.

## [8][Creating an animation that involves elements of multiple components.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htg71k/creating_an_animation_that_involves_elements_of/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htg71k/creating_an_animation_that_involves_elements_of/
---
Hi, beginner to React here.

I am using GSAP for my animations, but I think this question would apply to any method of animating multiple elements from multiple components.

For example, I have a video page which has 2 components, the actial video and a section along the bottom of the page which contains textual information about the video.

When the page loads I am animating the text in the bottom component first but then I want to animate some things in the video component, in the same timeline.

Now, where do I write my animation code which uses the Refs. Because if I write this in my video component then the Refs from the text component will be missing and it won't work.

Do I need to write the animation in the App component?

Or do I need to somehow communicate between components?
## [9][React Hash Router with Django on server side - Refreshing page returns to base, home, URL](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htf6cc/react_hash_router_with_django_on_server_side/)

Hey guys,

I've been stuck on this issue for a while now and I need your help. Hopefully this is not much to ask.

I have a full stack project on my hands, backend built with django and frontend with react. I am facing an issue with React router whenever I refresh the page it goes back to the base URL ("[example.com/](https://example.com/)"). Since I am hosting backend and frontend on the same port I have setup Django URL '/' to serve index.html file where React scripts are sitting.

All of my routes are working as I have planned but the only problem is if a user refreshes the page it goes back to home page and it's driving me nuts. I understand that server is the first one that is parsing an URL and react router is loaded only when scripts in index.html file are loaded. How can I resolve this issue? I am using HashRouter to avoid 404 errors on server side.

Hopefully I was clear with my question, as always, any help/answer is appreciated. Thanks!
## [10][At which point does Context API become unreliable and Redux is required?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htel86/at_which_point_does_context_api_become_unreliable/)

Hi guys. I'm pretty new to React. Recently learned about Context API and based on some Googling, Context API supposed to solve props drilling issues. As I understand, prior to Context API, Redux was used to solve this issue. I also understand that Redux can do "so much more". Now, my question is, what is that "so much more"? In what kind of situation we should use Redux instead of Context API?

I just made a code pair platform. In this application, users can share an interactive editor and write code together. It has language support for C++, Java and python. This application is based on the concept of operational transformation which forms the basis for a shared editor. Video calling is also provided within this application. It has some similar features as provided by [HackerRank's CodePair](https://www.hackerrank.com/products/codepair/) platform. You can see the code here - [https://github.com/RisingGeek/CodeEditor](https://github.com/RisingGeek/CodeEditor)

## [12][Help needed with HERE maps (clustering) integration to react app](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htdh96/help_needed_with_here_maps_clustering_integration/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/htdh96/help_needed_with_here_maps_clustering_integration/
---
I am able to integrate the Here maps clustering overlay with dummy data but not able to manipulate the data I am getting from an api to use it correctly.

I have been messing about with so many different JS array and object methods for the last 2 days the I have lost track of what I have tried and haven't tried.

My JSON response from the api is:

    [0 â€¦ 99]
    0:
    coordinates: Array(2)
    0: 24.77234
    1: 59.43862
    length: 2
    __proto__: Array(0)
    type: "Point"
    __proto__: Object
    1: {type: "Point", coordinates: Array(2)}

and code for this function:

    const getTlnBusData = async () =&gt; {

const test = await gpsData.flatMap((vehicle) =&gt; \[vehicle.geometry\]); console.log('test', test); const testValues = Object.values(test); console.log('testValues', testValues); // const coords = \[el.geometry.coordinates\]; // console.log('batman', coords);

const dataPoints = \[\]; dataPoints.push(new H.clustering.DataPoint(51.01, 0.01)); dataPoints.push(new H.clustering.DataPoint(50.04, 1.01)); dataPoints.push(new H.clustering.DataPoint(51.45, 1.01)); dataPoints.push(new H.clustering.DataPoint(51.01, 2.01));

/\*\* \* Assuming that 'dataPoints' and 'map' \* is initialized and available, create a data provider: \*/ const clusteredDataProvider = new H.clustering.Provider(dataPoints);

// Create a layer that includes the data provider and its data points: const layer = new H.map.layer.ObjectLayer(clusteredDataProvider);

// Add the layer to the map: hMap.addLayer(layer); }; getTlnBusData();

I have tried variations of forEach, loop, map/flatMap and I can't seem to replace the dummy data with any of my solutions.

Can anyone point me in the right direction please?

&amp;#x200B;

TIA!
