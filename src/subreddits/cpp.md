Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

I made the project "SugarPP" as my self-made C++ syntactic sugar collection. As a side project, it aims to port some nice features from other languages to C++ (as intuitive as it can possibly get). And I have great fun doing it XD.

Currently, the undocumented code is the part I am still working on ~~but somehow get committed~~.

I am humbly looking for advices/new ideas/suggestions/bug reviews/contributions. As I only have a little more than 1 year of C++ experience, the code may be extremely buggy. Please be specific about any issues that I have.

Hello everyone! I am a master’s student studying Computational Modeling and Simulation. Whenever I start looking at Computer Vision job descriptions I come across C++ as a requirement, so I have decided to learn it. The problem is that I have some experience in Java and python so I need a resource which doesn’t focus more on the barebones (basic oop) and I am facing hard time finding one. This community has a lot of experienced developers, can you suggest a good resource to start with?

Hi everyone!

It started as a toy project, but I think it might help others, especially C++ learners.

The goal is for it to be an index of conference talks with a community-managed (on [Github](https://github.com/Ethiraric/cpptalksindex)) list of tags for each conference that can be searched for.
There is one, namely, that I would like to be assigned to introductory talks that could be a great introduction to a particular subject, however difficult it is (one I watched recently was Jody Hagin's [talk on metaprogramming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiAVWcjIF6o)).

I am watching videos here and there and adding them as I go.

The website is far from finished yet, namely:

  * It needs a bit of design, more than the 10 lines of CSS I wrote.

  * It probably has a lot of UX flaws.

  * I need your help, especially if you watch a lot of talks, to complete the talk list.

  * I'm not good with Unicode, so I probably have butchered some names and talk titles. I offer my sincere apologies to those it affected.

I'm linking this here in order to get some feedback, on whether you think this idea is worth or not.

Stay safe!

P.S.: In order to have some results on the site, since there are just a few talks, you can filter just by speaker or by tag.
## [6][Question about "Internal Variable "Result""](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/j62j2s/question_about_internal_variable_result/)

Hey folks, 

Kinda stumped by what this question means, here is it:

"Modify stub( ) so that it now takes all three variables as input (arguments) and returns true/false value associated with an internal variable "result" that is initialised as 0" 

I \*think\* it's asking me to declare a variable named "result" inside function "stub", declare as bool false, check it against values of args, if args = bool true, then "result" = bool true   


I'm only a couple weeks new to C++ so still getting to grips with the terminology, cheers folks  ✌️

I come from a iOS and C++ background. Always wondered how the dispatching of the events worked under the hood in iOS. I bought myself a Teensy 4.0 so I can start from the very basics implementing the event library.

This learning journey will involve me writing a framework that will enable taking callbacks on a particular pin on events such as button pressed, button long pressed, etc. 

I am not asking how teensy works. I am more interested in the architecture of the framework. And also being able to expand to various events later on.

Will someone guide me through this journey.
