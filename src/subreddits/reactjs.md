We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hello all!

My old personal website/portfolio was old (made in 2019) and using a Gatsby starter (that was the time when I was starting to learn JavaScript).

Now,  several months and side projects/university projects later, I have completely rewritten my portfolio, absolutely from scratch, using React and Gatsby!

I have also written a small NodeJS backend to integrate my frontend with Azure, where I store all my images for the gallery page! Any constructive feedback is more than welcome, I hope you enjoy the site guys!!

I just recently released my first react library - `react-xarrows`, which is about component that connects between elements with an arrow or line.

you can customize the look(color,thickness ,etc) and behavior(curveness,anchors,etc).

and I would love to get reviews and suggestions about it.

I have a react website published on github pages, my hompage and repository is 

    /websiteName

so it's working when I'm at the hompage, ex: 

    username.github.io/websiteName

. But I also have a route which is 

    /user/:id

, so when I click a link it will redirect me to 

    username.github.io/user/123

thus giving me a 404 error. So how do I fix the 404 error when redirecting to a different route other than 

    /websiteName

.

Hello r/reactjs!

I am a new self taught JS developer and over the past few weeks built my first react app without the use of tutorials. This application is a recreation of the functionality of a clothing website utilizing many different react features like controlled forms and hooks. 

I am seeking feedback on this project to help me grow as a new developer. Ultimately, my goal is to get a job as a JS/react dev as I‚Äôve really enjoyed the process of learning and building different projects so any feedback to help we grow is much appreciated! 

The project code can be found [here](https://github.com/dhaef/ecom-sample) and it‚Äôs hosted on heroku [here](https://dhaef-react-ecom.herokuapp.com/)

Thanks!
