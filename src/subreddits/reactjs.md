We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi, React Redditors!

Recently I watched Thomas Weibenfalk's (freecodecamp YouTube channel) tutorial on "How to Build Tetris in React" and remembered a less known but still memorable game from my childhood where you had to avoid hit "cars" by moving left and right. So inspired by this tutorial, I decided to build my own version of (I don't actually know how this game is called, but I called it -) Tetris Racing.

Here's the [demo](https://ckkz-it.github.io/react-tetris-racing/) and [source code](https://github.com/ckkz-it/react-tetris-racing/).

Current functionality and technologies used you can find in the project's readme file.

Hi Guys!

I recently pushed an update to React Native Responsive Dimensions (v3.1.0). This update focuses on adding new utilities that will help with building apps for foldable devices &amp; react-native-web apps.

New features:
- Full typescript support
- Separate utilities for Responsive "window" &amp; "screen" sizes (screen sizes will be useful while working with foldables)
- New responsive screen size hooks
- `useDimensionsChange` hook to let your application respond to dimension changes

Checkout the example projects at [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@daniakash/responsive-dimensions) &amp; [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-native-responsive-dimensions-hooks-2cqm8)

Feedbacks &amp; Feature Requests all welcome! Do let me know your thoughts üòÅ

Hello folks!

I have been doing web Development on my 10 years old HP laptop which has intel core i3 and 4GB of RAM and an HDD. I'm looking to get something new because the HP is so slow.

I'm thinking about buying a Macbook pro because I may need the mobility someday. But it's expensive and my country doesn't have any Apple stores to get support from if anything happened to my Macbook pro. 

I'm also thinking about a PC build even though they are expensive as well in Morocco, but the problem with a pc is that I will have to pay for a monitor, Keyboard, and mouse.

A used 15' i7 16GB  512GB MacBook Pro 2018 cost around 1800 USD, 
While the whole PC build and its peripherals would cost more than 2000 USD.

For example a used Macbooks Pro 2018 in the picture bellow cost 
And the PC cost

I want to test that the dispatch here is called:

       onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) =&gt; {
              setSubmitting(true);
              const { id, text} = values;
              dispatch(fetchData(id, text));
            }}

My Test:

        const dispatch = store.dispatch();
        await updateField(wrapper.find('input[name="id"]'), "id", 123);
        await updateField(wrapper.find('input[name="text"]'), "text", "hi");
        const button = wrapper.find(Button);
        expect(button.props().type).toEqual("submit");
        await submitFormikForm(button);
        expect(dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fetchData(123, "hi"));

Mocking the store using the following:

    const middlewares = [
      thunk.withExtraArgument({ fetchData: () =&gt; Promise.resolve() })
    ];
    const mockStore = configureMockStore(middlewares);
    const store = mockStore({});

Gives out the error:  Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions. Even though I have passed thunk. Any ideas or suggestions on what to do here. I am completely running out of ideas here. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I was wondering if there were a full Page Animation library kind of like [react-transition-group](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transition-group) but which can take a grid and apply different animations based on the relative direction the two pages are in?
