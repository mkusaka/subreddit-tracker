**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

So i know basic C++ but I decided to just ignore that and start C++ from scratch. Whats the best course/resources to learn everything about C++ starting right from the basics and covering data structures etc in depth?

I posted to r/cpp_questions first and couldn't get a consensus on whether the following is defined in the standard or is just something that tends to work. My end goal is to write a bignum class for modular arithmetic.

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;array&gt;
    #include &lt;type_traits&gt;
    
    union arrayunion {
        std::array&lt;unsigned,4&gt; big;
        std::array&lt;unsigned,2&gt; small;
    };
    
    int main() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; std::is_standard_layout_v&lt;std::array&lt;unsigned,4&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; '\n';
        std::cout &lt;&lt; std::is_standard_layout_v&lt;std::array&lt;unsigned,2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; '\n';
        std::cout &lt;&lt; std::is_standard_layout_v&lt;arrayunion&gt; &lt;&lt; '\n';
        arrayunion arr;
        arr.big = {1,2,3,4};
        auto small_arr = arr.small;
        for(const auto&amp; v : small_arr)  std::cout &lt;&lt; v &lt;&lt; "\n";
        return 0;
    }
    /*
    outputs:
    true
    true
    true
    1
    2
    */

Could anyone comment? Can I reason that the first two unsigned values are active members, everything is standard layout and involves the same type: `unsigned`, and therefore, the type-punning is allowed in this specific case?

If I asked the same question with C-style arrays, would the answer be the same?

 Hello, this week-end I have been making a password generator, however I've heard that my code is quite trashy so I'd like to know where I can improve. Nonetheless, I can help myself feeling proud of this little project.

Here is the code :

I'm trying to find a good place to learn c++. I've mostly been working in Matlab/Simulink for over 5 years now. But learning c++ would be very useful in my career. So far in my search, Udacity's program looks well structured and project-based (which I really like). But the price seems to be exorbitant.

I would like to hear from someone who's taken this course and if they recommend it. Also please feel free to suggest other good courses or tutorials for c++.
## [12][Any ongoing proposal for replacement of printf with safer `std::format` like formatting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h9pzq2/any_ongoing_proposal_for_replacement_of_printf/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/h9pzq2/any_ongoing_proposal_for_replacement_of_printf/
---
One could use `std::cout &lt;&lt; std::format(&lt;format_str&gt;, args...);`, but streams based solution seems to be much slower due to the calls to `std::basic_ostream` types - streams aren't featherweight.

Moreover, using `std::cout` with `std::format` seems like a overkill especially when `std::format` can already do most of the work i.e conversion to `std::string`, field-width, space filling etc which also "deprecates" some features from &lt;iomanip&gt; header.

I know there's `std::format_to` which works with `std::ostream_iterator` but `std::stream_iterator` builds on top of the `std::cout` abstraction, so we can/should definitely do better like `fmt::print`.
