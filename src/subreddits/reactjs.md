We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi I have a question about the following code, this code makes a rest call with axios to a server, the value returns correctly from the node.js server, that is, if I test the call with postman I have a response with the integer value however in this case the value is undefined what is it due to?

 `axios.post(apiBaseUrl+'/utente/login', payload,header).then(function (response) {            console.log("\n Valore di response.data:"+response.data); //Undefinend?            }`

I am super excited to share my first major open source project called Appwrite and I would really appreciate your feedbacks. üôè

Appwrite is an open-source platform for developers that abstracts and simplifies common and repeating development tasks behind REST APIs, in order to help developers build apps way faster.

Appwrite has many cool services like a DB which integrate directly into clients, file upload and file cropping management, user authentication (OAuth support, password recovery and more) and many more cool services that all try to make developers life a lot more easy and less frustrating.

The best way to learn more is to visit the project website and docs (https://appwrite.io/docs) or to check out the GitHub repository (https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite).

The project is just at the start of its way, any feedback will be very much appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hey guys, what is the best practice, in terms of performance, for setting and calling variables in a components state?

Let's say I have a function that continuously calls and modifies the same variable. Is it better to call it from State once, use it within the function, and then update the state at the end... Or is it just as fast to continuously refer to the state variable (this.state.variable and this.setState(variable: update)) within the function?

Pretend that you're a new react user reading the initial docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) or following their official [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), I think most new users would get the idea that Class components are the way to go and hooks just some weird advanced features.

Is there any reason to start learning with class components when almost everyone agrees that hooks are the prefered way to write code in react?
## [10][Formik / Uncontrolled input of elements with dynamic (api fetched) names?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fo3mlh/formik_uncontrolled_input_of_elements_with/)

Hello

I am fetching list of checkboxes from API which in typescript looks like that:

    product: { list: { [key: string]: boolean } }

So, while using Formik, my fiend name varies and are dynamically created. Some examples:

    product.list.users
    product.list.parts
    product.list.utils

However, since Formik's Form initial values cannot be fetched before the API request happens (UX), I really don't have initial values for these checkboxes (users, parts, utils). Therefore I am getting an error about transitioning from uncontrolled input to controlled ones.

Anything I can do about it?

I want to create a blogging app using react.js in the frontend and want to use Django and postgres in the backend. What all are the things I need to keep in mind while integrating the frontend and the backend. The app will include routing to different pages. Also I want to include authentication. I want to know all the steps that I should take to make the app efficiently.
Any kind of help from my fellow developers will be appreciated.
