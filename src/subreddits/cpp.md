**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

hey /r/Cpp. I recently graduated from Uni in April and since then I've been trying to write a 3D graphics engine in C++ using OpenGL. I've been having lots of fun with this project and I pretty much work on it 50 hours a week since there's not much else for me to do right now. 

That being said, I feel like I'm doing something very wrong. My process for writing code is pretty straight forward. I write new classes and methods as needed to support new features. I use modern C++ features like smart pointers. And I make an effort to pass parameters by const ref as needed. I understand concepts  like lvalue, rvalue, move semantics. And I use Catch2 for unit testing. I use printfs to debug in to the console, and if the intended output is not correct I use the visual studio debugger to step through my program and look at how  values change  in the immediate window. I haven't found much of a need to use templates in my project so far(is that a bad thing?). 

Then I come to these forums and see people talk about stuff ive never even  heard about. I feel like I am using a completely different language. sometimes. 

Also, why does C++ get such a bad rep? People say manual memory management but that doesn't seem to be an issue with smart pointers? Writing C++ seems to be pretty straightforward to me so far, aside from the weird compiler errors you get time to time, and knowing what headers to include. I heard the build process for C++ sucks but don't you just use Cmake? 

A former professor of mine recently reached out to me and asked if I wanted to help with his reasearch in algorithms and DSP. I guess maybe he needs some C++ guys. But I don't know if I'm even qualified to be honest.

EDIT: sorry, I misphrased by saying that C++ is straightforward. It is hard and the more I learn about it, I realize how deep the rabbit hole goes. I find in straightforward in the sense that I find learning it to be manageable by taking it slow and refactoring old code as I learn more. It is easy to say that it is straightforward, but it is also easy to forget how much time I have already spent learning it, and how much I still don't know.
