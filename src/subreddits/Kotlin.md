Hi, I recently started learning Kotlin and Android Development. Already developed some basic applications, now I want to consume data from APIs and show them on the app. Do you recommend any beginner tutorial on how to connect to APIs?

Hello peeps,

I’m new to programming and kotlin and I was told that I will get better if I build something on my own. I did something similar with JavaScript from an online Udemy course and I made a simple website. Do you have any suggestions for projects that are not android? 

Thank you :)

I am using Kotlin to create an Android App. The problem I am having is I’m trying to use a ViewModel to create an user in Firebase. After the user is created, something should be returned to the UI Fragment to let the fragment know to move forward to the next line of execution. The trouble I’m having is Firebase operations are done asynchronously, so there’s no way for me the front end to know the operation is done executing in the view model. Is there a way to create a callback or fix this?

I was trying to convert a string to binary and I was able to do so using text.*toByteArray*().*joinToString*(separator = " ") and then I would convert the integers to binary. But when I try to convert an emoji to binary, the integers are negative. Why does this happen and can someone tell me how to fix it?
