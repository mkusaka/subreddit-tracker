Hey everyone,

So I'm currently looking to teach myself programming with the goal of breaking into the industry. I've found a program I want to use, Launch School, that offers two tracks. One is Ruby and the other is Javascript. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was leaning towards the JS track just because I know that JS gets used a lot, but the Ruby track will teach back-end with Ruby and front-end JS so I'd eventually end up learning both and I've heard Ruby is a good language to start with.  My only concern about Ruby is I seem to run across a lot of "Ruby is dead/dying" posts and articles so I thought I'd ask here for some feedback on if you all think Ruby is a good starting point for someone who wants to make a career in CS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all in advance for any advice.

So, I was updating some dependencies in some repos I have and noticed Facets has not been updated since 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone got any idea why?
