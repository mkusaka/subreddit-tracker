I am trying to create a game using the Gosu library. The question is that i have multiple screens such as the welcome screen which the user must see once they run the program. The. I want to implement a functionality where when the user clicks on a button and it gets redirected to the screen where my actual game is. The part of redirecting is what I am confused with.

How can I install a recent version of Ruby on a very old Mac Pro (pre 2008)? It's running OS X Lion 10.7.5, and Safari won't even load many of the pages on the internet - says "can't establish a secure connection").
