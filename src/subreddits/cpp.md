**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

# Lexicon

Term | Meaning
-|-
**Cancelled** | The event will not happen on the planned dates and will not be rescheduled in 2020.
**Postponed** | The event will not happen on the planned dates but may happen later in 2020.
**Virtual** | The event is now virtual.
**No Date Changes Yet** | The event has not announced any changes to the planned dates.

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

## Link

GitHub: https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2

## Introduction/Motivation

1. I wrote a csv library last year and it turned out like crap.
   - Got some good feedback from Reddit. But, the library was poorly designed, became buggy, and was generally hard to maintain.
2. I've used [fast-cpp-csv-parser](https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser) in the past. It's great (and fast!) but requires the user to know a lot at compile time, e.g., `column_count`, `column_names` etc.
3. I wanted to see what performance could be achieved by parsing single-threaded and managing internal objects with `std::string_view`.

It seems to be pretty hard to find benchmarks for (or comparisons between) existing CSV parsers in C++.

* Each CSV parser (including this one) provides a different interface to read files and access rows.
* Some CSV parsers are lenient w.r.t [RFC-4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) compliance while others perform strict checking, sometimes throwing exceptions on compliance failures.
* Some CSV parsers provide performance measurements on either programmatically generated data or simple (now unavailable) test CSV files.
  - For this library, I decided to use publicly available datasets from Kaggle.com

I'd love your feedback on this library. Specifically, I'd like to know if the performance measurements (see below) are competitive. Any tips on how to improve `ifstream` read speeds or tokenization would also be greatly appreciated. Following [this](https://lemire.me/blog/2012/06/26/which-is-fastest-read-fread-ifstream-or-mmap/) blog post by Daniel Lemire, I haven't bothered with mmap. 

## Highlights

* Single-threaded - No additional worker threads.
* Lazy evaluated - Tokenization is not performed until the row is read using `read_row()`.
* Single header file - Just include `&lt;csv2/reader.hpp&gt;`
* MIT License.

## Performance Benchmark

The benchmarks program measures two execution times:

* **Measurement 1 (M1)**: Load input CSV file and build the list of lines (`std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;`).
* **Measurement 2 (M2)**: Iterate over all the lines, tokenize each line and construct a `std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;std::string_view&gt;&gt;` rows list.

I am setting up **GNU Emacs as C/C++ IDE with lsp-mode, langd, and cmake, using use-package**.

I do have the lists:  [https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz](https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz), and  [https://github.com/topics/emacs-configuration](https://github.com/topics/emacs-configuration).

But, I am unable to identify a ***class C++ configuration by a seasoned professional***, using the said packages/ tools.

Can someone help me, please?
