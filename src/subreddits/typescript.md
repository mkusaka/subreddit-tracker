## [2][Bring some structure to your file and directory names with ls-lint](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fk4rc3/bring_some_structure_to_your_file_and_directory/)

Hey, worked on this a couple of weeks:

GitHub: [ls-lint](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint)

From time to time its hard to keep a clean naming structure in your projects. [ls-lint](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint) would solves this issue easily for all of your files and directories. With a simple .ls-lint.yml file, ls-lint makes sure that all your files are at the right place.

**Benefits:**

\- Works for directory and file names (all extensions supported)

\- Linux &amp; Mac Support (Windows coming soon)

\- Incredibly fast

\- Full unicode support

\- Almost zero third-party dependencies (only go-yaml)

**Example &amp; How-to (vue.js)**

    # .ls-lint.yml
    
    ls:
      .dir: regex:[a-z0-9\-]+
      .js: kebab-case
      .css: kebab-case
      .html: kebab-case
      .json: kebab-case
      .ts: kebab-case
      .sh: kebab-case
      .dev.js: kebab-case
      .prod.js: kebab-case
      .d.ts: kebab-case
      .vdom.js: kebab-case
      .spec.js: kebab-case
    
      dist:
        .js: point.case
    
      benchmarks/ssr:
        .js: camelCase
    
    ignore:
      - test
      - benchmarks/dbmon/ENV.js
      - .babelrc.js
      - .eslintrc.js
      - .github
      - .circleci
      - .git

Would love to get some feedback :-)

Pull requests are welcome!
## [3][How do I assign a type to a property that is supposed to accept any React component](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fjufi8/how_do_i_assign_a_type_to_a_property_that_is/)

    type AnyComponent&lt;Props,State&gt; = FC&lt;Props&gt; | Component&lt;Props,State&gt;;
    
    interface CreatorArgs {
    	component: AnyComponent&lt;object, object&gt;; // I'll get more specific here once this works
    }
    
    // Much later in the code, creatorArgs: CreatorArgs
    
    const Component: AnyComponent&lt;object, object&gt; = creatorArgs.component;
    
    const output = () =&gt; (
    	&lt;Component /&gt; // JSX element type 'Component' does not have any construct or call signatures.
    );

So the code sample is above. Basically I'm writing a function, one of the arguments to this function is a React component. This should be able to be either a class component or a functional component. I tried creating a union type for them, but I'm getting the error in the comment above, where it doesn't have any constructor or call signature.

I'm an experienced JS dev trying to boost my TS skills here. Looking for guidance. Thanks.

As the title says,

I've spent the last week poking around and trying different starter, but I am still unable to compile the library correctly. It is driving me crazy and I don't understand why I can't compile it.

Error:

I need help, `tsc` and `ts-node` do not recognise the custom path aliases specified in my `tsconfig.json` file. My file is as follows:

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "strict": true,
        "jsx": "preserve",
        "importHelpers": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "types": ["webpack-env", "jest", "node"],
        "paths": {
          "@/*": ["src/*"]
        },
        "lib": ["esnext", "dom", "dom.iterable", "scripthost"]
      },
      "include": [
        "src/**/*.ts",
        "src/**/*.tsx",
        "src/**/*.vue",
        "tests/**/*.ts",
        "tests/**/*.tsx"
      ],
      "exclude": ["node_modules"]
    }

My IDE recognises the paths and I'm able to use the imported values as expected but when I compile any TS file or use `ts-node` on them, I get the error that the module is not recognised. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks fellas.

EDIT: **SOLVED** thanks to /u/moremattymattmatt, I had to install the `tsconfig-paths` npm package to use path aliasing.

I was wondering if anyone had a simple and good example/tutorial/course on how to set up an NPM package written in Typescript on Azure DevOps?

Pretty new at Azure DevOps, and the repository itself is no problem, but I don't know how to:

  1. set up pipelines
  2. how to deal with npm package versioning (since package.json needs to be updated)
  3. how to publish it to the Artifacts npm feed.

using angular 7 iirc and TS.  I have an API written in go and part of this API call is to return data as well as a base64 image.  In my TS side, I have to use a santizer and then a bypasssecurity method which just seems really odd.

is there a better way to do something like this?

Recently I've created my first npm [package](https://github.com/ceoro9/ioc-ts). It's a "lazy" inversion of control container. And yes, I heard about inversify, the things I don't like in it, that it's too bloated and does not support no-decorator constructor injection, like in NestJS. And btw it seems like inversify lacks activity. Anyway, for me the main goal was learning, but I'll be very glad if somebody can rate my code and leave some feedback, for now I'm just a junior dev, so for me any feedback is really valuable. May be somebody would like to help in writing more tests and docs, I welcome everybody.

Also I don't know if I can ask for this, but tomorrow I am going to the job interview and to make a good impression on a interviewer, I'll be very glad if somebody can put a star on my github repo. I'd really appreciate this.

What should be the correct way of mentioning global types?

- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fisz4q/put_together_an_illustration_to_clear_up_my_own/

The naming of the Union and Intersection operators had always felt curious to me, as it seemed in direct contrast to their respective functions. Why do we call `&amp;` the Intersection operator when the declared object possesses not only the mutual members, but the members of all concerning types? Why do we call `|` Union when the declared object can only reference the mutual members? Recently stumbled upon an SO question asking the same things and decided to finally sit down and reason through it. While the existing answers are great and helped a good deal, I figured it might be of value to put my own understanding down (in good old graphic form) for others who may fall for the same misinterpretive line of thinking.

## [11][Correct way of storing interfaces in TypeScript](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fi8v85/correct_way_of_storing_interfaces_in_typescript/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/fi8v85/correct_way_of_storing_interfaces_in_typescript/
---
New to TS here. When I have to declare objects, I create their corresponding interfaces in the same file.

```ts
// Interfaces
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface City {
  state: string;
  zipcode: string;
}

// Objects
const bob: User = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 20
}

const boston: City = {
  state: 'MA',
  zipcode: '02022'
}
```
1. What is the correct way of storing interfaces? Is it storing all of them in one file and importing as needed or is it storing one interface per file?

2. What is the role of `.d.ts` files here? Can we store all interfaces under one namespace in a `.d.ts` file?
