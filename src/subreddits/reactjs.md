We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I am currently working in a project where the components are not predefined and I have to display content by merging template json and a data json which are fetched from an API and I am currently using MustacheJS and react-mustache-template to acheive this. I can easily creates lists and simple components.

But the problem comes while creating components with interactivity, not simple lists but graphs , charts and carousels; and Mustache templates does not help me acheive this, furthermore since I am using react-mustache-template package I can onlly use pure HTML elements in my templates , custom React components or library components do not work, how do I solve this problem?

Calling getSearchResults WebAPI with Axios and update the state with response using setSearchResults() custom hook. It looks like my view is not getting re-rendered thought I get response. I assume it is due due async method call, can someone help how to resolve the issue to bind my state with view once the state is updated?  


    code block 

const handleSearchSubmit = () =&gt; {  
getSearchResults(formatSearchCriteriaSelections())  
.then(data =&gt; {  
setSearchResults(data)  
})  
};  
Updating State:  


    code block 

case "SET\_SEARCH\_RESULTS":  
return {  
...state,  
searchData:  
{  
...state.searchData,  
results:  
{  
projects: \[state.searchData.results.projects, Object.entries(action.payload.filter(result =&gt; result.ResultType === 'Project'))\],  
proposals: \[state.searchData.results.proposals, Object.entries(action.payload.filter(result =&gt; result.ResultType === 'Proposal'))\]  
},  
criteria: state.searchData  
}  
};  
My view simply displays:  


    code block 

({searchData.results.length &gt; 0 ? searchData.results.proposals\[0\].name : ''})
