This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Hi,

So I was recently trying to create an App, which involved Switching Theme From Light To Dark And Dark To Light in which I discovered that PocoX2, uses a custom dark theme, and the value of DefaultNightMode was Unspecified i.e. -100 instead of being 2. When using This.

If anyone has managed to build a workaround for this issue, please post it in the **StackOverflow** question below.

So wrapping up my question was, Is this a ROM Specific Issue? And does a solution exist?

Here is a **Stackoverflow** Link.

Would you rather stick to your default android system lock screen or rather use a third party lock screen app that will provide:

• A lot of customizations and unique themes(each theme will be different with unique designs) 
• fonts and icon effects which would also support icon packs 
• will work on top of your android system lock screen and you won't have to unlock your device twice 
• will work without disabling your system lock screen
• will allow you to use installed app widgets in the custom lock screen
• and many more 

So any thoughts?

Hi all, I’m researching how user-feedback is used in software development for VU University Amsterdam. I already interviewed 20 people and now I ‘m sending a survey to get data from a broad audience (small &amp; large companies). I need 100 people that work with user-feedback or know how their company uses user feedback to fill out this survey. 

Would you be able to help and fill out a 7 minute survey (anonymously)? You’d make me so happy.

So far I only have a few respondents, I’ll share the progress and results in the comments below!

Hi there!

i have a few apps in the store and im only using Admob right now. I've tried multiple times to add mediation but never done it completly ( i tried FAN, but i dont know if i dont know how to use it or what, i only make like 15$)

&amp;#x200B;

My fill rate is 95-99% so can anybody tell me if ill have beneficts adding more networks?

which mediation should i use? i do still like Admob, they pay without any problem every month and i receive it from Google Ireland, which is good as a European.

&amp;#x200B;

if the answer is yes, should i use Admob mediation or any other one like Mopub?

If i dont like how it goes, can i redirect all the traffic to admob and it will be as always?

I've like 3M impressions/month (i've no games, so i dont have any video ads or rewarded ads, dont want to annoy my users)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ive seen something like open bidding ads on admob, its on beta and i do not have access, i thought that mediation worked like that.
## [10][Emulator taking up too many cpu cycles](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jjjsl0/emulator_taking_up_too_many_cpu_cycles/)

Hi all,
I have a question about android studio emulator. Do you guys have an issue when android emulator is taking up too many cpu cycles? 
I have AMD Ryzen cpu wit 8 cores and 16 threads, 32GB of RAM. If I allocate for example four of cpu cores for emulator, their usage is peaking up to 100% at the same time when interacting with emulator. If I give to emulator more than 4, lets say 6 or 8 threads, it isn’t working any better but it is using all the cores and at the same time and again isn’t working very smoothly... AMD plugin is already installed.
Is it this unoptimized or something else is the problem? Do you have any tips how to make it works better?
Thanks
## [11][Is it just me or are layouts still bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jjl80n/is_it_just_me_or_are_layouts_still_bad/)

I feel like I always have to copy paste layout code/files and just modify them, because interface building from scratch is a nightmare and a massive time sink.

You're always missing some xml tag on some view somewhere, and it breaks everything so you have to spend 2 hours just debugging why the hell a certain view isn't aligned properly. And you find some question on stackoverflow with 2 upvotes saying "Oh for X layout, you have to use Y tag in combination with Z view, and place it at the bottom of the file, plus add some elevation to just display some basic crap."

The worst ones are dialogs... Can't use this root view or that root view. And if you use a certain root view it has to be in combination with some child view with a, b, c or parameter. And have to programmatically add these 5 lines of code... for a basic freaking dialogue.

I have no issues with Android Studio or Android development in terms of business logic/Java or Kotlin, but the GUI is just a nightmare and such a massive waste of time for basic stuff. I feel like Google has to start adding more warnings/compile time checks for building interfaces, instead of having to run your code and waiting to find out your view doesn't show up on screen or it's completely fudged up.

Hi,

I'm Andrea Cantone and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Salerno, Italy.

For my thesis work I am working on a study on the respect of accessibility in Android applications. 

I need to collect information from Android developers to understand the problems encountered in implementing accessibility guidelines.

I ask you to compile this survey and help me to spread it among your contacts.
