It is open source so you can edit it and make it your own. [https://github.com/ably/ouija](https://github.com/ably/ouija) I've also written up a very thorough readme which goes over how it all works which is in the repo.

I was getting "No overload matches this call" until I used `new Header()` to sneak my custom headers in via object.

Another option would be to use a global declaration file to extend the fetch global variable.

Should one turn to declaration files for custom headers in this case?

Hi, Is this a bug in Typescript on VS code?

or do I have to configure on my editor ?

&amp;#x200B;

basically, the type returned by the \`requestsHistory\` function should return the type of

DeliveryRequestHistoryResponseData (right).

but on the left side, it looks like my editor isn't working properly since the type inference is lost for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

[the issue](https://preview.redd.it/v48bpqkzket51.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd3bb6637388f9a1190014fcf7ac0b9b67b8a72)

EDIT:

    export interface DeliveryRequestModel {
    	... // ommited for brevity
    }
    
    export interface DeliveryRequestHistoryResponseData {
    	data: {
    		delivery_requests: DeliveryRequestModel[]
    	},
    	success: boolean
    }

I'm using angular v9 w/ typescript v 3.5.3

I feel like I run into this issue often and I never really understand the typescript rule for these cases. The typescript error I'm getting:

&gt;error TS2345: Argument of type '"" | "Learn More" | "Be Healthy" | "Be Fit"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Goal'.

&amp;#x200B;

Some example code:

    // this type is used else where throughtout the code
    export type Goal = 'Learn More' | 'Be Healthy' | 'Be Fit';
    
    // some of the component code
    ...
    class SomeComponent {
      goalList: Goal[] = ['Learn More', 'Be Healthy', 'Be Fit'];
      // 
      goalSelection$ = new BehaviorSubject&lt;Goal|''&gt;('');
    
      ...
    
      // error occurs in this method
      goalSelectIsValid() {
        const goal = this.goalSelection$.getValue();
        return this.goalList.includes(goal);
      }
    }
    
    ...
    // template example
    &lt;app-dropdown #goalDropdown&gt;
      &lt;div currentlySelected&gt;
        {{ (goalSelection$ | async) }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div dropdown&gt;
        &lt;div class="layout vertical options"&gt;
          &lt;button mat-button *ngFor="let item of goalList" (click)="updateGoalSelection(item); goalDropdown.open = false"&gt;
            {{ item }}
          &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/app-dropdown&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" [disabled]="!goalSelectIsValid()"&gt;

So when I'm writing this out, my thought process is that `this.goalList.includes` is just validating the value of `this.goalSelection$.getValue()` .. I know that `goalSelection$` can be an empty string, but I'm not setting any value that invalidates the typing of `this.goalList`.

This always trips me up, and I know it's a lack of understanding of typescript. 

In these scenarios, how should I better approach typing these variables?

Title.

I love C# and its static typing, so naturally Typescript sounds like the perfect gateway in to the whole "Javascript" universe, but is it wiser (for any reason) to learn actual Javascript first?

I keep getting compilation errors for the `access_token`, `expires_in`, and `token_type` properties as they don't exist on type `TokenResponse` which is what the `response` type is.  


Here is my code, please let me know what I'm doing wrong here:  


    type TokenResponse = {
      data: {
        access_token: string;
        token_type: string;
        expires_in: number;
      };
    };
    
    type TokenData = {
      access_token: string;
      token_type: string;
      expires_in: number;
      type: 'token';
    };
    
    const { data } = response; // response is type TokenResponse
    
    const token: TokenData = {
      type: 'token',
      access_token: data.access_token,
      expires_in: data.expires_in,

Hi, I think my example data structure is right for my use. I need to access the properties of the objects often, so want them to be accessible from expressions rather than having many temporary variables everywhere.

I want something like `testMap.get("x")[0].a` but it does not exist, can anyone tell me how to access the value `100` from the example in an expression?

    const testMap = new Map([
      ["x", [{ a: 100 }, { b: 200 }, { c: 300 }]],
      ["y", [{ a: 400 }, { b: 500 }, { c: 600 }]],
      ["z", [{ a: 700 }, { b: 800 }, { c: 900 }]],
    ]);
    
    // use get to access values of map directly
    console.log(testMap.get("x")); // [ { a: 100 }, { b: 200 }, { c: 300 } ]
    
    // use destructuring to get values of keys
    let { x, y, z } = Object.fromEntries(testMap);
    
    // use destructured value with array index and propety to get value (type check fails)
    console.log(x[0].a); // 100 but Property 'a' does not exist on type 'number'.ts(2339)
    
    // I want something like testMap.get("x")[0].a

I want to configure a CRA project to use Airbnb linting rules with prettier. Has anyone on this forum used `eslint-config-airbnb-typescript-prettier` plugin? Can it lint JavaScript files as well?

I would also like to know if this is the best options to go with or  `eslint-config-airbnb-typescript` with prettier would be a better choice?
