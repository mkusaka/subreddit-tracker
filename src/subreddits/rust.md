Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last week's thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fjef12/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

I just wanted to let people know about this crate,and the fantastic experience I had using it. 

I leveraged it to compute the best fit line for a point cloud in my react front end packed with parcel. 

The runtime is absurdly good. The whole cycle takes less than 23 microseconds. I haven't calculated the exact overhead, but it's basically nothing.

How did redox os create its gui? Did they use Piston, Amethyst? Did they use their OrbTK crate and if so how did it work bare metal (i.e. VGA stuff, honestly idek) how did they display on the computer Are there any rust crates that work for guis on bare metal?. Thanks (this question has been bothering me forever).

This was truly a facepalm moment. I was trying to figure out why a simple program is using ~130-150MB of RAM...
TLDR; `unset RUST_BACKTRACE` and boom 130MB down to 13MB RssAnon.

So I have started learning Rust, and so far it has been great. But my final goal is to build embedded systems and program microcontrollers.

I know that a lot of embedded systems support C/C++. But I would like to know the prospect of using Rust in this field.
For example, there are a lot of sensors that can be used with a raspberry Pi. If I use rust for development, will I face any major disadvantage while using them?
