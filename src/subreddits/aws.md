I can't describe how horrible this experience was.  I am not looking forward to how much work I am going to have to do to get my money back.  This is not my first AWS certification (I have SA Pro and DevOps Pro), but is my first online exam.  The short version is: Don't take AWS exams via the Pearson Vue at home option, even if it is offered.  AWS should not be offering this option as I can attest it is a waste of time.  Ironically, AWS would have us use their services because of their high availability and scaling but apparently they don't ask their test partners to do the same!

It started off easy enough: I passed the initial 'checks' as it confirmed my internet speed, camera access, and microphone access.  I started the process 15+ minutes before my scheduled exam time.  I was able to open the app, it again verified the technical requirements passed, and I went to the next screen.  It asked for my cell phone number and texted me a link which opened a web page which requested to take my photo.  Easy enough.  I did that and then the web page went to 'Uploading and verifying photo'.  A spinning circle started spinning.  This is where my test experience ended, but not where the poor experience ends.  I tried again, and then a third time.  Same experience.  As I write this, I left it on that page and the spinning is continuing.  This screen has been spinning for no less than 45 minutes.  At 8 minutes before my scheduled exam, I tried finding the help link.  A chat window opened, and I waited, and waited, and waited.  Still waiting as I write this.  My chat window has been open for 52 minutes and still no one to help.  Every two minutes I get ' All agents are currently assisting others. Thank you for your patience.' written in the window.  OK - what next?  They make it harder to find, but I got a phone number I can call.  I tried calling that.  Busy signal.  For the next 20 minutes I called back and back, busy signal.  Finally, I got it to actually pick up, but of course no human yet.  No estimate of time to when I can be helped.  They don't even have nice elevator music to listen to.  Who knows when I will be able to talk to someone.  This has been an exceedingly poor experience.

If you value your time, please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt a online exam with Pearson.  I worked hard to prepare for this exam and rescheduled things to fit around it.  Now, I will have to do that all again.

u/jeffbarr Is this the experience AWS is hoping to get with their testing partners?  This was a waste of my time and money.  Amazon should seriously reevaluate the quality of their test partners.  I understand everyone is trying to deal with all the issues.  However, if you can't offer quality testing, then please don't offer the option at all.  It isn't respectful to people's time.  Pearson is well aware of their capacity and if it isn't up to requirements, they shouldn't be scheduling test slots.

*EDIT*: A few background items I didn't initially share that may be relevant for others.  For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.  Other than a few applications like Office, there is barely anything installed on there yet.  I used a hard wired connection, like recommended by Pearson through the use of a usb-to-ethernet adapter.  I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.  It seemed like Pearson's servers were jammed at that point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Update*: After a LONG time, I did eventually get someone to answer from Pearson.  They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this morning I see a fully posted charge for the rescheduled exam, but no sign of a refund.  Sigh.  I will give it a few days and then start this process over.

For what its worth, people should IGNORE the advice that the web chat is the fastest way of getting help.  Find the phone number and dial and re-dial it as fast as you can when you get a busy signal.  Despite the fact that it took 20+ minutes to get the number to pickup (and was 'waiting' 20 minutes less from the phones point of view) I got a faster response from someone on the phone.  Web based chat never picked up, even though I left it running during my entire phone conversation.

*Update #2*: It took two more days than the charge, but the refund did show up in the correct amount on my credit card.  I am actually quite surprised.

Hi everyone, we have website on aws we recently got a warning mail for 80% usage even though no one has touched it in a month, is it because the instance was still running?

Sometimes my service crashes and gets restart automatically by ECS. However, it might get stuck in a restart loop due to a bug, bad data or deployment of a nonexistent task definition version etc... How can I set up an CloudWatch alert for this?

I am using boto3 in my activity workers and I came upon a TaskTimedOut when calling the SendTaskFailure:

    botocore.errorfactory.TaskTimedOut: An error occurred (TaskTimedOut) when calling the SendTaskFailure operation: Task Timed Out: 'arn:aws:states:eu-west-2:statemachinearn:activityname' 

I think this happens because the connection pool gets full sometimes which makes the request not being fulfilled (even though a new connection is created).

I know it is possible to set a timeout value for Tasks and Parallel States but that does not have anything to do with calling the send\_task\_failure/send\_task\_success methods.

Does anyone have any idea on how to solve this?

I have some application components that use S3 to upload images. They run in docker containers and are not all on aws themselves. They store their own key which has minimal privileges so I'm not very concerned about them, but I still would like to rotate these keys as a best practice and for future compliance.

I am curious what I need to do this? Should I have my python app run a cron job every 90 days to invoke the key change? Or can I change the way my app accesses the keys so it will get the new key without the app having to invoke the rotate functionality?

Can anyone give me a high level overview of how I can give my applications aws keys when key rotation is implemented?

In the current design, some keys are stored in a local database, and in some situations the keys are hard coded. Not ideal but hoping I can change that as well.

Thanks!

EC2 instance types directly impacts how much traffic it can support through its network interface, some consulting firms publish their own benchmarks. A benchmark from 2018 from [Cloudonaut.io](https://Cloudonaut.io) indicates 0.13 Gbit/sec baseline for t2.small instances.

Is there a CloudWatch metric I can look at that will tell me that I am reaching this limit? What I've been doing is looking at NetworkOut and NetworkIn (bytes) from CloudWatch for the EC2 instance \[sum statistic, over 1 minute, then dividing by 60 second to get Gbytes/sec -&gt; then convert to Gbit/sec or similar unit\] . 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this method accurate and is there a better way to do this? May be something like VolumeQueueLength of EBS PIOPS which is generally a good indicator if EBS is struggling to keep up with IO, but for network throughput.

For example with RDS databases, what are the pros and cons between autorotating every 30 days vs every single day?

I intend no disrespect to Redshift IDEs, but... I’m struggling to find one that isn’t awful. I come from a SQL Server world and trying to find footing in using Redshift. SSMS and Azure data studio feel like they are miles ahead of things like Aginity Workbench. Do you have a favorite IDE for redshift specific development that you could recommend?

Hello everyone,

I'd like to have some advises on my first deploy on an EC2 instance(s), because it's my first time on AWS.

I have a php website hosted on a shared server, and i want to migrate to a more scalable infrastructure due to sustain a massive load of requests.Right now i deploy/update the application by a gitlab webhook, and at every push on the master branch, my production environment got updated.

My goal is to deploy my application on EC2 with multiple instances, with a load balancer in front of 2/n servers

My questions are:

* Do i need to change something on my application (php code) because of the EC2/EC2 multi server?
* How can i deploy my application at the same time on all the servers?

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** the website communicate with a MySql database
