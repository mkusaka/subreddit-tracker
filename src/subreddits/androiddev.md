This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

More specifically, as I understand I can’t just snap my fingers, are there any tools you guys recommend I use to help me with this process?

Hi,

I'm trying to connect to a ble device. It works fine in most of the phones but it's not working in some of the Oppo models specially in  F15. Connection is failed whenever I try to connect to the ble device. I have tried connecting to the ble device even using the Ble Scanner app but it doesn't work in that too.

Are there any good lists of things to avoid when trying to optimize a production application for battery life?

Also, I'm looking for a good way to get battery data between app releases so that I can see if there's a big change in battery drain. Battery Historian seems to be good for this, but it also seems like it wouldn't always help me find where exactly the drain is coming from. Are there others tools I can use that would provide more information?

## [9][SSL decryption](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jqwbu9/ssl_decryption/)

Hello, I am currently reverse engineering an Android App. I tried to sniff the packets using Wireshark. The requests are sent encrypted. Now how can I decrypt them?  


I tried accessing the app's private files but it seems like that there is no key.  
My idea now is to use my own key to encrypt the traffic. Is it possible to import my very own key and force my android phone to only use my own key?  


Is that possible? Or are there any other possibilities I can try?

 My game is in pre-registration for days now, and I don't get any data on the storefront or the registration number whatsoever. (And I know for sure about a number of people who clicked on the Pre-register button but it shows 0). Should I contact Google?
