This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [6][Android Studio: Anyone knows how to setup for Android Gingerbread?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hf0ac7/android_studio_anyone_knows_how_to_setup_for/)

I need to develop an app that runs on earlier versions of Android, all the way down to gingerbread (Android SDK 9).

I am perfectly fine if my app(s) do not run on latest Android Devices. I need to write app(s) that run on `Android v2.3` (`SDK v9`).

I'm using `Ubuntu 18.04` and I installed the Android Studio 4.0 using the standard `snap install` stuff. Then I installed the `Android SDK v30` with the SDK manager. I let the Android Studio install the required components, `Gradle` and install the updates. After the mandatory restart, I tested a quick "Hello, world!" app to make sure everything is working.

Once I am sure everything is working fine, I installed the `Android SDK v9` again using the `SDK Manager`. Here comes the kicker: Even after installing the SDK v9, I cannot choose to create an app with `SDK v9`. I can only select the `SDK v30`. And I can only select the compatibility to `SDK v14` (Android v4.0 - Icecream Sandwich).

What am I missing?

I read that 99% of users spend most of their time only with the first 10 apps. Is the market for mobile apps dead? If this is the situation, isn't it better to focus on some hybrid technologies like React Native or even better simple web apps?

So first off the source:  [https://imgur.com/a/FyFDo2C](https://imgur.com/a/FyFDo2C) 

Now I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcfUkjlL9RI) and obviously, I changed it here and there to cater to my needs but generally I did what the guy said.

&amp;#x200B;

It crashes when I start the timer (aka when the read and write happens).

&amp;#x200B;

The timer was tested before and worked fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help since Idk what is wrong and I need to complete this project soon.
## [12][Bachelor thesis against unemployment](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hewewk/bachelor_thesis_against_unemployment/)

I am currently working as a student in the app development department of a company in the automotive sector. Due to COVID-19, all working students will no longer be employed from August.

I had a conversation today with the head of department there. It turned out that working on a bachelor's thesis would prevent me from becoming unemployed. Therefore, I have to find a suitable topic within this week or by next week at the latest, as this is the prerequisite for the Bachelor's employment contract.

Since I couldn't collect a list of interesting topics at such a short notice, I ask you if you have any ideas or inspiration. All research topics that are related to app development and may even have something to do with automotive are interesting. I appreciate any help!
