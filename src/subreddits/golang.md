For GoLand users - the latest release of Go (go1.14) breaks it. I've raised a support ticket;

Recently I've noticed a lot of posts about Gopher mascots. It doesn't bother me too much, but I'd be glad if I could filter them out. 

Some flair like "offtop" or "funny" could do. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

I'm working on a website in Golang because speed, but when I went to look and see how to put code files in sub directories because the main directory is growing, I found modules.

I don't understand modules at all. As far as I understand, they're rigidly named, they do nothing,  and they also do everything and are tools for galactic domination of autonomous self versioning and reference.

I just want to put a go file in a sub directory. I don't understand. I've read tutorial after tutorial and I just keep having the github atom editor go plugin blindly remove my import path when go vet runs. It's infuriating and depressing. it comes with a confusing error about "no result for query "latest""

let me tell you where I'm at:

my go env returns that $GOPATH is C:\\users\\me\\go

my github repository copy sits in ... me\\go\\src\\github.com\\samiam2013\\GoMVClean

go.mod for this repo says module github.com/samiam2013/GoMVClean

my subdirectory that I want to add code to is ... me\\go\\src\\github.com\\samiam2013\\GoMVClean\\modelConfig

go.mod for this subdirectory says module github.com/samiam2013/GoMVClean/modelConfig

I'm using go version 1.13 the 111 variable is not set.

Please refrain from hitting your caps lock key and calling me a retard. I know.

Thanks for any wasted time helping me, I'm sure I'm not worth it.
