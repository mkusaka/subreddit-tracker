I was excited to see that kotlin conf is just $600. I got to know that workshop is $900 and you can only attend one.  Is it worth that money? Any body attended those and care to share the experience, it would be great to hear from someone.
## [7][Creating an Android app and a Kotlin server. Multiple Modules or not?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/f9t69c/creating_an_android_app_and_a_kotlin_server/)

For a school project I'm making an android app. We decided to implement our server in Kotlin as well. I thought it would be useful to create a multiple module application so the data classes that are send from the server only have to be edited at one place. Is this a good idea? And how should I do this?

Hi guys, I've been thinking for a while that I want to shift into backend development from front-end.  
I've been hearing about Kotlin everywhere I go. I just wonder if Kotlin would be a nice starting point or if you would advice starting with a different language to learn?

Working with a group of researchers and they mainly know Java. What are the biggest advantages that Kotlin has over Java ?
