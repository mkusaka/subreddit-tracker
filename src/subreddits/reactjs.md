We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hi! I am Mo, and I am a professional React Programmer since early 2015.  

Since I am off for two months now, and due to the current situation I don't have many activities to do, maybe I could help out some people who are trying to learn React. 

My idea is to get together 3-4 people, and come up with a (fake) react project, and code this up together. This way you would learn it in a "real-world" setting, with similar flows and standards as a professional project. I would be a mixture of project manager and mentor. I would answer any questions you have, help you if you're stuck, review your code, give feedback, and always point you in the right direction. Afterward, you would hopefully have a decent understanding of react and the most common react patterns. Plus something for your portfolio. 

To join, all you need is some (demonstratable) understanding of JS, HTML, and CSS. Knowing git would also help.

[Let me know if you're interested!](https://585353ecb81346acb74dafed66d2.typeform.com/to/lDVqOi)

Edit: if you already have some code and/or a github profile, please share, so I can get a better picture of where you stand right now :)

Edit2: Really happy that there is a substantial interest! To keep track of all of you guys who'd like to participate, I added a small form to fill out. 
You can find it [here](https://585353ecb81346acb74dafed66d2.typeform.com/to/lDVqOi)!

ðŸ‘‹ Hey guys. I wrote an article explaining React through visual mental models. I think it's a great way to have an intuitive grasp of React. 

Iâ€™ve learned that the biggest difference between someone that has mastered a language, framework, or tool and someone who hasnâ€™t lies in the *mental models* they use. One person will have a clear and advanced one and the other will not.

So I have an app focused around sensors. I have a couple of pages with 1 major one being the `&lt;Dashboard /&gt;`. On my dashboard I show data from all the sensors in my system. I also allow users to take actions against sensors for example: add feedback comments.

I have used redux-toolkit and created a `dashboardSlice` with a bunch of thunks to achieve what I want. The key one being `addCommentToSensor`. 

Now I want to introduce the concept of a watch-list. This is basically a dedicated area on all pages of the app where you can see certain flagged sensors, even when you are not on the dashboard.

I will obviously create a new slice for this but the problem I am facing is how to keep comments synced between both the dashboard slices and the watch list slice. 

A user can add a comment from the dashboard in which case I'd like to update the watchlist slice data with the comment as well, so it is shown in the watchlist. A user can also add a comment using the watch list while on the dashboard page, in which case I'd like to update the dashboard data.

What is the idiomatic way of going about something like this?

So I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35lXWvCuM8o) video where the guy explained why and how to use context to manage state. Everything went well until he said following at [32:40](https://youtu.be/35lXWvCuM8o?t=1960)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the problem is every time we updates the code in our use context (I think he meant updating the state) all the components that uses this context are gonna re render

I don't get what he mean by that. Isn't that why we used `state` as context value. He mentioned `redux` as the better solution in the beginning of this video. Does that mean `redux` already have solved what ever the problem he is saying?

I'm using Slate.js to make a docs clone for my site. However, I want to disable copying and pasting on the doc. I googled this but nothing for react came up and I fiddled around with onCopy, onSelect but couldn't get it to disable copying and pasting. How do I get this functionality in React?

Hello everyone.

I'm currently building a website using React and I've noticed that some SEO tools (such as Alexa or Seositecheckup) don't pick up my header tags and various keywords throughout the app. I've done some research and found that react-snap is a good way to convert your single-page app into multiple static HTML files. Is this necessary? Are search engines such as Google or Bing unable to distinguish keywords on a react site?

Thanks in advance
