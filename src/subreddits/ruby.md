Is it truly possible to make a program write other programs? I know this may sound silly but I have been thinking about unsupervised machine learning, ruby and how things could work. 

Why ruby and not python? Because I have over 7yrs of experience and I love it. I really enjoy most of languages but I believe Ruby has a lot of potential because of simplicity and fun. Of course a complex project will have to interface with other languages as well.

How could meta-programming be used to mitigate complex A.I. issues?
