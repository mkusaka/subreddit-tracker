**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

This example is from cppreference:

    struct A {
      int&amp;&amp; r;
    };
    A a1{7}; // OK, lifetime is extended
    A a2(7); // well-formed, but dangling reference

Prior to C++20 , `a2` was ill-formed.

However C++20 apparently introduces *parenthesized aggregate initialization*, which is the same as list aggregate initialization except:

  * narrowing conversions are allowed, and
  * lifetime is not extended for temporaries bound to references.

My question is: why?? Surely this is just a whole nother category of bugs waiting to happen.  

BTW if anyone is looking for this in the standard draft, it first appears in N4860 dcl.init/17.6.2.2 -- NOT under the aggregate initialization section!
## [5][How supported is passing arguments to coroutine frames?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gogccr/how_supported_is_passing_arguments_to_coroutine/)

Hello reddit, how are you all?

A quick question about passing arguments to the coroutine promise.

According to [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines), the compiler must pass the coroutine parameters to the coroutine promise type if the promise-type c.tor matches the coroutine parameters:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;calls the constructor for the promise object. If the promise type has a  constructor that takes all coroutine parameters, that constuctor is  called, with post-copy coroutine arguments. Otherwise the default  constructor is called.

&amp;#x200B;

I also found this draft [here](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0914r0.html) that explains why we need to pass parameters to the coroutine promise c.tor (In my case, it's not a cancellation token, but an executor), and this draft (I don't know what's the status of it) suggests the same as cppreference.

What I did is this : I used the latest MSVC and I took my already-working coroutine implementation, and I changes the coroutine promise type c.tor to accept `Args&amp;&amp; ... args`. were the coroutine parameters passed to the c.tor? no. the compiler didn't pass any argument to the promise c.tor.

Looking at the resumable header, there is no way for it to currently be supported:

            static void _ConstructPromise(void* _Addr, void* _Resume_addr, int _HeapElision) {
                *reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(_Addr) = _Resume_addr;
                *reinterpret_cast&lt;uint32_t*&gt;(reinterpret_cast&lt;uintptr_t&gt;(_Addr) + sizeof(void*)) =
                    2u + (_HeapElision ? 0u : 0x10000u);
                auto _Prom = _Promise_from_frame(_Addr);
                ::new (static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(_Prom)) _PromiseT();
            }

Quit funnily, overloading the `new` operator to accept `size_t s,` `Args&amp;&amp; ... args` did work (like the draft suggested)

I did not try Clang to see if it works there.

What is the status of passing parameters to the coroutine promise c.tor? Is it in the standard? If we want a sophisticated coroutine (and not that bland, unusable "lazily executed" coroutine that the committee tries to shove down our throats)  we must have this mechanism.  How much is it supported across different compilers?

To elaborate on the title, consider a defaulted three-way comparison operator for a type:

```
struct MyType
{
    auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const MyType&amp; other) const = default;
    int value;
};

int main()
{
    MyType a{ 42 }, b{ 24 };
    return a == b; // works fine
}
```

Now if we change that three-way comparison operator to no longer be defaulted, but still have the same effect:

```
struct MyType
{
    auto operator&lt;=&gt;(const MyType&amp; other) const { return value &lt;=&gt; other.value; }
    int value;
};

int main()
{
    MyType a{ 42 }, b{ 24 };
    return a == b; // ***no longer works***
}
```

Godbolt: https://godbolt.org/z/uyqRo6

It is easy (but annoying) to work around by defining `bool operator==(const MyType&amp; other) const { return std::is_eq(*this &lt;=&gt; other); }`, but I feel like I shouldn't have to do that. 

Is there some logical reason why the equality operators can *never* be generated from a non-defaulted three-way comparison operator? 

I'm already aware of the potential performance losses with three-way comparisons on complex types, but for simple struct types I feel like this should be automatic and just as performant.

I want to start game development in C++. I thought it would be really cool if I could create a game in my terminal instead of a modern GUI.

This guy on YouTube has a cool console game engine [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoderCommunity/olcConsoleGameEngine) but it looks like the console game engine is only for windows.

Does anyone have any Github repos for console based Game Engines?
