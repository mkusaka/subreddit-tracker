Mystified about strings? Borrow checker have you in a headlock? Seek help here! There are no stupid questions, only docs that haven't been written yet.

If you have a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account, consider asking it there instead! StackOverflow shows up much higher in search results, so having your question there also helps future Rust users (be sure to give it [the "Rust" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust) for maximum visibility). Note that this site is very interested in question quality. I've been asked to read a RFC I authored once. If you want your code reviewed or review other's code, there's a [codereview stackexchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust), too. If you need to test your code, maybe [the Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) is for you.

Here are some other venues where help may be found:

[/r/learnrust](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust) is a subreddit to share your questions and epiphanies learning Rust programming.

The official Rust user forums: [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/).

The official Rust Programming Language Discord: [https://discord.gg/rust-lang](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

The unofficial Rust community Discord: [https://bit.ly/rust-community](https://bit.ly/rust-community)

Also check out [last weeks' thread](https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/iwxitt/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/) with many good questions and answers. And if you believe your question to be either very complex or worthy of larger dissemination, feel free to create a text post.

Also if you want to be mentored by experienced Rustaceans, tell us the area of expertise that you seek.

Hello, fellow Rustaceans,

I am new to Rust and started reading the Rust Book to learn it. When I lurked through it, I found Rust to have unique principles on how the language is designed and that really got me interested! I decided to choose it as my language of choice from now on and to learn something, you gotta do something so I did! This is it, my first ever project in **Rust**!

Introducing **binserve** ‚ö°ü¶Ä

A blazingly fast static web server in a single binary you can set up with zero code. üî•

**Features:**

* **Single binary with no dependencies and everything built-in.**
* **Blazingly Fast!** ‚ö° - it's built on top of Actix!
* **Handlebars** template engine.
* **Easy Routing**
* **Secure By Design**
* **Config &amp; Static File Assistance**
* **Supports Any Static File** (`Content-Type`)
* **Custom Error Page Support**
* And much more...

**Check it out!**

[https://github.com/mufeedvh/binserve](https://github.com/mufeedvh/binserve)

As this is my first project, I might've made some mistakes in semantics or in implementing things the Rust way, if you're free or want to help, please give me feedback/suggestions, I would really appreciate it! ‚ù§Ô∏è

`Ok(())` Thanks!

I have seen rust rising in popularity on the stack overflow survey over the past years, however, it seems to be rarely used? I am 16 at the moment and conflicted on which to learn. This will not be my first language so ease of learning, is not an issue.

Edit: and why should I learn said language?

Hi  


One thing that I have been thinking about (and exposed to when packaging rust crates for Debian) is that there is quite a few crates uploaded to [crates.io](https://crates.io) that have tests that depend on resources that are not packaged into the crate.  


This isn't a huge problem, as the developer hopefully runs the tests before uploading.  


But it's very useful to also run the tests when packaging a crate for different architectures, it's nice to discover [endian problems](https://github.com/elichai/random-rs/issues/3) or that char is [different on arm64](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/pull/194) before they reach production. 

I guess that the problem can be fixed by adding `include` sections in the manifest, but it would be nice if cargo tested this automatically before uploading it.

I'm thinking that adding a step to cargo package that unpacks the .crate into a temporary directory and runs the tests there would improve the ecosystem. Do anyone see any problems with that or have any other feedback?
