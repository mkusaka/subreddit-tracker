I just ran across this Apple job req for "[Software Engineer - Machine Learning Platform](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/226569/software-engineer-machine-learning-platform-apple?so_medium=Internal&amp;so_source=JobListing)".

Of note, it lists Go as the first of 5 "meaningful languages"

&gt; Strong software development skills, with proficiency in meaningful languages (ex. Go, Python, Java, Scala, C++).

Does anyone know about use of Go at Apple for Machine Learning? Is it a primary language as one could infer from its placement in the list?

Hi,

I'm trying to learn the fullstack life cycle of a software project. Thus I chose to re-design and develop Go Playground with modern stack. 

It's still WIP.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see the UI prototype here: [https://www.figma.com/proto/4A8v6n2GJetccFEzGg5Z49/Go-Playground-Revamped-v0.1?scaling=min-zoom&amp;node-id=2%3A2](https://www.figma.com/proto/4A8v6n2GJetccFEzGg5Z49/Go-Playground-Revamped-v0.1?scaling=min-zoom&amp;node-id=2%3A2)

&amp;#x200B;

And the code here: [https://github.com/cyantarek/go-playground-revamped](https://github.com/cyantarek/go-playground-revamped)

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions, comments, criticisms will be much appreciated

I am a frontend developer willing to master server side programming. Go is my first option but i am not able to find good resources which covers only server side stuff. Please suggest a course or book

Thank you!

I'm learning go and trying to understand what's happening here but I'm not sure what the right terminology is so it's difficult to look things up.

`ExportAppStateAndValidators` is what gets exported and called externally, so what's going on with the`func (app *NewApp)` right in front of it? 

Also, what is `app` in `app *NewApp`? A pointer to a new object of type NewApp?

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

`func (app *NewApp) ExportAppStateAndValidators(`  
`forZeroHeight bool, jailWhiteList []string,`  
`) (appState json.RawMessage, validators []tmtypes.GenesisValidator, err error) {`  
 `// as if they could withdraw from the start of the next block`  
 `ctx := app.NewContext(true, abci.Header{Height: app.LastBlockHeight()})`  
 `if forZeroHeight {`  
`app.prepForZeroHeightGenesis(ctx, jailWhiteList)`  
`}`  
 `genState := app.mm.ExportGenesis(ctx)`  
 `appState, err = codec.MarshalJSONIndent(app.cdc, genState)`  
 `if err != nil {`  
 `return nil, nil, err`  
`}`  
 `validators = staking.WriteValidators(ctx, app.stakingKeeper)`  
 `return appState, validators, nil`  
`}`

I am parsing a .h file that contains some values and putting those into golang maps. This is part of a port from python. in python basically a file with dicts is created and later accessed as simple as it gets.  

I am wondering if the same can be done in go by simply auto generating a file that contains the maps and their data ? otherwise the solution i have come up with is to have the maps in the parsing file itself and access them from there or something of that sort or simply write this out to a json file.

Edit : So basically i have a make file that runs the functions that parses the .h file and puts the appropriate values into a different file which contains the maps.basically in the maps package. Now do these statically generated maps stay put like with python dictionaries. or do i have to run the map generating file always when i run the program ? what i want are static one time generated key val pairs that's it.

I have some python implemented math calculations, such as a \* b / c \* d\^2. I want to serialize it in some format such that I can read it in Golang and do the exact calculations. The calculation could have  up to 10 variables and basic operators (+, -, \*, /, \^ etc.). Is there any available tools for this kind of problems?
