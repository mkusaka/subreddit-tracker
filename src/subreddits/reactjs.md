I‚Äôm from a .net world where an EC2 would run IIS. I‚Äôm not sure how to phrase the question but 
My question is. 

What runs React? My backend node API is on one EC2 and I want React on another EC2. After doing npm run build, what‚Äôs next?
I can deploy to the EC2 but what runs it. Does it need its own node/express web server?

I am using the react-snapshot package for pre-rendering for my blog site.  I replaced the build and DOM scripts as per the document. However, whenever I generate build, I get idbIndex is not defined error. How do you fix this? I searched google for the problem, but few people are having this problem and there is no solution. I know Firebase is causing this issue, but I can't fix it. Can anybody help?

I saw a post on Firebase and how easy it is to use to take care of a lot of things like authentication and security. However it is touted as ‚Äúbackend as a service‚Äù and I am worried that it won‚Äôt show my backend skills as well as if I just did the regular mern development. BUT if I go the firebase route and speed up development, I will have a lot more time to add more cool features that might let my project stick out. 

Would engineers checking my code care about this or am I thinking about it to much? It would definitely impress non technical people that might come across my project
