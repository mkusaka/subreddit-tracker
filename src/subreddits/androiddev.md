* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

## [4][[Q] Remote Logcat from Android to Android?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/gmm5kc/q_remote_logcat_from_android_to_android/)

I'm looking for an app that can do remote debugging from an android device to an other android device AND has a good and readable log formatting.

There are a ton of logcat apps on the market, but they can do only local logcat. 

The only app i found that have this feature out of the box is [Bugjaeger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.sisik.hackendebug&amp;hl=en). But the actual logging is pretty terrible, since it's not formatted in any way. 

There is an other solution called [Remote ADB shell](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgutman.androidremotedebugger&amp;hl=en) which can run logcat, and most importantly it's open source [Github](https://github.com/cgutman/RemoteAdbShell). So i could turn this into a remote logcat that suits my needs, but, i'm not super keen to do if there is an already existing solution.

Hello, I would like to ask you for brainstorm together. Does anybody have any idea what policies may break this app [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hubalek.android.apps.myandroidearnings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hubalek.android.apps.myandroidearnings) ?

I got email that update was rejected but there is only following:  


&gt;Â About the Google Play policy  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Google reserves the discretion to include or remove apps from Google Play. We may take action based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, a pattern of harmful behavior or high risk of abuse. We identify risk of abuse using various items such as previous violation history, user feedback, and use of popular brands, characters, and other assets.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Publishing Status: Rejected  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Your app has been rejected and wasn't published due to a policy violation. If you submitted an update, the previous version of your app is still available on Google Play.

There is no more information in the email from Google.

I tried to change some things but everytime it was rejected so I'm definitely on wrong path. So I would like to ask crowd for brainstorming. Thanks

I am finding methods for content protection in the form of digital rights management for documents. I have been through the various types of technologies they use for streaming services
I need to apply these to an Android application.
I'd be thankful if any of you could help me out or even share a resource for this ( I have been through the Android documentation already)

Let's say i wanted to download a workout app on Android, but wanted to change things up for my personal preference  would it be possible to decompile the contents of an app and make an exact copy of it but change a few aspects of it so i could use it for my own personal use.

Would this be possible?

Thank you

I am pretty new to android app development, I don't know which one should I pick but here is how I want it to work:

* It should run once in a day, I don't care what hour
* It needs network connection
* It can't be interrupted
* It takes around 3 minutes

I read about it in android documentation and it seems like WorkManager would suit me the best but I don't know how do I make it run everyday or if it's actually what I should use, can you help me?
