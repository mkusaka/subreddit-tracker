I post a lot of Rails content on YouTube, mostly around building clones or MVP's of well known web apps. This time I decided to do something different and revisit the Ruby language itself. My personal experience when getting into Rails was to skip most of the Ruby basics. It took a while before I went back to figure out the basics.

If you are like me then this video might be helpful (or if you are just starting your Ruby/Rails journey). I figured I would share here anyway in case it's useful to someone.

I'm planning to post some more Ruby content so would be open to suggestions about content ideas :)

I'm trying to implement tests using minitest, and I'm completely baffled. I feel like I've been dropped into some dysfunctional family where everybody knows the secrets but nobody talks about them. I've been searching for two hours trying to figure out how to do this and I can't find anywhere that just explains it. So, by all means, insult me, tell me I'm stupid, tell me I have no business being a programmer, whatever, but for the love of all that is good please give me ONE WORKING EXAMPLE. Here's what I need to do.

I have a directory (called "tests") will a bunch of files that run tests. I can run any file and it passes all its tests. Now I want to make a Rakefile that indicates to run all the files in "tests". Then at the command line I want to run "rake" and have it run all the tests and tell me if they all passed.

What does the Rakefile look like?
## [4][A Ruby Reference updated for Ruby 2.7](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ela6jc/a_ruby_reference_updated_for_ruby_27/)

**[Ruby Reference](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubyref/)** is intended to be most **full**, **actual** and **accessible** language reference. Most of the reference content is taken directly from Ruby documentation and reorganized for easier reading. The core docs were augmented with some quotes from the Ruby website, and some missing content that is written specifically for the book. The source of the book (rendering scripts, config, and unique content) is open and can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/tree/master/_src).

Today I am releasing the new version, which was fully re-rendered for Ruby 2.7 and also includes some content and style fixes. [Changelog](https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/blob/master/_src/CHANGELOG.md).

I hope somebody'll find this useful.

I'm looking to write my own DSL as a project for uni. Do any of you have any experience in writing DSL's ? If so could you point me in the direction of somewhere I can learn from? Thank you!!
