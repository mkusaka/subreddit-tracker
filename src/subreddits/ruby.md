I’m currently in rolled in a boot camp and I’m doing the course prework. They didn’t go over iterations and nested arrays well enough for me to fully understand it. 

Is there a good resource someone could point me to? 

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you all for your help!! I was able use .flatten on them once I sorted and got the strings out. Ruby has been a pain to learn via the schools curriculum.

Hi Ruby community!

I’m a computer science student from berlin and part of a research project where we want to understand how project management tools are used in software-development teams.  
That is why I am asking you: What are your opinions on the tools you use? Help me with my research by filling out the survey below!  
Thank you!

I don't know if this would suit anyone but I'm just putting it out there in case it could be mutually beneficial. I am learning Ruby and getting to the stage that I could really use someone to help explain some of the slightly higher concepts. I think I would be comfortable paying USD 10/ 30 mins (min 30 mins). I am motivated and a fast learner but sometimes there's no substitute for another human to bounce things off.

Hey guys,

I am getting an error in my code and I was wondering if you would be able to help. I have spent ages looking at the code and either don't understand or cant find where the error is. 

There are 3 files, they are all linked in a folder. The main file im looking at is text\_musci\_player\_w-menu.rb, the other two have data that will be used in the main file, and the other has code that helps slim it down abit.

The error im getting is:

 I'm trying to modify an excel file on my desktop using RubyXL. I'm currently running it through the Windows Linux subsystem. No matter what I seem to try I keep getting the following error

***"XLSX file format error: File C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\TestWorksheet.xlsx not found (Zip::Error)"***

This is my attempt to access the file:

***workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse("C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\TestWorksheet.xlsx")***

I have tried using escapes for the \\ as well as doubling each of them. Has anyone had this problem?
