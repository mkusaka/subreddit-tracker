We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

Just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

Hey everyone,

I'm a backend dev, and I'm askin for help, we have a web app at my job that was made with react.js as a frontend and Wordpress headless cms as a backend.

We came into the problem of SEO, we heard about too many things like using [prerender.io](https://prerender.io) , or build all over again with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or using [hydrate()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate) function built-in react.js itself, we are very confused about what to use or what to do right now, we don't have much experience over there.

So what do you think or you recommend if there is something better.

Any help would be much appreciated

Hi! One of the best things you can do during quarantine is learning a new framework, programming language or something entirely different.

But doing these courses feels kinda lonely and often you just stop doing them so I thought I‚Äôd create a site where you can find buddies to do the same course with (frankly this quarantine is becoming really boring).

The idea is that you talk regularly about your progress and problems you're facing so you can learn and grow together.

If you‚Äôre interested, take a look at [Cuddy](https://cuddy.netlify.com/) and sign up for the newsletter!

The current tech stack is: React, TypeScript, Next, Heroku, Netlify (landing page)

If enough people sign up I‚Äôll be happy to implement the whole thing this weekend, anyone want to join me building it?

Also if you've got questions or feature ideas please do let me know in the comments! :)

## [12][Creating a card game](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/fmwx96/creating_a_card_game/)

I'm creating a card game for me and my friends to play online but I need a little help

The code can bee found from here:[https://github.com/pete02/Korttipeli\_react](https://github.com/pete02/Korttipeli_react)

The picture of ui can bee seen in here:[https://imgur.com/a/bREDbFa](https://imgur.com/a/bREDbFa). It also explains what I want to achieve. Basically I want to have a card, that is visible to all players, and every player has a button to change that card. Once the button is clicked, it changes the card on all players. Also If you have the time and energy, I'd appreciate if you could also help me to create something, that keeps track of whose turn it is

Thank you everyone in advance
