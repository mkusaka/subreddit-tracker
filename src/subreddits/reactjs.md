We alternate between hirers (on the 1st of the month) and agencies/freelancers/jobseekers (on the 15th).  
If you are looking to post or reply to React job postings, please check [this month's Who's Hiring post here.][hiring:this month]

---

If your post or comment is removed wrongly, please [send a message][message:mods] to mods  
because Automods bot is not perfect :)

---

Top Level comments must be Agencies and React Devs available for contract/permanent work.

Please include Location or any other Requirements in your comment. You can choose to use this format if it helps:

## (Fulltime | Contract | USA | Remote)

or

## (Agency | Europe | Remote)

Then we recommend adding a 2-3 sentence bio as well.

Not required, but may help:

- Link to Github/Portfolio
- Notable [r/reactjs][r/reactjs] submissions
- Preferred stack
- Former companies or clients
- Design or backend dev experience
- anything else you consider relevant. Put on your best show!
- Listing years of experience NOT required, it's a poor metric

If you are looking to hire, you can send a PM, or reply so that others might see your job opening.  
**Note**: Due to the sensitive nature of availability while currently in a job, users may be using alternate accounts.

For more ideas on what to include, look at the [last Who's Available posts][available:last month].

If you just want some portfolio feedback, check the stickied post below.

Good luck! #WriteOnceApplyEverywhere

I am trying to export a table from React to PDF. But all solutions convert the HTML to an image and place it in the PDF file. 

I need a real PDF with selectable text. Does anyone has suggestions for me?

It is using the API made by u/jakewmeyer from r/spacex! There's possibility to browse upcoming and past missions, see info about them, see rocket information and various stats from the program :)  
It is still in development so any ideas on how to improve it/what to add are very welcome!!

I am developing a react redux application. There are places where a single operation does multiple store dispatches. Every dispatch updates the store and even though it only updates one or two react components, it's getting expensive because React tree reconciliation on the entire app is taking a lot of time. Any changes I can make to make reconciliation faster? Thanks in advance.

[https://github.com/iKrushYou/use-axios-api-call](https://github.com/iKrushYou/use-axios-api-call)

I've been using this code that I've written across a handful of apps that I've made over the last year or so and I finally decided to wrap all the code up into a package. I tried to clean things up but there's definitely some room for improvement here. The inspiration started from a tutorial I had watched a while ago where the guy made a hook-based API call so I expanded upon it by adding cancellations, transformations, and handling of outcomes.

Let me know what you think

I have an interview tomorrow guys and [here's the JD](https://imgur.com/a/dChpZsj). How best can I prepare for this? Based on the points in the JD, what or which concepts should I focus on? I only have about 18 hours to get ready.

For number 3 of job requirements, is it OK to tout the Context API? I know many fans swear by Redux but I'm not a fan and haven't used it. But I'm very much familiar with the built in Context API and can describe it fully. How should I tackle point 4 of the job requirements? Otherwise, in the job requirements, 1, 5 and 6 are quite straightforward for me. What should one who "masters" React know, or be capable of? That's for point 2.

As for the bonus points: I'm also an Angular guy too so that covers the TypeScript part. Pretty much little to no knowledge of GraphQL, but I'm aware of the hype around it. As for point 3, I can visualize data with Chart.js, so hope that helps. Nothing for the last point, but I do have my GitHub username on my resume.
## [12][React app + web server + api backends with docker](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/g8xfpy/react_app_web_server_api_backends_with_docker/)

So I've created my react app using CRA and I can create a docker image with nginx+static html files since its the defacto standard from every site I've found.

If you run that with multiple backend/api servers/microservices. Would it be ideal to split off the docker react/nginx into two images? As a separate webserver. 

(Or even run another separate nginx in front, but I don't want to introduce complexity with 2 nginx's).

It would be nice to have nginx serve both the CRA and redirect "/api" endpoints over 443/80.

Otherwise the alternative is:

1. Have nginx (from the CRA docker image) handle proxying all /api calls, which means upgrading the frontend results in the all the backend apis going down.

2. Leave CRA+nginx and serve the "/api" directly over another port say 8090, but I would like to have that api behind an nginx image.

This nginx image would also handle SSL termination and reverse proxying for the react app + "/api" endpoints.
