Over the last year at work I have been using Kotlin almost exclusively, and as a result I am most comfortable with it now. I find that now when I write Java I make lots of dumb mistakes like forgetting semicolons or the `new` keyword. Previously Java was my go-to interview language but given how little I write it I think these small mistakes would give a poor impression if I continued to use it during coding live challenges. 

Does anyone have experience going on the interview circuit using Kotlin for these challenges? How was that received? I'm a huge fan of the language but I recognize that many companies have outdated views on it, perhaps thinking of it as an exclusively Android tool (I'm a backend dev). Were companies generally receptive or did they raise eyebrows when you would use it? 

The other option I am thinking is investing time learning more Python. That is a nice interviewing language in general and the syntax is different enough that I think I can effectively switch from "kotlin-mode" to "python-mode" without too much fuss. The downside is that I don't have nearly as much experience in this language.

I'm actually from a python only background. I have basic syntax level understanding of both C++ and Java, but I'm planning to move forward and explore the Java APIs for Spark, Flink, Presto, Kafka etc **using Kotlin instead of Java.**   


I'm the crazy guy thinking that scala is going to be doomed soon because of the way it's headed. So people please let me know  whether skipping most of Java and straight away learning Kotlin and building hadoop stuff is possible/advised?  


I dont think I'm violating any of the subreddit rules. but if mods feel its bad please remove it!   


Thanks!

I started developing android app with Kotlin. Before that, I had some java, oop knowledge. I want to develop a backend with Kotlin. Can you give a sample project? I have never developed a backend project before. Which way should I take? As a result, how can I become a "Backend" developer?

Hi guys just to know how can I call functions like this

when(userInput){
       "buy" -&gt; buy()
       "fill" -&gt; full()
       "take" -&gt; take()
}

userInput should be one of those word but the functions shows me like error in the IDE
