Hey,

I will start by saying that I absolutely love go, it is the perfect imperative language IMHO. Even the error handling and parametric polymorphism with interfaces is something I highly enjoy.

One issue is, the job vacancies pool is highly limited and/or in very specific fields - devOps, banking, real-time.

I would like to expand to another language with the same mindset, simplicity and elegance, with a strong stdlib support, and hopefully not too many ways to do the same thing.
As far as I concern it can be strictly functional, but must maintain the spirit of Go.

I would pick a JVM based language like Clojure or Scala, but I hate Java with a fury passion.

I thought about Python, it seems to check all the boxes with Python3.

Obviously I aim t stay in the same field, server/backend engineering.

What do you think?
