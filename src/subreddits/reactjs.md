I've been a React developer for 3 years now but had a 7 months pause because of other Projects.

Today, my online-teacher introduced us to React Hooks. I read through the [introduction page to hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) and understand hooks, but what i don't get, why would I prefer functional components having states, over the old fashioned Stateful or stateless components?

In my honest opinion, Hooks just look like a fancy way to get the job quickly but maybe nasty done.

E.g. `useEffect` combines multiple lifecycles, but runs twice on componentDidMount.

Anyone care to disagree or enlighten me what the real advantage is?

If i remember correctly, I've also read sometime ago on r/webdev a user who ranted about Hooks presenting more issues than solving them in the longer run.

Code:https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tmoss0/NHL-Search?file=/src/Team.js

I'm working on querying the NHL API and displaying data for each team. Currently I can display all the teams, but when I click my link to the roster page for each team, it doesn't fetch the roster API link (from what I see in console.log, it's undefined).

Any way to call it once the link is clicked? Looks like useEffect/useState won't work here like it does for my
## [11][How to test firebase functions in redux saga?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gdbbg0/how_to_test_firebase_functions_in_redux_saga/)

 I'm trying to test the function below:

    export function* signInWithEmail({ payload: { email, password } }) {
      try {
        const { user } = yield auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
    
        yield call(getSnapShotFromUserAuth, user);
      } catch (error) {
        yield put(signInFailure(error));
      }
    }

I have looked into `redux-saga-test-plan` as well as other saga testing libraries but can't seem to figure out how to test firebase function if it's not called with saga effects.

I need a way to mock firebase function at the same time being able to test that this line is being called `yield call(getSnapShotFromUserAuth, user);`

Thanks in advance!

Demo : [https://bit.ly/tic-tac-toe-online](https://bit.ly/tic-tac-toe-online)

Repository: [https://github.com/NiketanG/tic-tac-toe-online](https://github.com/NiketanG/tic-tac-toe-online)

Before you all get me about all those bad code practices, barely working pieces, in my defense, I'll say this is my first React Project.

It's just an online and 2 Player version of the Tic-Tac-Toe app provided as a tutorial on React website.

The game is to be played between two players. One player creates a game, which provides a unique game id, the other player can join the game using this ID.

Moves are stored in a database, the back end is managed using Python - Flask. Sockets are used to make and retrieve moves.

When both players leave the game, the game ID automatically gets deleted ( It works only if you press back button to leave the game, idk )

Any suggestions/fixes are welcome. Thank you.
