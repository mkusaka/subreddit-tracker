I'm a Java library developer and would like to improve the Kotlin integration of a few projects of mine (e.g. [BoofCV](https://boofcv.org),[EJML](https://ejml.org),[DDogleg](http://ddogleg.org/),[GeoRegression](http://georegression.org)). Named arguments are fantastic and it's always annoyed me that Java does not have them. I was a bit surprised when I learned you can't even do that from Kotlin. I'm willing to modify my build scripts to enable Kotlin to have this feature, but it appears to be impossible by design. See this [discussion](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/what-is-the-reason-for-not-allowing-named-arguments-for-java-interop/4571). Is there a way to trick Kotlin into accepting named arguments?

Which takes more time to learn?  To become an android developer using Kotlin/Java or to become a Java developer working at a firm with their Enterprise Java?  

I finished my first Java for Dummies book and now I dont know if I should switch to learning Kotlin to make android apps or if I should continue with Java and look for a job as Junior Java developer.

I found myself making many projects again and again for kotlin multiplatform over the last 6 months. I have written plenty of multiplatform project in enterprise settings in past few months, and expect to write many more in the coming days. So, to help folks out there looking to get their hands on the kotlin multiplatform, I made this. Feel free to use as you see fit. Made this mostly for my own necessity initially, but thought it would also help people out there.

EDIT: Just wanted to point out that the project has setup to produce output on maven local, or publish to aws(what I generally do), and for iOS it has a custom gradle task to produce a "Fat Framework", that also does setup for compilation of that framework right from xcode itself.
