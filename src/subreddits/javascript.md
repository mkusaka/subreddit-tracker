I know that one of the limitations of JavaScript is that it’s single-threaded (partially remediated by being event-driven), but why isn’t the option for multi-threading more accessible in modern frameworks like Angular and React? Angular goes about it a pretty roundabout way, but I think we’d benefit so much by having the option to stash away any computationally intensive work like sorting/filtering into a web worker until it’s ready. What are some downsides to web workers that I’m missing?

Hi everyone, i'm on the hunt for a 'starter' job here in the UK in the dev scene.

I'm just looking for a paid, low end dev job that is willing to take people who didn't go to uni, do you think learning JS/Node etc will give me the best chance at landing something like this?.

I have been learning HTML/CSS and CyberSec/basic JS stuff on and off for a while now and i'm not gonna have the chance to go to university, people keep telling me JS/FrontEnd jobs are the most popular in the UK and they are screaming out for people willing learn and start in the lower paid positions.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
