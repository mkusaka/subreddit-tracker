 Hello, my developer comrades, so basically I was laid off in March, 2 weeks before my co-op term ends.

And I graduated from college during the pandemic in April. Since then I'm trying to find a job :(

It's a really tough journey when you don't have experience that much, but as you seen I didn't give up yet :)

I'm asking you guys for suggestions? I don't know what I'm missing rather than experience.

Here you are my portfolio website,

I'll appreciate any suggestions, do not hesitate to dm me. Cheers!

## [8][Experiences of ejecting from CRA in prod?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i2u06c/experiences_of_ejecting_from_cra_in_prod/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/i2u06c/experiences_of_ejecting_from_cra_in_prod/

I'm looking to eject from CRA between two releases of production software. This adds ~1600 lines of configuration scripts. I'm not sure if I want to gradually remove things I don't need and hope that it will untangle itself, or just start over from a new alternative webpack config. Either way, does it make sense to just get the eject over with and then hope to eventually clean up the mess?

It certainly seems non-trivial. There's lots of fixes for and interactions between yarn pnp, webpack, typescript, eslint, jest, dev server, proxy, and HMR (which has actually been broken in CRA recently). And it could be hard to verify things like the chunking strategy and typescript/babel runtime helpers and polyfills.

Any insightful words from those who have gone down the same path?

As for the motivation, it's mainly to learn what's going on. It's a massive black box in the project, it's bloated, and has required special treatment to get things working in the past. It's making me uneasy.

I was reading about XSS or all kind of stuff and wondering sending the password in the  JSON stringify is alright to do or is there a better way to do this?

Hi,

I used svgo/svgr to transform popular svg icons sets so it can be  copy/pasted as React components. Hope you find this useful.
