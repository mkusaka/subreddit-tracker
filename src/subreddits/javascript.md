## [9][[AskJS] Bundling an extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/gi6scb/askjs_bundling_an_extension/)

I am creating an extension, with the following structure

```
extension/
         - index.html
         - index.js
         - src/
               utils.js
```

The index.html looks like this
```
....
&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
....
```
Here app.js is the name of the output bundle file

And the index.js looks like
```
....
chrome.tabs.executeScript(tabs[0].id, {
    file: 'src/utils.js'
});
...
```

When I bundle this with webpack, with index.js as entrypoint, the bundle is successfull. However when I load the extension, it says cannot find 'utils.js'. Directly referencing index.js in index.html works. Is there any other tool which is used for extensions, or am I doing something wrong?
