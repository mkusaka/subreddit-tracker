I know Exposed is 0.x software, but I was wondering if it or Ktor was in production use by any of you guys.

I'm currently using both for a professional project for a client.

Would like to hear your experiences.

I have background in proramming.  I come from c#.  I'm trying to create my first android app using Kotlin.  I was wondering if it is possible to create my own chat app (without using twillio, other chat platforms sdk, or the phone number of the phones (via SMS)).  

--

I cannot seem to find any tutorial on this matter.

--

1 - Is it possible to send data directly between two phones (can use mobile data network)?

2 - If so, are there any tutorial out there for this?

3 - Is there a built in android library for what I'm trying to do?

4 - Would I be able to test this app using the android VM?  The the SDK allow launching two android VM simutaneously?

Thanks.
## [6][Reversed index?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hmh0wi/reversed_index/)

Hey guys,

is there a way to parse a string by a reversed index, indicating the starting index from the end of the string? Like in Python one could call:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; word = "bumblebee"
    &gt;&gt;&gt; word[-3:]
    "bee"

Is there a way to get the same result in Kotlin?

Thank you very much in advance!

Hi!

I am new to kotlin. I have this project which I'd like to have some kind of "map" of it. I've seen this kind of tool where there is some kind of graph where function calls are represented by arrows, and I was wondering if such a thing was available for kotlin.

[Github](https://github.com/Gabgab2003/WikiaKT/)

I wrote an API Wrapper (wrote = about 60% of API methods implemented and no tests yet, pretty WIP) for the Wikia API. If someone wants to offer Feedback, implement some methods, or write Tests, you are free to do so.

Id love some feedback on the namespacing, as I wanted the API to be as close to the original API as possible, which is why every module (\`Activity\` for example) is a class, as that allows people to call \`api.activity.(somemethod)\` which looks better than \`api.activity(Somemethod)\`

I can see Kotlin 1.4-M3 artifacts are being pushed to the `kotlin-dev` channel.  

However I can't find a build of the IDEA Plugin. Any idea where I could look? I would like to avoid building it myself.
