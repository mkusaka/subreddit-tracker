**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I wrote this little utility for myself. Really happy with performance :) so far. Throughput on my notebook (i7 macbook) is 50k - 60k files / second.

Not a professional C++ developer so anyone has feedback on the source, that'd be nice.

The blog post goes over architecture and aggregation logic in detail, as does the README on the repo. Used boost::filesystem and AppKit for the GUI; not much more.

SYCL is an open standard developed by the Khronosâ„¢ Group that enables  developers to write code for heterogeneous systems using standard C++. 

 [ISO C++ and SYCL Join for the Future of Heterogeneous Programming](https://www.codeplay.com/portal/06-09-20-iso-cpp-and-sycl-join-for-the-future-of-heterogeneous-programming)  


by Michael Wong, Codeplay Software

"SYCL was designed from the ground up to be ISO C++ first, then augmented with heterogeneous support"  
Michael  Wong has written aboud how SYCL is evolving and aligning with ISO C++  to bring portable heterogeneous programming to all.

I was creating a fun chat database project to practice data structures. I'm basically letting users join chats. Chats can be associated with multiple users and users can be associated with multiple chats. When a person leaves a chat, his current chat must become the chat he was last associated with. I should also be able to let users leave chats and chats to be terminated entirely. I'm also allowing users to make contributions to these chats (just incrementing the number of contributions made in a given chat). Currently, I'm trying to use a hash map to store the number of contributions made for every chat. I'm also using a hashmap to store the chats every user is appreciated. The goal is to make it as fast as possible. Any suggestions appreciated!
