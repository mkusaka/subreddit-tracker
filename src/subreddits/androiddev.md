This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Normally I don't post stuff like this, but guys I can't help myself. 

For several months Google Play is removing apps and even developer accounts of myself and other Android developers which I am friends with and or who I work with.

Often times Google employees (or their algrithm?!) suddenly come up with a ridiculous reason to suspend an app without any chance of recovery. For example what happened to me yesterday:

" "After a recent review, we found that your app XYZ (xyz) is not compliant with one or more of our Developer Program Policies. See below for more information about your appâ€™s status and how to correct the issue.

About the Device and Network Abuse policy and sections 4.8 and 4.9 of the Developer Distribution Agreementâ€‹
We donâ€™t allow apps that interfere with, disrupt, damage, or access in an unauthorized manner the userâ€™s device, other devices or computers, servers, networks, application programming interfaces (APIs), or services, including but not limited to other apps on the device, any Google service, or an authorized carrierâ€™s network.

App status: Suspended

Your app has been suspended and removed due to this policy issue." 

This app had more than 50k downloads.

They literally suspended my app because of a hyperlink. Within my app I linked to a legit website and it says "you can find more information here".

Google sent me a screenshot of the hyperlink within this email and named it as the reason. I am wondering how does this violate the above policy? It is not disruptive (the link was somewhere below), it is not damaging (just a website with text) and it is not unauthorized (users can press on the link if they want to).

This kinda "bullying" with constant app removal for such reasons is happening all over the place. What is going on with this? Meanwhile, it seems some developers (not big companies) are untouchable even tho they are obviously breaking the policies. 

Now you guys can say: Just send an appeal, but both of us know this isn't going to work out. 

This makes it INCREDIBLY difficult for developers like me and you to have a workflow, staying motivated or to trust Google.

Hi, I built an [Android library](https://github.com/girish3/Vlog) to display logs right on your phone. This can be useful in many scenarios. (screenshot below)

[Github Repo](https://github.com/girish3/Vlog)

**Motivation**: All investigation starts from logs. Whether it's an app crash, server error, or login issue, we always check logs to understand the root cause. Quite often, we need to reproduce the issue ourselves and parallelly look for logs on our Mac or a PC. If only, there is a convenient way. Well, look no further, [Vlog](https://github.com/girish3/Vlog) makes it possible to display logs in real-time while you interact with your app. For more details, click on this [repo page link](https://github.com/girish3/Vlog).

as the processors are developing at fast rate, is there any "smart" sense that drop the requirement of traditional battery calibration protocols?

For the past several years the 13-inch MacBook Pro has been my go-to machine for Android development. I'm currently in the market for a new laptop, but since Apple has moved to ARM I'm wondering whether being an early adopter is such a good idea. Apple seem to be saying that Rosetta 2 will make the transition seamless, but I'm still wary about running into issues. Overall, there doesn't seem to be much information available at the moment. Does anyone have any thoughts, or is anyone else in a similar position?

TL;DR: Is Android Development likely to be a good experience on the new ARM Macs?

Hi, I have got a teeny tiny 250GB hard drive in my laptop. I can't find any LineageOS ROM for my phone. Is that enough to compile a version of Android for my phone? Thank you.

Just got burned by this today at work. We use the androidx.transition library to do some animations, but ran into some really weird bugs after we bumped to targetsdk 29 (which is now required for all apps). We hadn't messed with anything relating to transitions in a while, so it took a really long time to track it down.

TLDR: Make sure you are on at least version 1.2.0 of androidx.transition when you target API level 29
