Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create top-level comments for **meta** discussion and **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely (permanently, or for the duration of the pandemic)? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or C++20? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I have decided to write a raytracer for my University project. However, I was wondering what could be done to make it different. I've seen lots of source code out there on how to make the raytracer. But I was hoping to add some other cool elements to it. I'm not sure if this is possible but what do you suggest or think is doable but not impossible. Thanks

## [10][Updates in Dragonbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ishdj9/updates_in_dragonbox/)

Hi all, Dragonbox ([https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox)) is a float-to-string conversion algorithm with:

1. Round-trip guarantee,
2. Shortest number of digits guarantee, and
3. Correct rounding guarantee,

which performs better than Ryu and also my previous algorithm Grisu-Exact.

I already have posted about Dragonbox two weeks ago here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ika6ml/dragonbox\_yet\_another\_floattostring\_conversion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/ika6ml/dragonbox_yet_another_floattostring_conversion/)), but I shouldn't have done that at that time because it was quite incomplete, though I couldn't really realize. Sorry for spamming! :(

Now I think it is finally sorta completed, and perhaps this is a better timing to share it with you guys.

Here are some updates:

1. I finished writing a [paper](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/blob/master/other_files/Dragonbox.pdf) for the algorithm. I hope it is readable to anyone who are interested in this topic, but I know my writing is horrible, so please give me some feedback if you ever have tried reading it.
2. Fixed some bugs in less-tested rounding modes. I believe they are all correct now.
3. Added a version using a compressed cache table for `double`'s. It uses only about 11% of static data table compared to the original one, at the cost of being about 20% slower. (The original one uses about 10KB, while the new one uses about 1.1KB.) It is but still way faster than the double-conversion library, for example.
4. Did more tests, including exhaustive test for `float`'s against a reverse (decimal-to-binary) conversion algorithm and confirmed successful round-trip of every single `float`. Now I'm pretty confident about the correctness.
5. Simplified the way of passing policy arguments.

Please check the repository ([https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox)) if you are interested, thanks.

I'm planning to work on things like Ryu-printf and string-to-float algorithms from now on, if time permits. I would appreciate it if you guys can share some interesting ideas or thoughts.
