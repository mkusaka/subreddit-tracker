[Doodle](https://github.com/nacular/doodle) is a pure Kotlin UI framework for the Web, that lets you create rich applications without relying on Javascript, HTML or CSS. Check out the [documentation](https://nacular.github.io/doodle) to learn more.

This release fixes some minor bugs, while adding new documentation for [drag-and-drop](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/#/dragdrop). Doodle has very customizable support for data transfer, including drag-and-drop for files, which was added in version 0.3.0.

Feedback is always appreciated.
