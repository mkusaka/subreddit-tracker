Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

Hi All! I am super excited to share my first open-source project and I would really appreciate your feedback. üôè

It is an open-source platform for android developers that generate boilerplate code for implementing MVVM architecture in activities, fragments, and adapter using Dagger, lifecycle comp., Data binding in order to help developers build apps way faster.

Download the [release](https://github.com/sagarmahobia/kickstart-android-template/releases/download/1.0.2/release.zip) and start using it. This is in early-stage right now.

The best way to learn more is to visit the project's GitHub repository ( [https://github.com/sagarmahobia/kickstart-android-template](https://github.com/sagarmahobia/kickstart-android-template) )

The project is just at the start of its way, any feedback, pull requests or new issues on Github (**or stars** üòÅ) will be very much appreciated!
