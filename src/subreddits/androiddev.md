This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

 Hello ! I have launched " Disable Touch" a simple app which allows you to listen to movies or even the online classes when your phone is in your pocket without the worry of accidental touches by disabling the touch using our touch-control-panel .It can be also used over popular apps like YouTube,Amazon Prime Videos and even over Netflix to 'binge-listen' ðŸ¤ª movies. Would love to hear what you people think about it !!!

This is what I get when trying to start my android emulator. Im using the latest version of Visual Studio

Device error: WARNING: unexpected '-prop' value ('monodroid.avdname=pixel_2_pie_9_0_-_api_28'), only 'qemu.' properties are supported WARNING: unexpected '-prop' value ('emu.uuid=4b63b139-cc77-4b66-9200-0d25f8fc545e'), only 'qemu.' properties are supported.

I have been googling this all day and nothing resolves the issue.. Yes, my system is compatible, I have HAXM installed, everything is up to date, ive followed every step ive found on google and other threads but even those people are still experiencing the issue. Its extremely frustrating as I cannot work on anything.
## [9][Do you think Google Map SDK will ever get features available on default Google Map app as a ready to use Fragment or something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jtsgrv/do_you_think_google_map_sdk_will_ever_get/)

google map sdk for android has a lot of good things, but it is still lacking far behind in features compared to map app you have on your phone. At the moment people have to roll out these features in their app, which could spell trouble with Google's "No Competing Product" clause ( I wonder how taxi apps like Uber get away with it). Or you can kick of Intent to fire up the map app which is a separate app.  


How do people deal with it?

Since a lot has changed in Big Sur and Macbook being my development machine, I just want to make sure before upgrading that Android Studio works fine or not otherwise will have to take leave from work.

I am using miui-ify to have my notification/status bar at the bottom. I managed to hide the notification bar at the top, but i can still drag it down. Is there a way to completely disable the notification/status bar?
