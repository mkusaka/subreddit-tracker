**Don't talk about the coronavirus. r/cpp is not the place to discuss or debate the coronavirus.**

# Purpose

Many C++ conferences, meetups, and even the next committee meeting have been affected by the ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.

I think it will be helpful to everyone to collect information about C++ events that have been or may be affected by the coronavirus. That includes not only cancellations/postponements, but also events that are planning to move forward but may be impacted in the future

**This is intended to be a living document. Please help by suggesting changes or additions.**

**Last Updated: 2020-05-11 - Email, Tweet or Slack Bryce to request updates.**

Rules For Individuals
---------------------

* **Don't** create top-level comments - those are for employers.
* Feel free to reply to top-level comments with **on-topic** questions.
* I will create one top-level comment for **meta** discussion.
* I will create another top-level comment for **individuals looking for work**.

Rules For Employers
---------------------

* You must be hiring **directly**. No third-party recruiters.
* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.
* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.
* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the "formatting help" says, use \*\*two stars\*\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.
* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.
* ðŸš¨ **Updated Remote section.** ðŸš¨ You must follow its guidance, or your post will be removed.

---

\*\*Company:\*\* [Company name; also, use the "formatting help" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Type:\*\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Description:\*\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Location:\*\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Remote:\*\* [ðŸš¨ **Updated!** ðŸš¨ Is this permanently a remote job, or is this remote (including new employee orientation) for the duration of the crisis? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones? If you require programmers to be physically present, please explain either why you're essential infrastructure (e.g. programmers must physically interact with manufacturing/medical equipment) or why you're recklessly foolish.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Visa Sponsorship:\*\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Technologies:\*\* [Required: do you mainly use C++98/03, C++11, C++14, C++17, or the C++20 working draft? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Contact:\*\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]

I am an embedded C and C++ dev. Recently I enabled -Wconversion and -Wsign-conversion in my project and it just forced me to write correct low-level code (ofc I use -Werror ;) ) which I wouldn't have done otherwise. I felt bad that I did not enable them all along.

And when I went to the warnings page of  GCC &amp; Clang, there was a huge list of warnings. Definitely I don't want to enable each and every one of them.

For now, these are the list of warnings I have enabled in my project - 

&gt;\-Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic-errors -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion

Now my question to the community. What all **compiler warnings** do you enable in your day to day job/ hobby project? Which of them is a must have for all C++ devs in your opinion?

P.S: Feel free to add your story on how it helped you catch a bug early on in your project. :)

Reproduce [https://godbolt.org/z/eFavH7](https://godbolt.org/z/eFavH7)

Guys, can you please help me with this. Is it standard behaviour or implementation defined or I am doing something wrong?

UPDATE: Do I understand correctly that friend functions placed in some special scope, so they are not visible from anywhere except by ADL? Is it described somewhere in standard (sorry I am fairly new to this)?
## [12][The Darkest Pipeline (TDP): A C++17 library for building multi-threaded software pipelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gmvlmu/the_darkest_pipeline_tdp_a_c17_library_for/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gmvlmu/the_darkest_pipeline_tdp_a_c17_library_for/
---
Hello fellow redditors, 

I've just published my most recent library, which I'm calling **The Darkest Pipeline**: https://github.com/JoelFilho/TDP

**The Library**: Allows simplified construction of multi-threaded pipelines, by using a declarative style. It handles all thread management, and inter-thread communication.

It's header-only, written on C++17, and released under the Boost License.

**Examples**:

    auto pipeline = tdp::input&lt;float, float, float&gt; &gt;&gt; std::fmaf &gt;&gt; tdp::output;

The line above instances the most basic pipeline type, and starts threads responsible for processing (1). 

It then allows the user to call `pipeline.input(float,float,float)` to enqueue data, and `pipeline.[try/wait]_get()` to obtain the output.

    auto pipeline = tdp::producer{read_str} &gt;&gt; process_str &gt;&gt; tdp::consumer{print};

This type of pipeline executes `read_str` without user input, processes it, then calls `print`, without additional user output interfaces. Producer, processor and consumer are individual threads.

**Features**

- Defined at compile time with an embedded DSL, and using stack storage anywhere it's possible
  - `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` wrappers are provided to allow ownership transfer/sharing
- Multiple types of input and output (user-provided vs independent threads) allow versatile definition
- Allows selection of internal communication data structures, which are suitable for different applications:
  - Queue (blocking)
  - Triple buffering (blocking or lock-free)
- One thread is launched per pipeline stage
- Pure RAII interface: Threads are created on construction, and stopped on destruction.

**Motivation**: In my last job, I worked with video processing on embedded Linux. As the ARM CPU couldn't handle the processing at hard real-time, it needed a multi-threaded pipeline solution for consistent frame rate. After manually instancing different threads and explicitly communicating between them, I realized it could be simpler and less error-prone. So I wrote TDP. 

---

The library still needs a couple of additions to become feature-complete, but it's usable in its current state. The [examples](https://github.com/JoelFilho/TDP/tree/master/examples) should give an idea of the range of the current features.

As always, I'd love to hear your feedback.
