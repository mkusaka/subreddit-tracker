This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

It seems more weightage is given to reviews that are recommended more.

So if user A leaves a review, and thumbs up similar reviews,  his opinion is given more weightage than user B who only leaves a review.

What are your thoughts?

Hi everyone! 

I just published my new blog post: 

"How to perfect android animations using MotionLayout." 

 I talk about how MotionLayout made it simple and straightforward to create complex animations and why animations are not a designer only tool anymore. 

 You can read it here.

 If you liked it, I would love it if you share it with your friends.

I am having a dilemma right now. I am about to release a game for Android only for the mean time, as I cannot afford to port it to iOS yet (developer account, mac os, iphone &lt; I do not have these). I'm afraid someone will decompile my app and recreate the game for iOS or for any other platforms. I am using Android Studio to develop the game.  


How do you protect resource files from being decompiled. There's proguard which obfuscates code, how about for drawables, fonts, etc?   


And also, what action can you take against someone who steals your app and uploads it as their own. Example they upload it to the app store under their developer name. I will have to prove that I own the app and uploaded it first to Play Store, but this will be hard, won't it?  


The game I am making is a visual novel so there's a lot of original content (character images, script, etc) within the app.

Hi guys,  
I've created a lightweight and a highly customizable custom view to render a curved line graph.

You can have multiple data sets to represent different information.  
Please check it out,  [https://github.com/swapnil1104/CurveGraphView](https://github.com/swapnil1104/CurveGraphView)

Feedback is highly appreciated,   
especially a better name for the library, I'm not good at naming things! x(

I love how Google deprecates things then gives one sentence details on alternatives.  How do you communicate from a Service to an Activity without a LocalBroadcastManager?

I am using a library in one of my projects that has some per-compiled C++ code. Some of the classes have these 'hats' on them (DeviceFilter, and USBMonitor). What does this mean?

* **Do you clone a favorite Android boilerplate repo?**
* **Do you start an empty project and build on a core framework/library?**
* **Do you start as simple as possible to avoid over-engineering?**

There are many threads on the "perfect" Android architecture project.

Curious what you're *actually using* when starting a new project.

# Background

My friend built an iOS app.

You can search and browse audio files, and there is a player for the audio files.

I'm building the Android counterpart.

While I'm starting the project, other devs will likely maintain it.

Right now we're building a native app for each platform, but open to multi-platform solutions.

# Requirements

1. The next developer can hit the ground running quickly. The documentation that I write focuses on the business logic and special customizations.
2. An opinionated Android template that encourages the "right way" to do something.
3. Flexibility for custom solutions when necessary.

Below are personal preferences, but open to learning new things :)

* Great documentation
* A good test setup, examples, and the project inherently encourages tests &lt;- my biggest weakness!
* MVVM/MVI with Clean Architecture
* Kotlin, Coroutines, Dagger 2, Retrofit, Navigation, ViewModels, LiveData, Room
* Has been updated in last 12 months
* Easy to bring in project fixes from upstream (e.g., a core Architecture bug fixed)
* Flexibility for multi-module support

## [12][How can I achieve similar synchronization to google docs ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/el9xif/how_can_i_achieve_similar_synchronization_to/)

I have a similar issue to google doc: I have to synchronize an input text field of my app between multiple instances on different devices.

I tried Firebase but this gave me very poor results, it look more suited for other use case, like a tweet feed, where each user can write or edit its own message and see others changes in real time but not edit the exact same field at the same time.

Do you have any idea what could I use to achieve the desired goal ?
