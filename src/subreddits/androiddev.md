Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

We’re on the engineering team for Android Jetpack &amp; Jetpack Compose, and we are excited to participate in another AMA on r/androiddev on **Thursday, August 27**!

For our [launch](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html) of the [Android 11 Beta](http://d.android.com/android11), we introduced [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid), focusing on a new topic every week. We’re excited to close out our [\#11WeeksOfAndroid](https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid) with a focus on UI, and on Thursday we’ll be hosting an AMA on the Android Jetpack and Jetpack Compose!

[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is our suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We launched several new libraries like Hilt for Dependency Injection, App Startup, and updates to Paging, Navigation, CameraX, and more.  Check out the Jetpack updates we made during #11WeeksOfAndroid [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-jetpack.html).

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI - declarative, composable, and more! We’re currently in developer preview and excited to show you more next week, when we will focus the week on UI! Check out our overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5BwfqBpiWU) and try the [tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial) to learn more.

For this AMA, we want to answer your *technical* questions about Android Jetpack and Compose.  No roadmaps :)

We'll start answering questions on **Thursday, August 27 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT (UTC 1900)** and will continue until 1:20 PM PDT / 4:20 PM EDT.

**Feel free to submit your questions ahead of time.** This thread will be used for both questions and answers. Please adhere to our [community guidelines](https://developer.android.com/community-guidelines) when participating in this conversation.

## [5][Implementing search](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/idvcf8/implementing_search/)

Hi guys, new to this subreddit and relatively new to android. Not sure if this question has been posted before, i couldn't quite find it.

I need to implements search in my app, and since it's my first time doing it i googled a bit. I found out people do it in a number of ways. Google docs recommend SearchView widget with search activity and all that, but i've also seen people do it with just an EditText and updating/filtering the list.

So my question is: What's the correct/best way to implement search?

I'm trying to add the Google's Funding Choices SDK to ask the users permission for personalized ads, following this doc: [https://developers.google.com/admob/ump/android/quick-start](https://developers.google.com/admob/ump/android/quick-start)

But reading their policy here [https://support.google.com/fundingchoices/answer/7362965?hl=en](https://support.google.com/fundingchoices/answer/7362965?hl=en)

&gt;Additionally, it is your responsibility to implement a link that allows  EEA and UK Users to revoke any data decisions previously made by a user  pursuant to the IAB Requirements in your privacy policy.  The link  should make clear to users that it will revoke decisions made around  both consent and legitimate interests, and not merely revoke consent.   Possible language for such a link includes *“Click here to reset your data sharing configurations.“*

But they don't explain what exactly does this link, how am I supposed to revoke any consent if my apps doesn't have any user management nor logins? Has anyone implemented this SDK ?

Folks,

Which site would be best to learn Android between google Codelabs or the official udacity courses (the free courses)?  The udacity course is recommended in your FAQ, ive been thru 3 of the modules already but some of the content is &gt;5years old and dated.  Whereas the codelabs  "Android Developer Fundamentals Course" seems to have been updated 6months ago and isnt mentioned on the FAQ?

Im also trying to read thru the official google documentation to supplement whichever part im learning,

Thanks

I am a new developer with only a single app in the play store. I am still refactoring and rearranging my code because I originally followed the official guides and as a result skipped a lot of best practices that I had used in regular projects. Lately I have been seeing a lot of concern about how Google is handling Android with rapid changes all over. Should I be concerned about all this and how should I proceed? What would be best for me to adopt as I am still new and don't have to unlearn anything? I feel I am not wording things correctly but I hope you get my point.

I just upgraded to Android Studio 4.0.1 and noticed that the normal extend/shrink selection keyboard shortcuts no longer work i.e. option+up and option+down .

Turns out its's now cmd+w and shift+cmd+w

*"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later (7100000)"*

Anyone else getting this? 

EDIT: Can you guys access the chat option? I can't but if anyone else maybe they can do us all a favour and contact Support about this in real time?
