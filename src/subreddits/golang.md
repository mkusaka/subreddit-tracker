## [6][How to think interfaces in a CRUD app ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/i74ma5/how_to_think_interfaces_in_a_crud_app/)

Hello,

I have a designing question regarding interfaces and CRUD design. I usually end up with some sort of repo interfaces as such :

`type UserRepo {`

`Create(name, email string) (int, error)`

`Read(id int) (User, error)`

`Update(name, email string) error`

`Delete(id int) error`

`}`

Is it the right way to "think" interfaces ? I keep hearing about small interfaces and their efficiencies but I have a hard time figuring out how it looks in a real world CRUD app.

Also my interfaces tends to grow too big because of that when methods adds up.

## [9][Does anyone have experience with QOR (github.com/qor/qor) CMS library on Go?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/i711zo/does_anyone_have_experience_with_qor/)

I am now choosing a CMS on Go to build a front-end for our REST API. I have found QOR [https://github.com/qor/qor](https://github.com/qor/qor) library. I am in hesitation on whether to use it or not because there is not much documentation and there are several issues still open from 2016. Therefore I have several questions:

Does anyone have experience with QOR CMS?

If yes, would you recommend using QOR CMS worth using it?

Do you have any other suggestion for CMS on Go?

P.S.: By CMS on Go I mean not only written on Go, but also is used on Go.
