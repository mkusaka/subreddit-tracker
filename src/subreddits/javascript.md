Hey everyone!

I'm building an API solution to offer dynamically generated og-images. My server uses express js and I want to apply an X requests/month limitation. I'll implement a user authentication system and possibly use Stripe API as well. However, I could find any resource/guide on how to set up everything properly.

Do you have any advice or recommended service/library to suggest?

https://skribbl.io/ is the website. The game is that 1 of the players draws a word &amp; then others have to guess what the word is. So i thought it would be cool to dig into the website using the Chrome browser console using "Inspect Element" &amp; try to find the answer to mess with my friends! However, i couldn't find the answer anywhere after "ctl+f"ing a lot inside the console. Can someone help me to check if there indeed IS a way to find out the answer by doing Inspect Element? Any ideas are appreciated, thanks!

TBH i don't even know JS, but have been practising Python &amp; Ruby since the past 4 months so trying to dig around things now and then.
