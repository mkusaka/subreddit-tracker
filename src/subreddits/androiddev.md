Here's your chance to talk about whatever!

Although if you're thinking about getting feedback on an app, you should wait until tomorrow's App Feedback thread.

Remember that while you can talk about any topic, being a jerk is [still not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_comments).

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

Also, please don't link to Play Store pages or ask for feedback on this thread. Save those for the App Feedback threads we host on Saturdays.

Can you have a paid app on Google Play Store, and have the same app for free on F-Droid and Github. Will this go against Google TOS, Google Play Store TOS, or not be legal for licensing or something.

 I wanted to know that is it possible to create a vision accessibility app which is a floating window that inverts color on screen? Example, zoom accessibility feature? If yes, where should I look for?

LG Vision accessibility, Window zoom

Hi All! I have limited experience with Android Dev and want some guidance on how to make a responsive pattern lock UI that draws pattern on the screen. Please tell me approach on how I should begin so that I will try it out. My current idea is to use a Grid layout and set an Adapter to it to determine if a dot is touched and use MotionEvent to connect the dots as long as the user is touching the screen. Is there any api that lets us handle when the user releases finger from the screen?
