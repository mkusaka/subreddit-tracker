## [2][Single value as a return type?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ha1pog/single_value_as_a_return_type/)

VSCode doesn't lint if I set the return type as a static value. I have an orchestrator method that should only ever err or return true:

       public run(): true {

Another option is to just set it to `void`. That actually sounds more sensible.

Does it ever make sense to set the return type to a static non-void value?

I came accros this code! I'm a bit confused on the first code and what the differences between the 2 are! 

    // first
    const logNumber: (i: number) =&gt; void = (i: number) =&gt; {
      console.log(i);
    };
    //Annotating the  variable with (i:number)? And the function must return void? 
    //Why are we anotating the variable with (i:number)?
     
    // second
    const logNumber = (i:number): void =&gt; {
      console.log(i);
    };
    //annotaitng the function, where i must be a number, return type must be void

Idk if I found a bug or something is going over my head, but I've written out a super simplified example of code I wrote where the type error is displayed, and one where it is not.

[example code 1 (error)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/MYewdgzgLgBAygFQKIAUD6BJAIjAvDAbwCgZSYAzASwCdoAueATwFsAjEAGwDpyRqAKAOQBGQQEoANCTIQApqDAATBnBbtuvAYIBM4qQF8iRKIwAOs+FFmm8haaUrKYENZwDc9mGFkAPKAH4VK1MPQyIFaGdgiCDrAG0AXVs4z2IydJhHFWR0bB4aaCkMsm8-BgJMp0RUTCwuOQVFGH0isha7YocqnNr6+XBFVuLSqAYAVyVZKm9Bz0MEjyJyCeAoSnAKSiU4YIAhRgxFfmhrQ4YAa1lGEHIYE3Mb+B7sMQ6yDllYE9NYmwAfGATRRTLayJr4b4QOIABgWRnSlFu-AAhN9XmlOtRPmNqGAPOkwukAO4AC0oHxgx2CXEcMGRuHw1VyWDi30OCXRnnSEVgI1s3y4I0WnUySORI1eWKgOLx8M631sQrmctIUplUWsoSIQA)

Does anyone know why the guard at line 24-26 in example code 1 does not work, but does work in example 2? I'm fairly confident in my TypeScript abilities but this one is not making sense in my brain.

An example of a branded type is:

`type USD = number &amp; {__brand: "USD"}`

You can then cast numbers to this type with \`as USD\`. However, I don't understand how this works. How can you intersect a primitive with an object? I thought objects could only be intersected with other objects, `object`, or `any`.

I have a typescript code like above where I create a JSON Object called bodyusing doorand windowarguments. Typically the body should be:

    {     door: 3,     window: 4 }

What I want is if \_args.dooris empty/blank, the bodyshould be

    {window: 4}

It should not be: {         door: undefined,         window: 4        }

Hello everyone!

I‚Äôm currently working on a react component library for my own personal use and so far I‚Äôve built my components, compiled them to JS and it all works as expected when I import my lib from a new project.

However when I import the lib, TS demands a .d.ts file... to override this while working on my lib I just had TS ignore the missing .d.ts file.

But now I‚Äôm ready to actually supply this file and I‚Äôve never written one.

I read some of the TS docs this morning and although I‚Äôll appreciate any input, my main question is:

Where does the .d.ts file go?

Do I put it in the root of the lib where node_modules is?

Do I put it inside of the src folder?

Or am I creating a .d.ts file for every module of my lib?

I‚Äôm just throwing this out there, any input is appreciated! Thank you! üôèüèΩ
## [10][String Literal Propagation Issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h9laux/string_literal_propagation_issue/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h9laux/string_literal_propagation_issue/

I'm trying to propagate a string literal through a function argument while also accepting another generic type. What I'm trying to do is get the result of the action and put it in a list of actions for a switch case Here is where I'm at.
```
export function generateAction&lt;Payload, T extends string = string&gt;(
	type: T
): [T, (payload: Payload) =&gt; { type: T; payload: Payload }] {
	return [type, payload =&gt; ({ type, payload })];
}

export const [SWITCH_SECTION, switchSection] = generateAction&lt;{ section: number }&gt;('SWITCH_SECTION');
export const [SWITCH_SUBSECTION, switchSubsection] = generateAction&lt;{ subsection: number }, 'SWITCH_SUBSECTION'&gt;(

type actionTypes = ReturnType&lt;typeof switchSection&gt; | ReturnType&lt;typeof switchSubsection&gt;;
```

By specifying the payload type it makes the string generic dumb and doesn't use the string literal. If I use the below the string literal is preserved.

```
export const [SWITCH_SECTION, switchSection] = generateAction('SWITCH_SECTION');
export const [SWITCH_SUBSECTION, switchSubsection] = generateAction('SWITCH_SUBSECTION');

type actionTypes = ReturnType&lt;typeof switchSection&gt; | ReturnType&lt;typeof switchSubsection&gt;;
```

Any idea how to preserve the string literal while also specifying another generic?
## [11][Must I always extend protected members to be protected?](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h9g59c/must_i_always_extend_protected_members_to_be/)
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/h9g59c/must_i_always_extend_protected_members_to_be/
---
I have something like this:

    abstract class Base {
        protected description: string = ``;
    }
    
    class Subclass extends Base {
        private description: string = ``;
    
    }
    
    /* class Subclass
    Class 'Subclass' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
      Property 'description' is private in type 'Subclass' but not in type 'Base'.ts(2415) */

I don't plan to extend `Subclass` so I thought marking `description` as `protected` would not be necessary or very clear to others. I therefore thought `description` in `Subclass` should be marked `private`, but only the `protected` keyword avoids errors.

Can anyone help me understand why `protected` is needed here?

Is the case simply that any time you extend a class you must identify overwritten members with the `protected` keyword?
