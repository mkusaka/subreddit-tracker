This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

Does a new app automatically get mentioned on gaining popularity, Or do you need to apply for it separately?

I'm looking for a resource or hub to learn and collaborate about phone hardware and writing software for it at the bare metal level.

I'm aware of Lineage OS and I guess in practical terms you could also phrase my question as "where are the resources used by Lineage OS devs when they are trying to port to a new phone?"

I want to come up with novel uses for old (and new) phones and create resources for others who are interested in doing the same.

Thanks

Hi! Not a developer, but an app marketer here. Hope I'm not breaking any rules with this post.

Anyway, has anyone noticed delays in Google Play store listing updates recently?

I know that due to Covid the app review times have increased but does the same apply to store listing information like app title, description, screenshots, etc.?

It used to be 2-3 hours at most, but now it's been almost 2 days since I changed the store listing information and it hasn't gone live on Google Play yet.

Should I start to worry and contact Google Play support or is it normal during these times?
