This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), [our Discord](https://discord.gg/D2cNrqX), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

I have already completed a few demo apps made in Android, but what is next for me?

I browsed job posts online as well as freelance projects and a lot of them feature requirements like needing apps developed for both Android and IOS. 

So do I need to start learning Flutter or Kotlin Multiplatform in order to tackle these jobs? I still would like to specialize in native Android development, so I fear that I might end up shooting myself in the foot by not being able to find any freelance work to do - or even full-time work at a company for that matter. 

Also on a somewhat related note - what are employers' actual perception towards developers without a CS background, who learnt Android development through self-study? Am I going to be at a serious disadvantage simply because I didn't choose CS as my undergrad major a decade ago?
