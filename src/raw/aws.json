For the computer, I used a fully up to date Windows 10 laptop.  The laptop itself is only about a month old and is in near pristine condition.

I have Verizon FIOS (980Mbps/840Mbps) and did do a speed test way after it was apparent this would not work.  I forget the exact numbers, but I was still pulling in hundreds of Mbps in both directions, despite everyone being at home and using the USB ethernet adapater which does put a cap on my speed, but I can't see hundreds of Mbps not being sufficent by orders of magnatude.  My phone is a fully up to date pixel 3.  I tried using my wifi in my house first (connected through FIOS), and then using the phone 4G LTE connection.  I can't imagine this was caused by my end.

They were nice enough and were fairly easy to understand, although there was an delay echo introduced where whatever I said was echoed a quarter to half second later which was annoying, but bearable.  I was just happy she was able to hear me.  She said she could open a trouble ticket for me, but as it was well over an hour trying to get through to any human and doubtful it was on my side, I just told her to schedule me for the next available in person appointment.  She had to cancel my appointment and then rebook it as their sub-standard system wouldn't let her reschedule an at home appointment to at a location.  Surprisingly, she said they would refund my money and rebook me.  It was painless enough, but when I asked for a reference number on the refund, all she could do is say I 'should' get an email.

So far so good.\n\nThe next challenge is that I would like to be able to filter based on all the other columns in the table: last\\_visited, opened, revenue, balance etc. without knowing the shop\\_id. All filters are optional except last\\_visited which is compulsory. So I make the following decisions:\n\n1. Since using **query** call requires you to use the partition key (shop\\_id). I need to create a GSI. Ok great.\n2. So now to select a GSI hashkey, knowing that last\\_visited is the most common attribute in queries, I select that as the **partition key**.\n3. BUT it turns out, I cannot perform a \"BETWEEN\" condition on the partition key, and therefore must use **scan** (which is discouraged).\n\nThe way I see it, inside dynamodb it is impossible to have a date key as partition key while using the query operation. This seems like a fairly common scenario. **(Please prove me wrong).**\n\nThe only other method I can think of is using last\\_visited as both the partition key and the range key inside a GSI.

So it seems fine to have shop_id as the partition key as a large number of cases requires me to retrieve a single shop.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So at this point I am fairly certain that I can select shop_id as the partition key for the table, making inserting and selecting single record by id very fast. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next challenge is that I would like to be able to filter based on all the other columns in the table: last_visited, opened, revenue, balance etc. without knowing the shop_id. All filters are optional except last_visited which is compulsory. So I make the following decisions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since using &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; call requires you to use the partition key (shop_id). I need to create a GSI. Ok great.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;So now to select a GSI hashkey, knowing that last_visited is the most common attribute in queries, I select that as the &lt;strong&gt;partition key&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BUT it turns out, I cannot perform a &amp;quot;BETWEEN&amp;quot; condition on the partition key, and therefore must use &lt;strong&gt;scan&lt;/strong&gt; (which is discouraged).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, inside dynamodb it is impossible to have a date key as partition key while using the query operation. This seems like a fairly common scenario. &lt;strong&gt;(Please prove me wrong).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only other method I can think of is using last_visited as both the partition key and the range key inside a GSI. But this feels a bit wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Am I missing something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side question: are all other filter fields are included as LSIs. &lt;strong&gt;Are LSIs also operational on GSIs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "cd6512b2-b9e3-11e6-af4d-0eb0735f94c0", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh84", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "hgs0t0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "exact-approximate", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/aws/comments/hgs0t0/dynamodb_filtering_by_date_partition_keys/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hgs0t0/dynamodb_filtering_by_date_partition_keys/", "subreddit_subscribers": 128302, "created_utc": 1593257598.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "aws", "selftext": "I have a django app deployed to elastic beanstalk:\n\n[http://django-env.eba-bcvm9cxz.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/chart/](http://django-env.eba-bcvm9cxz.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/chart/)\n\nI'm following this tutorial: [https://medium.com/@elspanishgeek/how-to-deploy-django-channels-2-x-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk-8621771d4ff0](https://medium.com/@elspanishgeek/how-to-deploy-django-channels-2-x-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk-8621771d4ff0) and using architecture number 2.\n\nMy relevant configuration files are the folllowing:\n\n        option_settings:  \n          aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:\n            DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: dashboard.settings\n            PYTHONPATH: /opt/python/current/app/dashboard:$PYTHONPATH\n          aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:\n            WSGIPath: dashboard/wsgi.py\n        \n          aws:elbv2:listener:80:\n            ListenerEnabled: 'true'\n            Protocol: HTTP\n          aws:elbv2:listener:5000:\n            ListenerEnabled: 'true'\n            Protocol: HTTP\n\n\\--\n\n        files:\n          \"/etc/httpd/conf.d/proxy.conf\":\n            mode: \"000644\"\n            owner: root\n            group: root\n            content: |\n              ProxyPass /websockets/ ws://127.0.0.1:5000/websockets/ upgrade=NONE\n              ProxyPassReverse /websockets/ ws://127.0.0.1:5000/websockets/\n\nI needed to add \\`upgrade=NONE\\` in proxy.conf, which isn't in the tutorial, but I for me I always got a 503 on the client when it was establishing the websocket.\n\nI have a daphne server listening on 5000, which is successfuly receiving the websocket request from the client, but the client never gets to receive the response from the server.
